 [Braintree?                         1762 - 1763]," Miss Jemima I have taken the best Advice, on the subject of your Billet, and I find you                     cannot compell me to pay unless I refuse Marriage; which I never did, and never                     will, but on the Contrary am ready to have you at any Time. I hope  Conscience                     has as good a Memory as mine.  "
Octr. 4th. 1762," By the same  that the Bearer hereof satt up with you last night I hereby order you to give him, as many Kisses, and as many Hours of your Company after 9 O'Clock as he shall please to Demand and charge them to my Account: This Order, or Requisition call it which you will is in Consideration of a similar order Upon Aurelia for the like favour, and I presume I have good Right to draw upon you for the Kisses as I have given two or three Millions at least, when one has been received, and of Consequence the Account between us is immensely in favour of yours,  "
"Braintree Feby. 14th. 1763
","Dear  Accidents are often more Friendly to us, than our own Prudence. I intended to have been at  Weymouth Yesterday, but a storm prevented. -- Cruel, Yet perhaps blessed storm! -- Cruel for detaining me from so much friendly, social Company, and perhaps blessed to you, or me or both, for keeping me at my Distance. For every experimental  knows, that the steel and the Magnet or the Glass and feather will not fly together with more Celerity, than somebody And somebody, when brought within the striking Distance -- and, Itches, Aches, Agues, and Repentance might be the Consequences of a Contact in present Circumstances. Even the Divines pronounce casuistically, I hear,  ""unfit to be touched these three Weeks."" I mount this moment for that noisy, dirty Town of  Boston, where Parade, Pomp, Nonsense, Frippery, Folly, Foppery, Luxury, , and the soul -- Confounding Wrangles of the Law will give me the Higher Relish for Spirit, Taste and Sense, at  Weymouth, next Sunday. My Duty,  owing! My Love to Mr. Cranch And Lady, tell them I love them, I love them better than any Mortals who have no other Title to my Love than Friendship gives, and that I hope he is in perfect Health and she in all the Qualms that necessarily attend a beginning Pregnancy, and in all other Respects very happy.  "
April 20th. 1763," Love sweetens Life, and Life sometimes destroys Love. Beauty is desirable and Deformity detestible; Therefore Beauty is not Deformity nor Deformity, Beauty. Hope springs eternal in the human Breast, I hope to be  next Fall than I am at present, and this Hope makes me happyer now than I should be without it. -- I am at  Braintree but I wish I was at  Weymouth! What strange Revolutions take Place in our Breasts, and what curious Vicissitudes in every Part of human Life. This summer I shall like  Weymouth better than  Braintree  but something prompts me to believe I shall like  Braintree next Winter better than Weymouth. Writers who procure Reputation by flattering human Nature, tell us that Mankind grows wiser and wiser: whether they lie, or speak the Truth, I know I like it, better and better. -- I would feign make an original, an Exemplar, of this Letter but I fear I have not an original Genius.  is gone to Ordination, I know. I have not seen him, nor heard of him, but I am sure that nothing less than the Inspiration of his Daemon, that I suppose revolted from him somewhere, near the foot of  Pens-Hill, could have given me Understanding to write this Letter. This is better Reasoning than any I learned at Colledge. Patience my Dear! Learn to conquer your Appetites and Passions! Know thyself, came down from Heaven, and the Government of ones own soul requires greater Parts and Virtues than the Management of Kingdoms, and the Conquest of the disorderly rebellious Principles in our Nature, is more glorious than the Acquisition of Universal Dominion. Did you ever read Epictetus? He was a sensible Man. I advise you to read him: and indeed I should have given this Advice, before you undertook to read this. It is a silly Affectation for modern statesmen to Act or descant upon Ancient Principles of Morals and Civility. The Beauty of Virtue, The Love of ones Country, a sense of Liberty, a Feeling for our Fellow Men, are Ideas that the Brains of Men now a Days can not contemplate: It is a better Way to substitute in the Place of them, The Beauty of a  Lady, the Love of Cards and Horse Races, a Taste in Dress, Musick, and Dancing, The Feeling of a pretty Girl or Fellow and a genteel Delicacy and Complaisance to all who have Power to abuse us. I begin to find that an increasing Affection for a certain Lady, (you know who my Dear) quickens my Affections for every Body Else, that does not deserve my Hatred. A Wonder if the Fires of Patriotism, do not soon begin to burn!  And now I think of it, there is no possible Way of diminishing the Misery of Man kind so effectually as by printing this Letter. It is an intolerable Grievance and Oppression upon poor literary Mortals, to set wasting their Spirits And wearing out that great Gland the Brain, in the study of order and Connection, in  every Part of their Compositions to  [ . . . ]  certain scope. This keeps them besides  [from] the joys of seeing their Productions in Print, several days longer than they is needful, (not nine years indeed, according to those fools the Ancients): We are to our Honor grown a good deal wiser than they. Now I can demonstrate that a Man  write three score Years and ten, after the Model of this Letter, without the least Necessity of Revisal, Emendation or Correction, and all that he should write in that time would be worth Printing too. -- I find the Torrent Hurries me down, but I will make a great Effort to swim ashore to the Name of To the great Goddess   "
Saturday morning Aug. 1763,"My dear  Germantown is at a great Distance from  Weymouth  Meeting-House, you know; The  of Yards indeed is not so prodigious, but the Rowing and Walking that lyes between is a great Discouragement to a weary Traveller. Could my Horse have helped me to  Weymouth,  Braintree would not have held me, last Night. -- I lay, in the well known Chamber, and dreamed, I saw a Lady, tripping it over the Hills, on  Weymouth shore, and Spreading Light and Beauty and Glory, all around her. At first I thought it was Aurora, with her fair Complexion, her Crimson Blushes and her million Charms and Graces. But I soon found it was Diana, a Lady infinitely dearer to me and more charming. -- Should Diana make her Appearance every morning instead of Aurora, I should not sleep as I do, but should be all awake and admiring by four, at latest. -- You may be sure I was mortifyed when I found, I had only been dreaming. The Impression however of this dream awaked me thoroughly, and since I had lost my Diana, I enjoy'd the Opportunity of viewing and admiring Miss Aurora. She's a sweet Girl, upon my Word. Her breath is wholesome as the sweetly blowing Spices of  Arabia, and therefore next to her fairer sister Diana, the Properest Physician,  for your drooping  "
Monday Morning  [15 August?] 1763,"The Disappointment you mention was not intended, but quite accidental. A Gentleman, for whom I had much Esteem, Mr. Daniel Leonard of  Norton, was so good as to offer to keep the sabbath with me at  Braintree -- a  that would have been very agreable if it had not detained me from the most agreable of all Company, to me, in this world, and a favour that will I know be sufficient with you to excuse me. -- A good Nights sleep I have had but not more than I should have had, for a Friend always keeps me awake till Midnight and after. Shall return from  Boston I hope time enough to obey, which I always do with more Pleasure than I ever command.  "
Saturday Evening Eight O'Clock  [7 April 1764],"My dear  For many Years past, I have not felt more serenely than I do this Evening. My Head is clear, and my Heart is at ease. Business of every Kind, I have banished from my Thoughts. My Room is prepared for a Seven Days' Retirement, and my Plan is digested for 4 or 5 Weeks.  retreats with me, to our preparatory Hospital, and is determined to keep me Company, through the Small Pox. Your Unkle, by his agreable Account of the Dr. and your Brother, their Strength, their Spirits, and their happy Prospects, but especially, by the Favour he left me from you, has contributed very much to the Felicity of my present Frame of Mind. For, I assure you Sincerely, that, (as Nothing which I before expected from the Distemper gave me more Concern, than the Thought of a six Weeks Separation from my Diana) my Departure from your House this Morning made an Impression upon me that was severely painfull. I thought I left you, in Tears and Anxiety -- And was very glad to hear by your Letter, that your Fears were abated. For my own Part, I believe no Man ever undertook to prepare himself for the Small Pox, with fewer than I have at present. I have considered thoughrououghly, the Diet and Medicine prescribed me, and am fully satisfyed that no durable Evil can result from Either, and any other Fear from the small Pox or it's Appurtenances, in the modern Way of Inoculation I never had in my Life. -- Thanks for my Balm. Present my Duty and Gratitude to Pappa for his kind offer of Tom. Next Fryday, for certain, with suitable Submission, We take our Departure for  Boston. To Captn. Cunninghams We go -- And I have not the least doubt of a pleasant 3 Weeks, notwithstanding the Distemper. -- Dr. Savil has no Antimony -- So I must beg your Care that John Jenks makes the Pills and sends them by the Bearer. I enclose the Drs. Directions. We shall want about 10 I suppose for my Brother and me. Other Things we have of Savil. Good Night, my Dear, I'm a going to Bed! Sunday Morning 1/2 After 10. The People all gone to Meeting, but my Self, and Companion, who are enjoying a Pipe in great Tranquility, after the operation of our Ipichac. Did you ever see two Persons in one Room Iphichacuana'd together? (I hope I have not Spelled that ineffable Word amiss!) I assure you they make merry Diversion. We took turns to be sick and to laugh. When my Companion was sick I laughed at him, and when I was sick he laughed at me. Once however and once only we were both sick together, and then all Laughter and good  deserted the Room. Upon my Word we both felt very sober. -- But all is now easy and agreable, We have had our Breakfast of Pottage without salt, or Spice or Butter, as the Drs. would have it, and are seated to our Pipes and our Books, as happily as Mortals, preparing for the small Pox, can desire. 5 o clock afternoon. --  has been here and drank Tea with me. His Children are to go with us to Cunninghams. He gives a charming Account of the Dr. and your Brother, whom he saw Yesterday.Billy has two Eruptions for certain, how many more are to come is unknown -- But is as easy and more (the Deacon says) than he ever saw him in his Life. Monday. Ten O'Clock. -- Papa was so kind as to call and leave your Favor of April the Eighth -- For which I heartily thank you. Every Letter I receive from you, as it is an Additional Evidence of your Kindness to me, and as it gives me fresh Spirits and great Pleasure, confers an Additional Obligation upon me. I thank you for your kind and judicious Advice. The  made me the offer Yesterday, which, for the very Reasons you have mentioned, I totally declined. I told you before We had taken our Vomits and last Night We took the Pills you gave me, and we want more. Lent We have kept ever since I left you, as rigidly as two Carmelites. And you may rely upon it, I shall strictly pursue the Drs. Directions, without the least Deviation. Both the Physick and the Abstinence, have hitherto agreed extreamly well with me, for I have not felt freer from all Kinds of Pain and Uneasiness, I have not enjoyed a clearer Head, or a brisker flow of Spirits, these seven Years, than I do this day. My Garden, and My Farm, (if I may call what I have by that Name) give me now and then a little Regret, as I must  leave them in more Disorder than I could wish. But the dear Partner of all my joys and sorrows, in whose Affections, and Friendship I glory, more than in all other Emoluments under Heaven, comes into my Mind very often and makes me sigh. No other Consideration I assure you, has given me, since I began my Preparation, or will give me I believe, till I return from  Boston any Degree of Uneasiness. Papa informs me that Mr. Ayers goes to Town, tomorrow Morning. Will you be so kind as to write the Dr., that I shall come into Town on , that I depend on Dr. Perkins and no other. And that I beg he would write me whether Miss Le Febure can take in my Brother and me in Case of Need. For My Unkle writes me, I must bring a Bed, as his are all engaged, it seems. I have written him, this Moment, that I can not carry one, and that he must procure one for me, or I must look out Elsewhere. I shall have an Answer from him to night and if he cannot get a Bed, I will go to Mrs. Le Febures if she can take us. Should be glad if Tom might be sent over,  Morning. My Love and Duty where owing. Pray continue to write me, by every opportunity, for, next to Conversation, Correspondence, with you is the greatest Pleasure in the World  to yr. PS. My Love to . Thank em for their kind Remembrance of me, and my Blessing to my Daughter Betcy.  "
"Braintree  Ap. 11th. 1764
","My ever dear  The Room which I thought would have been an Hospital or a , has really proved a Den of Thieves, and a scene of Money Changers. More Persons have been with me about Business, since I shut up, than a few, and many more than I was glad to see, for it is a sort of Business that I get nothing by, but Vanity and Vexation of Spirit. If my Imprisonment had been in Consequence of Bankrukpty Bankruptcy, I should not have endured much more Mortification and Disquiet. I wish this Day was a Fast, as well as Tomorrow, that I might be sure of two Days Tranquility, before my Departure. I am not very impatient at present: Yet I wish I was at  Boston. Am somewhat fearful of foul weather, on Fryday. If it should be, the very first fair Opportunity must be embracd. Abstinence from all, but the cool and the soft, has hitherto agreed with me very well; and I have not once transgressed in a single Iota. The Medicine we have taken is far from  being loathsome or painful or troublesome, as I own I expected. And if I could but enjoy my Retreat in silence and solitude, there would be nothing Wanting but Obliviscence of your Ladyship, to make me as Happy as a Monk in a Cloyster or an Hermit in his Cell. You will wonder, perhaps at my calling in Monks and Hermits, on this Occasion, and may doubt about the Happiness of their situations: Yet give me leave to tell you freely, the former of these are so tottally absorbed in Devotion and the latter in Meditation, and such an Appetite, such a Passion for their Respective Employments and Pleasures grows  habi  habitually up in their Minds, that no Mortals, have a better security of happiness (excepting him who hopes to be bound to your Ladyship in the soft Ligaments of Matrimony) have has a better security for Happiness than they. Hitherto I have written with the Air and in the style of Rattle and ; but now I am about to abo shift to the grave and sober the sober and the Grave.-My Mamma  is as easy and composed, and I think much more so than I expected. She sees We  are determined, and that opposition would be not only fruitless, but vexatious, and has therefore brought herself to acquiesce, and to assist in preparing all Things, as convenient conveniently and comfortably as she can. Heaven reward her for her kind Care, and her Labours of Love! I long to come once more to  Weymouth before I go to  Boston. I could, well enough. I am as well as ever, and better too. Why should not I come? Shall I come and keep fast with you? Or will you come and see me? I should be glad to see you in this House, but there is another very near it, where I should rejoice much more to see you, and to live with you till we shall have lived enough to ourselves, to Glory,  [illegible]  Virtue and Mankind, and till both of us shall be desirous of Translation to a wiser, fairer, better World.    I am, and till then, and forever after will be your Admirer and Friend, and Lover,      "
Wednesday Eveng.[11 April 1764],"This is the last Opportunity I shall have to write you from  Braintree   for some Weeks. You may expect to hear from me, as soon after my Arrival at  Boston as possible. Have had a peaceable, pleasant Day upon the whole. My Brother and I have the Wishes, the good Wishes of all the good People who come to the House. They admire our Fortitude, and wish us well thro, even some, who would heartily rejoice to hear that both of Us were dead of the small Pox provided no others could be raised up in our stead to be a Terror to evil Doers, and a Praise  [and] Encouragement to such as they mortally hate, those that do well. But I have attained such an Elevation in  as to be rendered very little, the better or worse, more chearful  or surly, for the good or ill Wishes or Speeches of such Animals, as those. Amusement engages the most of my Attention. I mean that as I am necessitated to spend three or four Weeks in an Absolute Vacation of Business and study, I may not amuse myself, with such silly Trifles as Cards and Baubles altogether, but may make the very Expletives of Time, the very Diverters from Thinking,  while I am under the small Pox of some Use or Pleasure, to me, after  [I] get well. [For this] Purpose beg Papa, to lend me, all the Volumes of Swifts Examiner and send them over by Tom to   yr Love and Duty where, and in Proportion as, it is due.  "
 Thurdsdy. 5. Oclock.  [12 April ] 1764,"Diana I have Thoughts of sending you a Nest of Letters like a nest of ; tho I suspect the latter would be a more genteel and acceptable Present to a Lady. But in my present Circumstances I can much better afford the former than the latter. For, my own Discretion as well as the Prescriptions of the Faculty, prohibit any close Application of Mind to Books or Business-Amusement, Amusement is the only study that I follow. Now Letter-Writing is,  to me, the most agreable Amusement I can find: and Writing to you the most entertaining and Agreable of all Letter-Writing. So that a Nest of an hundred, would cost me Nothing at all. -- What say you my Dear? Are you not much obliged to me, for making you the cheapest of all possible Presents? Shall I continue to write you, so much, and so often after I get to Town? Shall I send you, an History of the whole Voyage? Shall I draw You the Characters of all, who visit me? Shall I describe to you all the Conversations I have? I am   about to make my Appearance on a new Theatre, new to me. I have never been much conversant in scenes, where Drs., Nurses, Watchers, &c. make the Principal Actors. It will be a Curiosity to me. Will it be so to you? I was always pleased to see human  Nature in a Variety of shapes. And if I should be much alone, and feel in tolerable Spirits, it will be a Diversion to commit my Observations to Writing. I believe I could furnish a Cabinet of Letters upon these subjects which would be exceeded in Curiosity, by nothing, but by a  describing the Characters, Diversions, Meals, Wit, Drollery, Jokes, Smutt, and Stories of a Tavern the Guests at a Tavern in  Plymouth where I lodge, when at that Court-which  [illegible]   could be equalled by nothing excepting a minute History of Close stools and Chamber Potts, and of the Operation of Pills, Potions and Powders, in the Preparation for the small Pox. Heaven forgive me for suffering my Imagination to straggle into a Region of Ideas so nauseous And abominable: and suffer me to return to my Project of writing you a journal. You would have a great Variety of Characters -- Lawyers, Physicians ( Divines I believe), a Number of Tradesmen, Country Colonells, Ladies, Girls, Nurses, Watchers, Children, Barbers &c. &c. &c. But among all These, there is but one whose Character I would give much to know better than I do at present. In a Word I am an old Fellow, and have seen so many Characters in my Day, that I am almost weary of Observing them. -- Yet I doubt whether I understand  human Nature or the World very well or not? There is not much Satisfaction in the study of Mankind to a benevolent Mind. It is a new Moon, Nineteen  of it  [illegible]   opaque and unenlightened. Intimacy with the most of People, will bring you acquainted with Vices and Errors, and Follies enough to make you  them. Nay Intimacy with the most celebrated will very much diminish our Reverence and Admiration. What say you now my dear shall I go on with my Design of Writing Characters? -- Answer as you please, there is one Character, that whether I draw it on Paper  or not, I cannot avoid thinking on every Hour, and considering sometimes together and sometimes  [illegible]   asunder, the Excellencies and Defects in it. It is almost the only one that has encreased, for many Years together, in Proportion to Acquaintance and Intimacy, in the Esteem, Love and Admiration of your  "
" [Boston,  13 April 1764]","My dearest We arrived at Captn. Cunninghams, about Twelve O'Clock and sent our Compliments to . The Courrier returned with Answer that the Dr. was determined to inoculate no more without a Preparation preevious to Inoculation. That We should have written to him and have received Directions from him, and Medicine, before We came into Town. I was surprized and chagrined. I wrote, instantly, a Letter to him, and informed him we had been under a Preparation of his prescribing, and that I presumed Dr. Tufts had informed him, that We depended on him, in Preference to any other Gentleman. The Dr. came, immediately with Dr. Warren, in a Chaise -- And after an Apology, for his not Recollecting-(I am obliged to break off my Narration, in order to swallow a Porringer of Hasty Pudding and Milk. I have done my Dinner) -- for not recollecting what Dr. Tufts had told him,Dr. Perkins demanded my left Arm and Dr. Warren my Brothers. They took their Launcetts and with their Points divided the skin for about a Quarter of an Inch and just suffering the Blood to appear, buried a Thread about (half) a Quarter of an Inch long in the   Channell. A little Lint was then laid over the scratch and a Piece of a Ragg pressed on, and then a Bandage bound over all -- my Coat and waistcoat put on, and I was bid to go where I get and do what I pleased. (Dont you think the Dr. has a good Deal of Confidence in my Discretion, thus to leave me to it?) The Doctors have left us Pills red and black to take Night and Morning. But they looked very sagaciously and importantly at us, and ordered my Brother, larger Doses than me, on Account of the Difference in our Constitutions. is a short, thick sett, dark Complexioned, [illegible]   Yet pale Faced, Man, (Pale faced I say, which I was glad to see, because I have a great Regard for a Pale Face, in any Gentleman of Physick, [illegible]   Divinity or Law. It indicates search and study). Gives himself the alert, chearful  Air and  [illegible]  Behaviour of a Physician, not forgeting the solemn, important and wise.Warren is a pretty, tall, Genteel, fair faced young Gentleman. Not quite so much Assurance in his Address, as Perkins, (perhaps because Perkins was present) Yet shewing fully that he knows the Utility thereof, and that he will soon, practice it in full Perfection. The Doctors, having finished the Operation and left Us, their Directions and Medicines, took their Departure in infinite Haste, depend . I have one Request to make, which is that you would be very careful in making Tom, Smoke all the Letters from me, very faithfully, before you, or any of the Family reads them. For,  I shall never fail to smoke them myself before sealing, Yet I fear the Air of this House will be too much infected, soon, to be absolutely without Danger, and I would not you should take the Distemper, by Letter from me, for Millions. I write at a Desk far removed from any sick Room, and shall use all the Care I can, but too much cannot be used. I have written thus far, and it is 45 Minutes Past one O Clock and no more. My Love to all. My hearty Thanks to Mamma for her kind Wishes. My Regards as due to Pappa, and should request his Prayers, which are always becoming, and especially at such Times, when We are undertaking any Thing of Consequence as the small Pox, undoubtedly, , I have not the Least Apprehension att all of what is called Danger.  "
Saturday. Two O Clock  [14 April 1764],"The Deacon and his Three Children are  and the Operation has been performed, and all well. And now our Hospital is full. There are Ten, of Us, under this Roof, now expecting to be sick. One, of Us,Mr. Wheat, begins to complain of a Pain Under his Arm and in his Knees, and about his Back, so that We expect within a few Hours to see the Course of the Eruption and of the fever that  [illegible]   preeceeds and accompanies it. Your Friends,  and Miss Nicholson have been here, and are gone. I delivered your Letters.Arpasia asked me, if you was five feet and six Inches tall? I replyd I had not taken Measure as Yet. You know the Meaning of this Question. She is neither Tall, nor short, neither lean nor fat-pitted with the small Pox -- a fine Bloom. Features somewhat like Esther Quincy's. An Eye, that indicates not only Vivacity, but Fire -- not only Resolution, but Intrepidity. (Scandal protect me, Candor forgive me.) I cannot say that the Kindness, the softness, the Tenderness, that constitutes the Characteristick Excellence of your sex, and for the Want of which no Abilities can atone, are very conspicuous  Either in her Face, Air or Behaviour. Is it not insufferable thus to remark on a Lady whose face I have once only and then but just seen and with whom I have only exchangd two or three Words? Shes a Buxom Lass however, and I own I longed for a Game of Romps with her, and should infallibly have taken one, only I thought the Dress I was in, the Air I had  and especially the Medicine I had taken, would not very greatly please a Lady, a stranger, of much Delicacy. Poll. Palmer and I shall unquestionably go to romping very soon. Perkins, Sprague and Lord, are the Physicians that attend this House. Each has a few Particulars in Point of Diet, in which he differs from the others, and Each has Pills and Powders, different from the others to administer, different at least in size, and shape and . I like my own vastly the best, tho Dr. Lord is really a Man of sense. I fear I must write less than I have done. The Drs. dont approve it. They will allow of nothing  but the Card Table, Chequer Bord, Flute, Violin, and singing, unless, Tittle Tattle, Roll and Tumble, shuttle Cock &c. Pray write as often as you can to   "
Tuesday 17th. April 1764,"Yours of April 15th. this moment received. I thank You for it -- and for your offer of Milk, but We have Milk in vast Abundance, and every Thing else that we want except Company. You cant imagine how finely my Brother and I live. We have, as much Bread and as much new pure Milk, as much Pudding, and Rice, and indeed as much of every Thing of the farinaceous Kind as We please -- and the Medicine We take is not  all nauseous, or painfull. And our Felicity is the   greater, as five Persons in the same Room, under the Care of Lord And Church, are starved and medicamented with the utmost severity. No Bread, No Pudding, No Milk is permitted them, i.e. no pure and simple Milk, (they are allowed a Mixture of Half Milk and Half Water) and every other Day they are tortured with Powders that make them as sick as Death and as weak as Water. All this may be necessary for them for what I know, as Lord is professedly against any Preparation previous to Inoculation.  In which opinion I own I was fully agreed with him, till lately. But Experience has convinced me of my Mistake, and I have felt and now feel every Hour, the Advantage and the Wisdom of the contrary Doctrine.  and your Brother have been here to see Us this Morning. They are charmingly well and chearfull, tho they are lean and weak. Messrs. Quincy's Samuel and Josiah, have the Distemper very lightly. I asked Dr. Perkins how they had it. The Dr.  in the style of the Faculty ""Oh Lord sir; infinitely light!"" It is extreamly pleasing, says he, wherever we go We see every Body passing thro this tremendous Distemper, in the lightest, easiest manner, conceivable. The Dr. meaned, those who have the Distemper by Inoculation in the new Method, for those who have it in the natural Way, are Objects of as much Horror, as ever. There is a poor Man, in this , one Bass, now labouring with it, in the natural Way. He is in a good Way of Recovery, but is  [the ]most shocking sight, that can be  seen. They say he is no more like a Man than he is like an Hog or an Horse -- swelled to three times his size, black as bacon, blind as a stone. I had when I was first inoculated a great Curiosity to go and see him; but the Dr. said I had better not go out, and my Friends thought it would give me a disagreable Turn. My Unkle brought up one Vinal who has just recoverd of it in the natural Way to see Us, and show Us. His face is torn all to Pieces, and is as rugged as  Braintree Commons. This Contrast is forever before the Eyes of the whole Town, Yet it is said there are 500 Persons, who continue to stand it out, in  of Experience and the [illegible]   the Expostulations of the Clergy, both in private and from the Desk, the unwearied Persuasions of the select Men, and the perpetual Clamour and astonishment of the People, and to expose themselves to and From this Distemper in the natural Way! -- Is Man a rational Creature think You? -- Conscience, forsooth and scruples is the are the Cause. -- I should think my self, a deliberate self Murderer, I mean that  I incurred all the Guilt of deliberate self Murther, if I should only stay in this Town and run the Chance of having it in the natural Way. Mr. Wheat is broke out, and is now at the Card Table to  himself. He will not be able to get above a score or two. Badger has been pretty lazy and lolling, and achy about the Head and Knees and Back, for a Day or two, and the Messengers appear upon him, that foretell the compleat Appearance of the Pox in about 24. Hours. Thus We see others, Under the symptoms, and all the Pains that attend the Distemper, under the present Management, every Hour, and are neither dismayed nor in the least disconcerted, or dispirited. But are every one of Us wishing that his Turn might come next, that it might be over, and we about our Business, and I return to my   Farm, my Garden, but above all, to my dearest Diana who Friend is the best of all Friends, And the Richest of all Blessings to her own How shall I express my Gratitude to your Mamma and , for your Kind Care and Concern for me. Am extreamly obliged for the Milk, and the Apples. But would not have you trouble yourselves any more for We have a sufficient, a plentiful supply, of those, and every other good Thing that is permitted Us. Balm is a Commodity in very great Demand and very scarce, here, and there is a great Number of Us to drink of its inspiring Infusion, so that my Unkle, Aunt, and all the Patients under their Roof would be obligd, as well as myself, if you could send me some more. I received Your  Favour by Hannes, this Morning, and had but just finished My Answer to it, when I received the other, by Tom. I never receive a Line from you without a Revivification of Spirits, and a joyful Heart. I long to hear that -- something you  to tell me, in your next. What can that Thing be? thought I. My busy fancy will be speculating and conjecturing about it, night and day, I suppose, till your next Letter shall unriddle the Mystery. You are a wanton, malicious, what shall I call you for putting me in this Puzzle and Teaze for a day or two, when you might have informd me in a Minute. You had best reconsider and retract that bold speech of yours I assure You. For I assure you there is another Character, besides that of , in which, if you never did, you always hereafter shall fear me, or I will know the Reason why. Oh. Now I think  I am determined very soon to write you, an Account in minute Detail of the many Faults I have observed in you. You remember I gave you an Hint that I had observed some, in one of my former Letters. You'l be surprized, when you come to find the Number of them. By the Way I have heard since I came to Town an  Insinuation to your Disadvantage, which I will inform you off, as soon as you have unravelled Your Enigma. We have very litle News, and very little Conversation in Town about any Thing, but the Adulterated Callomel that kill'd a Patient at the Castle, as they say. The Town divides into Parties about it, and Each Party endeavours to throw the Blame, as usual, where his Interest, or Affections, prompt him to wish it might go. Where the Blame will center, or where the  will terminate, I am not able to foresee. The Persons talked of are  Dr. Gelston, Mr. Wm. Greenleaf, the Apothecary who married Sally Quincy, and the  a  Braintree man, who is said to have caried the Druggs from the Apothecary to the Physician. But I think the Serjeant is not much suspected. After all, whether any Body att all is to blame, is with me a dispute. Make my Compliments to all the , give my Duty to all the honourable, and my Love to all the Friendly, whether at  Germantown,  Weymouth or Elsewhere, that enquire after me, and believe me to be with unalterable Affection Yr. 40 minutes after one O.Clock Tuesday April 17th, 1764 "
April 18.  [1764] Wednesday 2 O Clock," Diana Three of our Company, have now the Small Pox upon them, Wheat, Badger, and Elderkin. We have seen them for two or Three days each, wading  Head Acks, Back Acks, Knee Achs, Gagging and Fever, to their present state of an indisputable Eruption, chearful Spirits, coming Appetites and increasing strength. Huntington begins to complain and look languid. -- Our Turn comes next. We have  five days, and entered two Hours on the sixth, since Innoculation, and have as yet felt no Pains, nor Languors from Pox or Medicine, worth mentioning. Indeed what the others have suffered is a mere Trifle. They arise every day with the Rest, having slept as soundly as the rest, eat and drink with the Rest, walk about the Chamber and chat with the rest, excepting that they love lolling and tumbling on the Bed rather more than the rest, and are somewhat less sociable and more frettful, groan a little oftener and wish more to see the Dr. But as soon as the Pock is out, these Pains depart, their Spirits rise, Tongues run, and they eat, drink, laugh and sport like Prisoners released.  wants the Pen and I'm weary of it so I will use it no more than to subscribe the Name of "

","Many have been the particular Reasons against my Writing for several days past, but one general Reason has prevailed with me more than any other Thing, and that was, an Absolute Fear to send a Paper from this House, so much infected as it is, to any Person lyable to take the Distemper but especially to you. I am infected myself, and every Room in the House, has infected People in it, so that there is real Danger, in Writing. However I will write now, and thank you for yours of Yesterday. Mr. Ayers told you the Truth. I was comfortable, and have never been otherwise. I believe, None of the Race of Adam, ever passed the small Pox, with fewer Pains, , Qualms, or with less smart than I have done. I had no Pain in my Back, none in my side, none in my Head. None in my Bones or Limbs, no reching or vomiting or sickness. A short shivering Fit, and a succeeding hot glowing Fit, a Want of Appe- tite, and a general Languor, were all the symptoms that ushered into the World, all the small Pox, that I have can boast of, which are about Eight or Ten, (for I have not yet counted them exactly) two of which only are in my Face, the rest scattered at Random over my Limbs and Body. They fill very finely and regularly, and I am as well, tho not so strong, as ever I was in my Life. My Appetite has returned, and is quick enough and I am returning gradually to my former Method of Living. Very nearly the same may be said of my Brother excepting that, he looks leaner than I, and that he had more sickness and Head  about the Eruption Time of the Eruption than I. Such We have Reason to be thankful has been our Felicity. And that of Deacon Palmers Children has been, nearly the same. But others in the same House have not been so happy -- pretty high Fevers, and severe Pains, and a pretty Plentiful Eruption has been the Portion of Three at last of our Companions.  I join with you sincerely in your Lamentation that you were not inoculated. I wish to God the Dr. would sett up an Hospital at  Germantown, and inoculate you. I will come and nurse you, nay I will go with you to the Castle or to Point Shirley, or any where and attend you. You say rightly safety there is not, and I say, safety there never will be. And Parents must be lost in Avarice or Blindness, who restrain their Children. I believe there will be Efforts to introduce Inoculation at  Germantown, by Drs. Lord and Church. However, be  of taking the Infection unawares. For all the Mountains of  Peru or  Mexico I would not, that this Letter or any other Instrument should convey the Infection to you at unawares.    I hope soon to see you, mean time write as often as possible to , P.S. Dont conclude from any Thing I have written that I think Inoculation a light matter. -- A long and total Abstinence from every Thing in Nature that has any Taste, Two heavy Vomits, one heavy Cathartick, four and twenty Mercurial and Antimonial Pills, and Three Weeks close Confinement to an House, are, according to my Estimation of Things, no small matters. -- However, who would not cheerfully submit to them rather than pass his whole Life in continual Fears, in subjection, under Bondage.   and Myra send Compliments. "
Four O Clock afternoon May 4th. 1764,"Returned from a Ramble in Town which began at 10 in the Morning. Dined with my Friend  and Wm. Checkley, and visited &c. - so that this is the first Moment of my Knowledge of my Letters or the Dr. being in Town. Once I have ridden to Dorchester Meeting House in a Chaise with , another Day, round the Town, and over the Neck in a Chaise with Myra, and Yesterday I rode on Horse back into the Country twelve Miles out and in, with one of my Hospital Companions. -- We are all well but one, who is more hysterical than any ancient Maiden, in the Gout. An History of his Oddities, would be a Curiosity. -- But the Man is in no Danger, his small Pox is all gone, and he can eat  his Pint of Chocolate, and drink his Bowl of Claret sangaree, as well as any Man. I have had a fine Time of it. I drank Frontinac and Mountain Malaga, and eat Oysters in order to make the Pock fill well, till I  up about 30 fine ones. "
"Boston  May 7th. 1764
","I promised you, Sometime agone, a  of your Faults, Imperfections, Defects, or whatever you please to call them. I feel at present, pretty much at Leisure, and in a very suitable Frame of Mind to perform my Promise. But I must caution you, before I proceed to recollect yourself, and instead of being vexed and or fretted or thrown into a Passion, to resolve upon a Reformation-for this is my sincere Aim, in laying before you, this Picture of yourself. In the first Place, then, give me leave to  say, you have been extreamly negligent, in attending so little to Cards. You have very litle Inclination, to that noble and elegant Diversion, and whenever you have taken an Hand you have held it but aukwardly and played it, with a very uncourtly, and indifferent, Air. -- Now I have Confidence enough in your good sense, to rely upon it, you will for the future endeavour to make a better Figure in this elegant and necessary Accomplishment. Another Thing, which ought to be mentioned, and by all means amended, is, the Effect of a Country Life and Education, I mean, a certain Modesty, sensibility, Bashfulness, call it by which of these Names you will, that enkindles Blushes forsooth  at every Violation of Decency, in Company, and lays a most insupportable Constraint on the freedom of Behaviour. Thanks to the late Refinements of modern manners, Hypocrisy, superstition, and Formality have lost all Reputation in the World and the utmost sublimation of Politeness and Gentility lies, in Ease, and Freedom, or in other Words in a natural Air and Behaviour, and in expressing a satisfaction at whatever is suggested and prompted by Nature, which the aforesaid Violations of Decency, most certainly are. In the Third Place, you could never yet be  on to learn to sing. This I take very soberly to be an Imperfection of the most moment of any. An Ear and a for Musick would be a source of much Pleasure, and a Voice and skill, would be a private solitary Amusement, of great Value when no other could be had. You must have remarked an Example of this in Mrs. Cranch, who must in all probability have been deafened to Death with the Cries of her Betcy, if she had not drowned them in  [illegible]  Musick of her own. In the Fourth Place you very often hang your Head like a Bulrush. You do not sit, erected as you ought, by which Means, it happens that you appear too  short for a Beauty, and the Company looses the sweet smiles of that Countenance and the bright sparkles of those Eyes. - This Fault is the Effect and Consequence of another, still more inexcusable in a Lady. I mean an Habit of Reading, Writing and Thinking. -- But both the Cause and the Effect ought to be repented and amended as soon as possible. Another Fault, which seems to have been obstinately persisted in, after frequent Remonstrances, Advices and Admonitions of your Friends, is that of sitting with the  across. This ruins the figure and the Air, this injures the Health. -- And springs I fear from the former source vizt. too much Thinking. -- These Things ought not to be! A sixth Imperfection is that of Walking, with the Toes bending inward. This Imperfection is commonly called Parrot-toed, I think, I know not for what Reason. But it gives an Idea, the reverse of a bold and noble Air,  the Reverse of the stately strutt, and the sublime Deportment. -- Thus have I given a faithful Portraiture of all the , I have hitherto discerned in this Luminary.  Have not regarded  [illegible]   Order, but have painted them as they arose in my Memory. Near Three Weeks have I  [illegible]   conned and studied for more, but more are not to be discovered. All the rest is bright and luminous. -- Having finished the Picture I finish my Letter, lest while I am recounting Faults, I should commit the greatest  in a Letter, that of tedious and excessive Length. There's a prettily turned Conclusion for You! from yr. "
"May 8th, 1764 "," Diana This Morning received yours by Mr. Ayers. I can say nothing to the Contents at present, being obliged to employ all my Time in preparing for  Braintree. I write only to thank you, and let you know I come home Tomorrow. -- But when I shall see Diana, is uncertain. -- In the Warfare between Inclination and Prudence, I believe Prudence must prevail, especially as that Virtue will in this Case be seconded by the sincerest of all Affections, that of  for Diana. "
 [September - October 1764?],"If I had Time I would write have been to  Taunton,  Norton &c. and came home in very fine dry weather and was in very good Health all the Journey. -- Went to  Germantown  last and was very happy in finding your Lady Ship, and after that Pleasure was over was extream miserable in the Country of Cranch his wife &c. And here I am at present in a different Health, and very abaundantly averse to a Journey to:  Weymouth "
Septr. 30th. 1764 ,"My dear  I have this Evening been to see the Girl. -- What Girl? Pray, what Right have you to go after Girls? -- Why, my Dear, the Girl I mentioned to you, Miss Alice Brackett. But Miss has hitherto acted in the Character of an House-Keeper, and her noble aspiring Spirit had rather rise to be a Wife than descend to be a Maid. To be serious, however, she says her Uncle, whose House she keeps cannot possibly spare her, these two Months, if then, and she has no Thoughts of leaving him till the Spring, when she intends for  Boston to become a Mantua Maker. So that We are still to seek. Girls enough from fourteen to four and Twenty, are mentioned to me, but the Character of every Mothers Daughter of them is as yet problematical to me. Hannah Crane (pray dont you want to have her, my Dear) has sent several Messages to my Mother, that she will  live with you as cheap, as any Girl in the Country. She is stout and able and for what I know willing, but I fear not honest, for which Reason I presume you will think of her no more. Another Girl, one Rachael Marsh, has been recommended to me as a clever Girl, and a neat one, and one that wants a Place. She was bred in the Family of one of our substantial Farmers and it is likely understands Country Business, But whether she would answer your Purposes, so well as another, I am somewhat in Doubt. I have heard of a Number of younger Girls of Fourteen and thereabout, but these I suppose you would not choose. It must therefore be left with you to make , and determine for yourself. If you could hear of a suitable Person at   Mistick or  Newtown, on many Accounts she would be preferable to one, nearer home. So much for Maids -- now for the Man. I shall leave orders for Brackett, to go to Town, Wednesday or  with an Horse Cart. You will get ready by that Time and ship aboard, as many Things as you think proper. It happens very unfortunately that my Business calls me away at this Juncture for two Weeks together, so that I can take no Care at all about Help or Furniture or any Thing else. But Necessity has no Law. Tomorrow Morning I embark for  Plymouth -- with a (fowl) disordered stomach, a pale Face, an Aching Head and an Anxious Heart. And What Company shall I find there? Why a Number of  Lawyers, drunken Squires, and impertinent and stingy Clients. If you realize this, my Dear, since you have agreed to run fortunes with me, you will submit with less Reluctance to any little Disappointments and Anxieties you may meet in the Conduct of your own Affairs. I have a great Mind to keep a Register of all the stories, Squibbs, Gibes, and Compliments, I shall hear  the whole Week. If I should I could entertain you with as much Wit, Humour, smut, Filth, Delicacy, Modesty and Decency, tho not with so exact Mimickry, as a certain Gentleman did the other Evening. Do you wonder, my Dear, why that Gentleman does not succeed in Business, when his whole study and Attention has so manifestly been engaged in the nobler Arts of smutt, Double Ententre, and Mimickry of Dutchmen and Negroes? I have heard that Imitators, tho they imitate well, Master Pieces in elegant and valuable Arts, are a servile Cattle. And that Mimicks are the lowest Species of Imitators, and I should think that Mimicks of Dutchmen and Negroes were the most sordid of Mimicks. If so, to what a Depth of the Profound have we  plunged that Gentlemans Character. Pardon me, my dear, you know that Candour is my Characteristick-as it is undoubtedly of all the Ladies who are entertained with that Gents Conversation. Oh my dear Girl, I thank Heaven that another Fortnight will restore you to me -- after so long a separation. My soul and Body have both been thrown into Disorder, by your Absence, and a Month of two more would make me the most insufferable , in the World. I see nothing but Faults, Follies, Frailties and Defects in any Body, lately. People have lost all their good Properties or I my justice, or Discernment. But you who have always softened and warmed my Heart, shall restore my Benevolence as well as my Health and Tranquility of mind. You shall polish and refine my sentiments of Life and Manners, banish all the unsocial and ill natured Particles in my Composition, and form me to that happy Temper, that can reconcile a quick Discernment with a perfect . Believe me, now & ever  faithful  P.S. My Duty to my worthy Aunt. Oh! I forget myself. My  Imagination has rap'd me into future Times. I mean, make my Compliments to Mrs. Smith. And tell Betcy I wont expose her Midnight Walks to her Mamma, if she will be a good Girl.  Since the enclosed was written my Mother has informed me, that Molly Nash and her Mother too asked her to get a Place for Molly with me. She is a pretty, neat; Girl, and I believe has been well bred. Her Mother is a very clever Woman. The Girl is about 17. But my Mother says that Judah will do very well for your service this Winter. She is able to do a good deal of Business. And my mother farther says that she shall have no Occasion for her this Winter and that you may take her if you please and return her in the Spring, when it is likely she will have Occasion again for some Help and you will it is likely want some better Help. This last Project is the most saving one. And Parcimony is a virtue that you and I must study. However I will submit to any , for your Ease and Conveniency that I can possibly afford. All these Things I mention to you, that you may weigh  I shall acquiesce with Pleasure in your D  [eterminat] ion. "

Mr.                     Langdon, who is to be the Bearer, was so good as to call this Morning,                     to know if I had any Letters to send.  therefore                     of Course, treat him civilly and give him Thanks. We are now but beginning the                     Business of Falmouth Court. The Weather has been for three days,                     so hot, as to render the Business of the Court very irksome, indeed, but we are                     in hopes it will now be cooler. How long I shall be obliged to stay here, I cant                     say. But you may depend I shall stay here no longer, than absolute Necessity                     requires. Nothing but the Hope of acquiring some little Matter for my dear                     Family, could carry me, thro these tedious                     Excursions. -- How my Business at home may suffer I cant tell. -- I hope to be                     in Boston before July Ct                              [Court]. If I should not, you will see that my                     Actions are entered. -- Give my Love to my little Babes. Cant you contrive to go                     to Braintree to kiss my little Suky, for me.

There are about 60 or 70 Actions now remaining on the Dockett, and When we shall get loose from this Town I cant yet foresee. However, I am determined not to stay at York Court and therefore shall be at home, the latter End of the Week after next. If I can be at home sooner I shall. I hope you are all well.

","My Dear There is no Business here - And I presume as little at  Braintree. The Pause in the English Trade, has made Husbandmen and Manufacturers, and increased Industry and Frugality, and thereby diminished the Number of Debts and Debtors, and Suits and Suiters. But the hourly Arrival of Ships from  England deeply loaden with dry Goods, and the extravagant Credit that is  given to Country Traders, opens a Prospect very melancholly to the public, tho profitable to Us, of a speedy revival of the suing Spirit. At present I feel very easy and comfortable, at Leisure to read, and think. I hope all are well, shall come up tomorrow after noon, if Mr. Austin comes down in the Morning.    "

There are now signs of a gathering Storm, so I shall make  easy here for the Sabbath. I wish myself at  Braintree. This wandering, itinerating Life grows more and more disagreable to me. I want to see my Wife and Children every Day, I want to see my Grass and Blossoms and Corn, &c. every Day. I want to see my Workmen, nay I almost want to go and see the Bosse Calfs's almost  as often as Charles does. But above all except the Wife and Children I want to see my Books. None of these Amusements are to be had. The Company we have is not  to me. In Coll. Warren and his Lady I find Friends, Mr. Angier is very good, but farther than these, I have very little Pleasure in Conversation. Dont expect me, before Saturday.- Perhaps Mrs. Hutchinson may call upon you, in her Return to  Boston, the later End of next Week or beginning of the Week after. Pray let the People take Care of the Caterpillars. Let them go over and over, all the Trees, till there is not the appearance of a nest, or Worm left.  "
 Feby. 24. 1774,"My Dear I was very glad to receive a Line from you, by Mr. French,  the Account you give me of the Danger of my dear Mother gives me great Concern.

","My Dear I am  afflicted with the Relation your Father gave me, of the Return of your Disorder. I fear you have taken some Cold; We have had a most pernicious Air, a great Part of this Spring. I am sure I have Reason to remember it -- my Cold is the most obstinate and threatning  one, I ever had in my Life: However, I am unwearied in my Endeavours to subdue it, and have the Pleasure to think I have had some Success. I rise at 5, walk 3 Miles, keep the Air all day and walk again in the Afternoon. These Walks have done me more good than any Thing, tho I have been constantly plied with Teas, and your Specific. My own Infirmities, the Account of the Return of yours, and the public News coming Altogether have put my Utmost Phylosophy  to the Tryal. We live my dear Soul, in an Age of . What will be the Consequence I know not. The Town of  Boston, for ought I can see, must suffer Martyrdom: It must expire: And our principal Consolation is, that it dies in a noble Cause. The Cause of Truth, of Virtue, of Liberty and of Humanity: and that it will probably have a glorious Reformation, to greater Wealth, Splendor and Power than ever.   Let me know what is best for us to do. It is expensive keeping a Family here. And there is no Prospect of any Business in my Way in this Town this whole Summer. I dont receive a shilling a Week. We must contrive as many Ways as we can, to save , for We may have Calls to contribute, very largely in Proportion to our Circumstances, to prevent other very honest, worthy People from suffering for Want, besides our own Loss in Point of Business and Profit. Dont imagine from all this that I am in the Dumps. Far otherwise. I can truly say, that I have felt more Spirits and Activity, since the Arrival of this News, than I had done before for years. I look upon this, as the last Effort of Lord Norths Despair. And he will as surely be defeated in it, as he was in the Project of the Tea. --  I am, with great Anxiety for your Health your  "

I send with this an whole  of Letters, which are upon a Subject of great Importance, and therefore must intreat the earliest Conveyance of them. There is but little Business here, and whether there will be more at  York  or  Falmouth is uncertain, but I must take the Chance of them. My Time, in these tedious Peregrinations, hangs heavily upon me. One half of it is always spent without Business, or Pleasure, or Diversion, or Books or Conversation. My Fancy and Wishes and Desires, are at  Braintree, among my Fields, Pastures and Meadows, as much as those of the Israelites were among the Leeks, Garleeks and Onions of the Land of Goshen. My Sons and  too are missing, as well as their Mother, and I find nothing in any of my Rambles to supply their Place. We have had a vast Abundance of Rain here this Week and hope you have had a Sufficiency with you. But the Plenty of it, will render the Making of Hay the more critical, and you must exhort Bracket to be vigilant, and not let any of the Grass suffer, if he can help it. I wish you would converse with Brackett, and Mr. Hayden and Mr. Belcher about a proper Time to get me a few freights of Marsh Mud, , or Creek Mudd. I must have some If I pay the Cash for getting it, at almost any Price. But I wont be answerable again to Deacon Palmer, for the Schough. Whoever undertakes, shall hire that, and I will be chargeable to no Man but the Undertaker, and Labourers. I want a freight or two, soon, that it may be laid by the wall and mixed with Dust and Dung that it may ferment and mix as soon as may be, now the hot Weather is coming on.

"York  June 29 1774
","My  The Prophet of  York has not  in vain. There is in this Town and County a Laodiceanism that I have not found in any other Place. I find more Persons here, who call the Destruction of the Tea, Mischief and Wickedness, than any where else. More Persons who say that the Duty upon Tea is not a Tax, nor an Imposition because we are at Liberty to use it or not, than any where else. I am told that the Deacon insinuates Sentiments and Principles into the People here in a very subtle manner, a manner so plausible that they scarcely know how they come by them. When I got to the Tavern, on the Eastern Side of  Piscataqua River, I found the Sherriff of  York, and Six of his Deputies all with gold laced , Ruffles, Swords, and very gay Cloaths, and all likely young Men, who had come out to that Place 10 miles to escort the Court into Town. This unusual Parade excited my Curiosity, and I soon suspected that this was to shew Respect and be a Guard to the Chief justice if he had been coming to Court. The Foreman of the Grand jury, told judge Trowbridge, that if the  had been here, not a Man of their jury would have refused to be sworn. However, I have been told by others that the Foreman is mistaken. That it was universally known he was not at  Ipswich and would not be here. But if he had been here, there would have been a Difficulty. There is an uncommon Subject of Conversation here at present -- a general Report of some pernicious Quality in Clams, at this Season. It is said that two only, of a particular Sort of large Clams, were given to a Dog a few Days since and that he died in less than two Hours. His Master however, would not be  by his Wife from eating 12 or 13 of the same Sort of Clams the next Day, and he was soon seized with a Numbness, and died before the Doctor could be brought to his Relief. A whole Family it is said at a neighbouring Town, were taken in the same manner after eating Clams, but happening to be advised in Season by Somebody to take Something which operated like an Emetic their Lives were saved, but their Health much impaired. There is also a Report well authenticated from Ipswich, that a Person at Ipswich died in the same manner, and on the same day, with the Man at  York, after Eating the same kind of shell fish. There is a vulgar Saying, that  are unwholsome in every Month of the Year, which has not an R. in it. This common Sentiment receives much Credit, from the Facts here related. We are told from  Portsmouth, , that the Vigilance and Activity of the People there have put the Tea on shipboard again to be sent abroad, to  Nova Scotia.  "
"York   June 29. 1774
","This is the second day of the Term at  York: very little Business -- very hot weather. My Refreshment is a flight to  B.  to my Corn fields and Grass Plotts, my Gardens and Meadows. My Fancy runs about you perpetually. It is continually with you and in the Neighbourhood of you -- frequently takes a Walk with you, and your little prattling, Nabby, Johnny, Charly, and Tommy. We walk all together up  Penn's Hill, over the Bridge to the Plain, down to the Garden, &c. We had a curious Dialogue Yesterday, at Dinner, between our J-s T-w-e  [Trowbridge] and H-n  [Hutchinson]. T. said he had seen a Letter, from  England, in which it was said that the Conduct of the Chief Justice was highly approved, and that of the other judges highly disapproved, at the Court End of the Town. -- T. added, I dont know whether they impute it all to me or not. -- Aye, says H. [Hutchinson] but it was all owing to you. You laid Brother R.  [Ropes], C.  [Cushing] and me, under the Necessity of refusing the Royal Grant, and accepting the Province Salary. T.  said he was of the Mind of a Man he named, who was once in the Streets of  Madrid, when the Host was carried along. He was bid to kneel, refused, and was instantly knocked down. Some time after he met the Host again and then he kneeled down, instantly, and said he would never be knocked down again, for not Kneeling to the Host. T.  said to H.  [Hutchinson] did not you say to me, you would take the Province Salary? -- No says H. I never said a Word to you about it. Justice Ropes and I agreed to take the Royal Grant. T.  Why did not you refuse to declare? -- H. [Hutchinson] Because you had led the Way, and I lived in  Boston; if I had lived in  Cambridge, or any where else, I should have had no Notion of being compell'd into any Thing against my Inclination. T.  Brother C.  [Cushing] sent the most curious Letter. Instead of declaring what he had done or would do, he declared what he could do. When I say H. said that was according to the Spirit of his Ancestors. -- T. said when I saw that, I said, it proved his Legitimacy. There was a very large numerous Company present at this Conversation, and seemed astonished, and confounded at this Weakness, and Want of Decency, Prudence, Caution and Dignity of these great Men. After Dinner Justice Gowen  said that H. put him in Mind of a Man, who took the Money Oath, after having frequently taken  New Hampshire Bills. Somebody expressed his Surprize. Yes says the Man, I have often taken Paper Money, but never Wittingly and Willingly, for I had much rather have taken Silver. I never took a Paper Bill in my Life, but I had much rather have taken Gold, Silver or even Copper. My Dear, when I shall see you I know not, but I design to write by every opportunity. Pray remember my Marsh .   "
"York  June 29, 1774
","My Dear I have a great Deal of Leisure, which I chiefly employ in Scribbling, that my Mind may not stand still or run back like my Fortune. -- There is very little Business here, and David Sewall, David Wyer, John Sullivan and James Sullivan and Theophilus Bradbury are the Lawyers who attend the  Courts and consequently conduct the Causes at the Superiour. I find that the Country is the Situation to make Estates by the Law. John Sullivan, who is placed at  Durham in New Hampshire, is younger, both in Years and Practice than I am; He began with nothing, but is now said to be worth Ten thousand Pounds  Money, his Brother James allows five or six or perhaps seven thousand Pounds, consisting in Houses and Lands, Notes, Bonds, and Mortgages. He has a fine Stream of Water, with an excellent Corn Mill, Saw Mill, Fulling Mill, Scyth Mill and others, in all six Mills, which are both his Delight and his Profit. As he has earned Cash in his Business at the Bar, he has taken Opportunities, to purchase Farms of his Neighbours, who wanted to sell and move out farther into the Woods, at an Advantageous Rate. And in this Way, has been growing rich, and under the Smiles and Auspices of Governor Wentworth, has been promoted in the civil and military Way, so that he is treated with great Respect in this Neighbourhood. James Sullivan, Brother of the other, who studied Law under him, without any  Education, as his (and John was in the same Case,) is fixed at  Saco, alias  Biddeford in our Province. He began with neither Learning, Books, Estate or any Thing, but his Head and Hands, and is now a very popular Lawyer and growing rich very fast, purchasing great Farms &c., a Justice of the Peace, and Member of the General Court. David Sewall of this Town never practices out of this County, has no Children,  has no Ambition, nor Avarice they say, (however Quaere). His Business in this County maintains him very handsomely, and he gets beforehand.  at  Falmouth, they say, grows rich very fast. I was first sworn in 1758; My Life has been a continual  of Fatigue, Vexation, Labour and Anxiety. I have four children. But I had a pretty Estate from my Father, I have been assisted by your Father. I have done the greatest Business in the Province. I have had the very richest Clients in the Province: Yet I am Poor in Comparison of others. This I confess is grievous, and discouraging. I ought however, to be candid enough to acknowledge that I have been imprudent. I have spent an Estate in Books. I have spent a Sum of Money indiscreetly in  a Lighter, another in a Pew, and a much greater in an House in  Boston. These would have been Indiscretions, if the Impeachment of the Judges, the Boston Port Bill, &c. &c. had never happened; but by the unfortunate Interruption of my Business from these Causes, these Indiscretions become almost fatal to me, to be sure much more detrimental. John Lowell, at  , has built him an House, like the Palace of a Nobleman and lives in great Splendor. His Business is very profitable. In short every Lawyer who  [has ] the least Appearance of Abilities makes it do in the  [Country]. In Town, nobody does, or ever can, who Either is not obstinately determined never to have any Connection with Politicks or does not engage on the Side of the Government, the Administration and the Court. Let us therefore my dear Partner, from that Affection which we feel for our lovely Babes, apply ourselves by every Way, we can, to the Cultivation of our Farm. Let Frugality, And Industry, be our Virtues, if they are not of any others. And above all Cares of this Life let our ardent Anxiety be, to  the Minds and Manners of our Children. Let us teach them not only to do virtuously but to excell. To excell they must be taught to be steady, active, and industrious.   "
"York  June 30th, 1774
","My  I have nothing to do here, but to take the Air,  for News, talk Politicks and write Letters. This Town has the best Air I ever breathed. It is very level and there are no Mountains or Hills to obstruct the free Course of the Air, upon any Point of Compass for 8 or 10 Miles. It lies upon the Sea on the  south And on a has a River running through it. The Weather has been inexpressibly fine all this Week. The Air is as clear, as bright, as springy, as you can conceive.  Braintree Air is thick and unelastic in Comparison of this. What then is that of  Boston? I regret that I cannot have the Pleasure of enjoying this fine Weather, with my Family, and upon my farm. -- Oh, how often am I there! I have but a dull Prospect before me. I have no hope of reaching  Braintree, under a Fortnight from this Day, if I should in twenty days. I regret my Absence from the  County of Suffolk this Week on another Account. If I was there I could converse with the Gentlemen, who are bound with me for  Phyladelphia. I could turn the Course of my Reading and Studies to such subjects of Law and  and Commerce as may come, in Play, at the Congress. I might be furbishing up my old Reading in Law and History, that I might appear with  less Indecency before a Variety of Gentlemen, whose Educations, Travel, Experience, Family, Fortune, and every Thing will give them a vast Superiority to me, and I fear to some of my Companions. This  Town of York is a Curiosity, in several Views. The People here are great Idolaters of the Memory of their former . Deacon Sayward says, and the rest of them generally think, that Mr. Moody was one of the greatest Men and best Saints, who have lived since the Days of the Apostles. He had an Ascendency, an Authority over the People here as absolute, as that of any Prince in Europe not excepting his Holiness. This he acquired by a Variety of Means. In the first Place he settled  in the Place without any Contract. His professed Principle was that no Man should be hired to preach the Gospell, but that the Minister should depend upon the Charity, Generosity, and Benevolence of the People. This was very flattering to their Pride. And left Room for their Ambition to display itself, in an Emulation among them, which should be most bountifull and ministerial. In the next Place, he acquired the Character of firm Trust in Providence. A Number of Gentlemen came in one day, when they had nothing in the House. His Wife was very anxious, they  say, and asked him what they should do?  ""Oh, never fear, trust Providence, make a fire in the oven, and you will have something."" Very soon a Variety of every Thing that was good was sent in, and by one O Clock they had a Splendid Dinner. He had also the Reputation of enjoying intimate Communication with the Deity, and of having a great Interest in the Court of Heaven by his Prayers. He always kept his  in order and was fond of Shooting. On a Time, they say, he was out of Provisions. There came along two wild Geese. He takes Gun and crys if it please God I kill both, I will send the fattest to the poorest Person in this Parish. He shot and kill'd both, ordered them, plucked, and then sent the fattest to a poor Widow, leaving the other  [which] was a very poor one at home, to the great Mortification of his Lady. But his Maxim was perform unto the Lord thy Vow. But the best Story I have heard Yet, was his Doctrine in a Sermon from this Text -- Lord what shall We do? The Doctrine was, That when a Person or People are  in a state of Perplexity, and know not what to do, they ought never to do they know not what? This is applicable to the Times. He brought his People into a remarkable Submission and Subjection to their Spiritual Rulers, which continues to this Day. Lyman their present Parson, does and says as he pleases, is a great Tory and as odd as Moody.   "
"York  June 30. 1774
","My . I have had a Curiosity to examine what could have been the Cause of   Affection to the Tories. I find that in some former Years, while Hutchinson was Chief Justice, that Arch Corrupter and Deceiver lodged at the House of Dr. Lyman the Parson's Brother, and professed great Friendship for him as well as the Parson, made the Doctor a Justice of the Peace &c. The Office of a Justice of the Peace, is a great Acquisition in the Country, and such a Distinction to a Man among his  as is enough to purchase and corrupt allmost any Man. This laid an early Foundation in the Minister and the Dr. Add to this, the continual Correspondence between Hutchinson and Sayward, the Rescinder and Lymans Deacon. Add also David Sewalls Assistance with whom Hutchinson afterwards boarded, and all when he was of the Court, and all the rest of the Judges ever since. Add also the Influence of the Moulton Family, one of whom is sherriff, and others are in office. In Truth the offices, which are held in every Shire Town of every County, create a Dependence in the Minds of the Principal Gentlemen of the Place upon the Court, which generally draws the Parson and often the Doctor into the Vortex, untill they all become disposed to Act upon the Principle of Coll. Chandler at  Worcester, tho they have generally more policy than to avow it  ""That if the Devil was Governor, as for them and their Houses they would be Governors Men."" Thus much for : Now for private Affairs. I spent the last Evening at Paul Dudley Woodbridges, a Tavern, with  Farnham of Newbury Port, Major Sullivan, Jemmy Sullivan and David Wyer. Farnham it seems was born in this  Town of York and he gave us an Account of an Affair which happened when he was a Boy. Governor Belcher, who,  he was Bone of our Bone, and Flesh of our Flesh and Blood of our Blood, was the most arbitrary Governor, the Province ever had, sent down a Letter to the Judges of the Court of Common Pleas and General Sessions of the Peace, to appoint one Frost, (a Relation of Mr. afterwards General Pepperell, at whose Request it was supposed the Mandate issued) to be Clerk of those Courts in the Room of one Hammond. Hammond was a good officer, and the Courts would not displace him. Belcher, upon receiving Information of this Resolution of the Judges and Justices, without Ceremony displaced them, and appointed others who were obsequious enough to make his Clerk. Now let me wander to my Family. I am very  and anxious about our Johnny. What School to send him to -- what Measures to take with him. He must go on learning his Latin, to his Grandfather or to you, or somewhere. And he must write. You must take Care my Dear, to get as much Work out of our Tenants as possible. Belcher is in Arrears. He must work. Hayden must work. Harry Field must work, and Jo. Curtis too must be made to settle. He owes something. Jo. Tirrell too, must do something -- and Isaac. I cant loose such Sums as they owe me -- and I will not. I shall not get enough at  York Court to pay my  for the Week, and in short, I feel as if my Business was at an End. If I understood any other I would betake myself to it. The Utmost Parcimony and even Penury is necessary, for me to avoid running behind hand.   "
"York  July 1st: 1774
","I am so idle, that I have not an easy Moment, without my Pen in my Hand. My Time might have been improved to some Purpose, in mowing Grass, raking Hay, or hoeing Corn, weeding , picking or shelling Peas. Much better should I have been employed in schooling my Children, in teaching them to write, cypher, Latin, French, English and Greek. I sometimes think I must come to this -- to be the Foreman upon my own Farm, and the School Master to my own Children. I confess myself to be full of Fears that the Ministry and their Friends and Instruments, will prevail, and crush the Cause and Friends of Liberty. The Minds of that Party are so filled with Prejudices, against me, that they will take all Advantages, and do me all the Damage they can. These Thoughts have their Turns in my Mind, but in general my Hopes are predominant. In a  of a Cause here to Day, some Facts were mentioned, which are worth writing to you. It was sworn, by Dr. Lyman, Elder Bradbury and others, that there had been a Number of Instances in this Town of fatal Accidents, happening from sudden Noises striking the Ears of Babes and young Children. A Gun was fired near one Child, as likely as any; the Child fell immediately into fits, which impaired his Reason, and is still living an Ideot. Another Child was sitting on a Chamber floor. A Man rapped suddenly and violently on the Boards which made the floor under the Child  [tremble]. The Child was so startled, and frightened, that it fell into fits, which never was were cured. This may suggest a Caution to keep Children from sudden Frights and . Dr. Gardiner arrived here , from  Boston, brings us News of an Engagement a Battle at the Town Meeting, between Whigs and Tories, in which the Whiggs after a Day and an Halfs obstinate Engagement were finally victorious by two to one. He says the Tories are preparing a flaming Protest. I am determined to be cool, if I can; I have suffered such Torments in my Mind, heretofore, as have almost overpowered my Constitution, without any Advantage: and now I will laugh and be easy if I can, let the Conflict of Parties, terminate as it will -- let my own Estate and Interest suffer what it will. Nay whether I stand high or low in the Estimation of the World, so long as I keep a Conscience void of  towards God and Man. And thus I am determined by the Will of God, to do, let what will become of me or mine, my Country, or the World. I shall arouse myself ere long I believe, and exert an Industry, a Frugality, a hard , that will serve my family, if I cant serve my Country. I will not lie down and die in Dispair. If I cannot serve my Children by the Law, I will serve them by Agriculture, by Trade, by some Way, or other. I thank God I have a Head, an Heart and Hands which altogether if once fully exerted alltogether, will succeed in the World as well as those of the mean spirited, low minded, fawning obsequious scoundrells who have long hoped, that I should my Integrity would be  an Obstacle in my Way, and enable them to out strip me in the Race. But what I want in Comparison of them, of  and servility, I will make up in Industry and Capacity. If I dont they shall laugh and triumph. I will not  willingly see Blockheads, whom I have a Right to despise, elevated above me, and insolently triumphing over me. Nor shall Knavery, through any Negligence of mine, get the better of Honesty, nor Ignorance of Knowledge, nor Folly of Wisdom, nor Vice of Virtue. I must  you, my dear Partner in all the joys and Sorrows, Prosperity and Adversity of my Life, to take a Part with me in the Struggle. I pray God for your Health -- intreat you to rouse your whole Attention to the Family, the stock, the Farm, the Dairy. Let every Article of Expence which can possibly be spared be retrench'd. Keep the Hands attentive to their Business, and  [let] the most prudent Measures of every kind be adopted and pursued with Alacrity and Spirit.   "
"York  July 2, 1774
","My  I have concluded, to mount my Horse, tomorrow Morning at four, and ride to  Wells to hear my old worthy learned ingenious Friend , whom I never was yet so happy as to hear. Mr. Winthrop agrees to be my Company.  Wells is about 15 Miles from this Place: from thence we propose to ride after the Evening Service is over, to  Saco, i.e.  Biddeford, which is about 30 Miles from hence, which will leave us an easy journey to  Falmouth for Monday. Mr. Winthrop tells me, that he has heard the late Governor Hutchinson, while he was Chief Justice, frequently say for seven Years together, that  Salem was the most proper, convenient, and suitable Place in the Province for the Seat of Government: That he frequently complimented the Gentlemen of  Salem, with the Happiness and Convenience of their Situation, for the Seat of Government, and with his Prophecies, that it would certainly be made such, in a Course of Years. I mentioned this to the  Judge Trowbridge, and he told me that  he himself remembered to have heard him say the same Thing. -- I am very much mistaken if I have not heard him say so too. And I remember, I happened to be with Kent when he carried to Judge Lynde his Commission as Chief Justice. And Judge Lynde entertained me for some Time, with Conversation about making  Salem the Seat of Government, and with the probable Effects of such a Measure one of which he said would be the Translation of a great Part of the Trade from  Boston to  Salem. But he said he did not want to have Troops in  Salem. Now let any one, who knows these Anecdotes judge,  who was the Suggester, Planner, and Promoter of this wrong headed, and iniquitous Measure. Safford my Barber, tells me, that his Minister Lyman is bribed to be a Tory. He says that whenever Deacon Sayward has a  arrive, he sends the Parson, 10 Gallons of Rum, 2 or 300 of Sugar, 10 Gallons of Wine, a Barrel of Flour &c. &c. &c. He says  ""he thinks that all Toryism grows out of Bribery."" I thought the Barbers Observation as just and as memorable as Parson Moodys Doctrine  ""that when Men knew  not what to do, they ought not to do they knew not what."" I write you this Tittle Tatle, my Dear, in Confidence. You must keep these Letters chiefly to yourself, and communicate them with great Caution and Reserve. I should advise you to put them up safe, and preserve them. They may exhibit to our Posterity a kind of Picture of the Manners, Opinions, and Principles of these Times of Perplexity, Danger and Distress. Deacon Sayward said at Table this Week in my Hearing that there was but one Point in which he differed, in Opinion from the late Governor Hutchinson and that was with Regard to the Reality of Witchcraft, and the Existence of Witches. The Governor he said would not allow there was any such Thing. The Deacon said he was loath to differ from him in any Thing. He had so great a Regard for him, and his opinions that he was willing to give up almost every Thing, rather than differ with him, but in this he could not see with him. Such is the Cant of this artfull, selfish, hypocritical Man. Pray remember  my dear little Babes, whom I long to see running to meet me and climb up upon me, under the Smiles of their Mother.   "
"Littlefields at Wells.  July 3. 1774
","My Dear Mr. Winthrop, Mr. Quincy and I came this Morning from  York, before Breakfast, 15 Miles, in order to hear my learned Friend Hemmenway. Mr. Quincy brought me a Letter from , in which he lets me know that you and the Family were well. This is very refreshing News. We went to Meeting at Wells and had the Pleasure of hearing My Friend, upon  ""Be not Partaker's in other Mens Sins: Keep yourselves pure."" -- Mr. Hemenway came and kindly invited us to dine, but we had engaged a Dinner at Littlefields, so we returned there, dined and took our Horses to Meeting in the Afternoon, and heard the Minister again, upon  ""Seek first the Kingdom of God and his Righteousness, and all these Things shall be added unto you."" -- There is a great Pleasure in Hearing Sermons so serious, so clear, so sensible, and instructive as these. We went to Mr. Hemmenways, and as it rained a little He put out our Horses and we took a Bed with him, i.e. Mr. Winthrop and I. You know I never get or save any Thing by cozening  or classmating; so I gave Pistareens enough among the Children and Servants to have paid twice for my Entertainment. Josiah Quincy,  impetuous and vehement, would not stop, but drove forward, I suppose that he might get upon the Fishing Ground before his Brother Sam. and me. -- I find that the Divines and Lawyers, this Way are always all Tories. Brother Hemmenway is as impartial as any I have seen or heard of -- James Sullivan seems half inclined to be a Whigg. Mr. Winthrop has been just making some Observations, which I think worth sending to you. Upon Reading an Observation in the Farmers fourth Letter, that some of our, (the  Massachusetts) Resolves and Publications had better have been suppressed, Mr. Winthrop said, that many Things in our News Papers ought to have been suppressed. For example, Whenever there was the least popular Commotion, or Disturbance, it was instantly put in all the News Papers, in this Province. But in all the other Provinces they took Care to conceal and suppress every such Thing. Another Thing He says, We ought to avoid all Paragraphs in our Papers about our own Manufactures -- especially all vapouring puffing Advertisements about them, because such Paragraphs only tend to provoke the Ministry, Merchants and Manufacturers in England, to confine and restrain or prohibit our Manufactures. But our Presses, in  Boston,  Salem, and  Newbury Port are under no Regulation, nor any judicious prudent Care. Therefore it seems impracticable to keep out such Imprudences. The Printers are hot, indiscreet Men, and they are under the Influence of others as hot,  and injudicious as themselves, very often. For my own Part it has long been my Resolution to avoid being concerned in councilling, or aiding or abetting any Tumult or Disorder, to avoid all exceptionable Scribbling in the Newspaper, of every Kind, to avoid all Passion and personal Altercation or Reflections. I have found it difficult, to keep these Resolutions exactly, all but the last however I have religiously and punctiliously, observed, these six Years. Arrived last Evening at  Falmouth, and procured a New Place to Lodge at, Mrs. Eustons. Quincy and I, have taken a Bed together. My Brother  came to pay his Respects to me, and to invite me to a Bed in his House, but I was fixed before, and therefore thanked him and excused myself. It is a very neat House where We sleep. The Desk and Table shine like Mirrors. The floors are clean and white and nicely sanded &c. But when shall I get home? This tedious journey will produce me very little Profit. I never saw  Falmouth before with such lean Expectations and empty . I am much concerned for my Family: These Acts of Parliament and ministerial Maneuvres, will injure me, both in my Property and Business, as much as any Person whatever, in Proportion.   "
"Falmouth  July 5, 1774
","My  I cant be easy without my Pen in my Hand, yet I know not what to write. I have this Morning heard a Dialogue between  and a Captain Pote of  Falmouth. Gardiner says he cant subscribe the Non Consumption Agreement, because he has 100 Men coming from  England to settle upon  Kennebeck River, and he must supply them, which he cant do without English Goods. That Agreement he says may do, at  Boston, but not in the Eastern Country. Pote said he never would sign it, and rail'd away at  Boston Mobs, drowning Tea, and tarring Malcom. James Sullivan at Dinner told us a Story or two. -- One Member of the General Court he said as they came down Stairs after their Dissolution at  Salem, said to him  ""Tho we are  we died scrabbling, did not We."" -- This is not very witty I think. Another Story was of a Piece of Wit of Brother Porter of  Salem. He came upon the Floor and asked a Member  ""What State are you in now?"" The Member answered  ""in a State of Nature."" -- Ay says Porter,  ""and you will be d--d before you will get into a State of Grace."" I spent an Hour last Evening at Mr. Wyers with Judge Cushing. Wyers Father, who has a little Place in the Customs came in. He began, upon  and told us, that Mr. Smith had a Fast last Week  which he attended. Mr. Gillman preached, he said, Part of the Day and told them that the judgments of God upon the Land, were in Consequence of the Mobbs and Riots, which had prevailed in the Country -- and then turning to me, old Wyer said  ""What do you think of that Mr. Adams?"" -- I answered, I cant say but Mobs and Violences may have been one Cause of our Calamities. I am inclined to think that they do come in for a share: But there are many other Causes; did not Mr. Gillman mention Bribery and Corruption, as another Cause? -- He ought to have been impartial, and pointed out the Venality which prevails in the Land as a Cause, as well as Tumults. --  ""I think he did"" says Wyer. I might have pursued my , whether, he did not mention the Universal Pilfering, Robbery and Picking of Pocketts, which prevails in the Land -- as every Mans Pockett upon the Continent is picked every Day, by taking from him Duties without his Consent. I might have  inquired whether he mentioned the universal Spirit of Debauchery, Dissipation, Luxury, Effeminacy and Gaming which the late ministerial Measures are introducing, &c. &c. &c. but I forbore. How much Profaneness, Leudness, Intemperance, &c. have been introduced by the Army and Navy, and Revenue -- how much servility, Venality And Artifice and Hypocricy, have been introduced among the Ambitious and Avaricious by the british  of the last 10 Years? In short the original faulty Causes of all the Vices which have been introduced, these last 10 Years, are the Political Innovations of the last 10 Years. This is no Justification and a poor Excuse for the Girls who have been debauched, and for the Injustice which has been committed, in some Riots.   But surely the Soldiers, Sailors, and Excisemen, who have occasioned these Vices ought not to reproach those they have corrupted. These Tories act the Part of the Devil -- they tempt Men and Women into sin, and then reproach them for It, and become soon their Tormentors for it. A Tempter and Tormentor, is the Character of the Devil. -- Hutchinson, Oliver, and others of their Circle, who for their own Ends of Ambition and Avarice, have procured, promoted, encouraged, councilled, aided and abetted the Taxation of America, have been the Real Tempters of their Countrymen and Women, into all the Vices, sins, Crimes and follies which that Taxation has occasioned: And now by  and their Friends, Dependents, and Votaries, they  [are ] reproaching those very Men and Women, with those Vices and follies, Sins and Crimes. There is not a Sin which prevails more universally and has prevailed longer, than Prodigality, in Furniture, Equipage,  and Diet. And I believe that this Vice, this Sin has as large a Share in drawing down the judgments of Heaven as any. And perhaps the Punishment that is inflicted, may work medicinally, and cure the Desease.   "
"Falmouth  July. 6, 1774
","Mobs are the trite  of Declamation and Invective, among all the ministerial People, far and near. They are grown universally learned in the Nature, Tendency and Consequences of them, and very eloquent and pathetic in descanting upon them. They are Sources of all kinds of Evils, Vices, and Crimes, they say. They give Rise to Prophaneness, Intemperance, Thefts, Robberies, Murders, and Treason. Cursing, Swearing, Drunkenness, Gluttony, Leudness, Trespasses, Maims, are necessarily involved in them and occasioned by them. Besides, they render the Populace, the Rabble, the scum of the Earth, insolent, and disorderly, impudent, and abusive. They give Rise to Lying, Hypocricy, Chicanery, and even Perjury among the People, who are driven to such Artifices, and Crimes, to conceal themselves and their Companions, from Prosecutions in Consequence of them. This is the Picture drawn by the Tory Pencil: and it must be granted to be a Likeness; but this is Declamation. What Consequence is to be drawn from this Description? Shall We submit to Parliamentary Taxation, to avoid Mobs? Will not Parliamentary Taxation if established, occasion Vices, Crimes and Follies, infinitely more numerous, dangerous, and fatal to the Community? Will not parliamentary Taxation if established, raise a Revenue, unjustly and wrongfully? If this Revenue is scattered by the Hand of Corruption, among the public Officers, and Magistrates and Rulers, in the Community, will it not propagate Vices more numerous, more malignant and pestilential among them. Will it not render Magistrates servile, and fawning to their vicious ?  and insolent and Tyrannical to their Inferiours? Is Insolence, Abuse and Impudence more tolerable in a Magistrate than in a subject? Is it not more constantly and extensively, pernicious? And does not the Example of Vice and Folly, in Magistrates descend, and spread downwards among the People? Besides is not the Insolence of Officers and Soldiers, and Seamen, in the Army and Navy as mischievous as that of Porters,  Sailors in Merchant Service? Are not Riots raised and made by Armed Men, as bad as those by unarmed? Is not an Assault upon a civil officer, and a Rescue of a Prisoner  of lawfull Authority, made by Soldiers with Swords or Bayonets, as bad as if made  [by] Tradesmen with Staves? Is not the Killing of a Child by R.  and the slaughter of half a Dozen Citizens by a Party of Soldiers, as bad as pulling down a House, or drowning a Cargo of Tea? even if both should be allowed to be unlawfull. Parties may go on declaiming: but it is not easy to say, which Party has excited most Riots, which has published most Libels, which have propagated most Slander, and Defamation. Verbal Scandal has been propagated in great Abundance by both Parties. But there is this Difference, that one Party have enjoyed almost all public Offices, and therefore their  has been spread among the People more secretly, more maliciously and more effectually. It has gone with greater Authority, and been scattered by Instruments more industrious. The ministerial News Papers have swarmed with as numerous and as malicious Libels as the Whiggs antiministerial ones. Fleets Paper, Meins Chronicle, &c. &c. have been as virulent as any that was ever in the Province. These Bickerings of opposite Parties, and their mutual Reproaches, their Declamations, their Sing Song, their Triumphs and , their Dismals, and Prophecies, are all Delusion. We very seldom hear any solid Reasoning. I wish always to discuss the Question, without all Painting, Pathos, Rhetoric, or Flourish of every Kind. And the Question seems to me to be, whether the  american Colonies are to be considered, as a distinct Community so far as to have a Right to judge for themselves, when the fundamentals of their Government are destroyed or invaded? Or Whether they are to be considered as a Part of the whole British Empire, the whole  English Nation, so far as to be bound in , Conscience or Interest by the general Sense of the whole Nation? However if this was the Rule, I believe it is very far from the general Sense of the whole Nation that  America  be taxed by the british Parliament. If the Sense of  [all ] of the Empire, could be fairly and truly collected, it would appear, I believe, that a great Majority would be against taxing us, against or without our Consent. It is very certain that the Sense of Parliament is not the Sense of the Empire, nor a sure Indication of it. But if all other Parts of the Empire were agreed unanimously in the Propriety and Rectitude of taxing us, this would not bind us. It is a fundamental, inherent, and unalienable Right of the People that they have some Check, Influence, or Controul in their  Legislature. If the Right of Taxation is conceded to Parliament, the Americans have no Check, or Influence at all left. -- This Reasoning never was nor can be answered.   "
"Falmouth  July 6th: 1774
","Our J.  H. [ Hutchinson] is eternally giving his Political Hints. In a Cause, this Morning, Somebody named Captn. Mackay as a Refferee. I said ""an honest Man!"" -- ""Yes"" says H[utchinso]n, ""he's an honest Man, only misled.-He he he,"" blinking, and grinning.-At Dinner, to day, Somebody mentioned Determinations in the Lords House (the Court sitts in the Meeting House). -- ""I've known many very bad Determinations in the Lords House of late"" says he, meaning a Fling upon the Clergy.-He is perpetually flinging about the Fasts, and ironically talking about getting Home to the Fast. A Gentleman told me, that he had heard him say frequently, that the Fast was perfect Blasphemy. -- ""Why dont they pay for the Tea? Refuse to pay for the Tea! and go to fasting and praying for Direction! perfect Blasphemy!"" This is the Moderation, Candor, Impartiality, Prudence, Patience, Forbearance, and Condescention of our J[ustic]e. S[amuel] Q[uincy] said Yesterday, as Josa. told me, that he was for staying at home and not going to Meeting as  they i.e. the Meetings are now managed. Such is the Bitterness and Rancour, the Malice and Revenge, the Pride and Vanity which prevails in these Men. And such Minds are possessed of all the Power of the Province.' S. makes no Fortune this Court. There is very little Business here, it is true, but S. gets very little of that little-less than any Body. Wyer retains his old good Nature and good , his Wit, such as it is, and his Fancy, with its wildness. Bradbury retains his Anxiety and his plaintive,  Manner, David Sewal his Softness, and conceited Modesty. Bradbury and Sewall always roast Dr. Gardiner, at these Courts, but they have done it more now than usual, as Gardiner had not me to protect him. -- See how I think of myself! I believe it is Time to think a little about my Family and Farm. The fine Weather, we have had for 8 or 10 days past I hope has been carefully improved to get in my Hay. It is a great Mortification to me that I could not attend every Step of their Progress in mowing, making and carting. I long to see what Burden. But I long more still to see to the procuring more Sea Weed and Marsh Mud and Sand &c. However my Prospect is interrupted again. I shall have no Time. I must prepare for a journey to Philadelphia, a long journey indeed! But if the Length of the journey was all, it would be no burden. But the Consideration of What is to be done, is of great Weight. Great Things are wanted to be done, and little Things only I fear can be done. I dread the Thought of the Congress's falling short of the Expectations of the Continent, but especially of the People of this Province.  avaunt! I will do my Duty, and leave the Event. If I have the Approbation of my own Mind, whether applauded or censured, blessed or cursed, by the World, I will not be unhappy. Certainly I shall enjoy good Company, good Conversation, and shall have a fine Ride, and see a little more of the World than I have seen before. I think it will be necessary to make me up, a Couple of Pieces of new . I am told, they wash miserably, at N. York, the Jerseys and Philadelphia too in Comparison of Boston, and am advised to carry a great deal of Linnen. Whether to make me a Suit of new , at Boston or to make them at Phyladelphia, and what to make I know not, nor do I know how I shall go-whether on Horse back, in a Curricle, a Phaeton, or altogether in a Stage Coach I know not. The Letters I have written or may write, my Dear, must be kept secret or at least  with great Caution. Mr. Fairservice goes tomorrow: by him I shall send a . Kiss my dear Babes for me. Your I believe I forgot to tell you one Anecdote: When I first came to this House it was late in the Afternoon, and I had ridden 35 miles at least. ""Madam"" said I to Mrs. Huston, ""is it  for a weary Traveller to refresh himself with a Dish of Tea provided it has been honestly smuggled, or paid no Duties?"" ""No sir, said she, we have renounced all Tea in this Place. I cant make Tea, but He make you Coffee."" Accordingly I have drank Coffee every Afternoon since, and have borne it very well. Tea must be universally renounced. I must be weaned, and the sooner, the better.   "

","My Dear Have you seen a List of the Addressers of the late Governor? There is one abroad, with the Character, Profession or Occupation of each Person against his Name. I have never seen it but judge Brown says, against the Name of Andrew Fanuil Phillips, is ""Nothing,"" and that Andrew when he first heard of it said, ""Better be nothing with one Side, than every Thing with the other.""-This was witty and smart, whether Andrew said it, or what is more likely, it was made for him. A Notion prevails among all Parties that it is politest and genteelest to be on the Side of Administration, that the better Sort, the Wiser Few, are on one Side; and that the Multitude, the Vulgar, the Herd, the Rabble, the Mob  are on the other. So difficult it is for the frail feeble Mind of Man to shake itself loose from all Prejudices and Habits. However Andrew, or his Prompter is perfectly Right, in his judgment, and will finally be proved to be so, that the lowest on the Tory Scale, will make it more for his Interest than the highest on the Whiggish. And as long as a Man Adhers immoveably to his own Interest, and has Understanding or Luck enough to secure and promote it, he will have the Character of a Man of Sense And will be respected by a selfish World. I know of no better Reason for this it than this -- that most Men are conscious that they aim at their own Interest only, and that if they fail it is owing to short Sight or ill Luck, and therefore cant blame, but secretly applaud, admire and sometimes envy those whose Capacities have proved greater and Fortunes more prosperous. I am to dine with Mr. Waldo, . Betty, as you once said. I am engaged in a famous Cause: The Cause of King, of Scarborough  a Mob, that broke into his House, and rifled his Papers, and terrifyed him, his Wife, Children and Servants in the Night. The Terror, and Distress, the Distraction and Horror of this Family cannot be described by Words or painted upon Canvass. It is enough to move a Statue, to melt an Heart of Stone, to read the Story. A Mind susceptible of the Feelings of Humanity, an Heart which can be touch'd with Sensibi[li]ty for human Misery and Wretchedness, must reluct and must burn with Resentment and Indignation, at such outragious Injuries.' These private Mobs, I do and will detest. If Popular Commotions can be justifyed, in Opposition to Attacks upon the Constitution, it can be only when Fundamentals are invaded, nor then unless for absolute Necessity and with great Caution. But these Tarrings and Featherings, these breaking open Houses by rude and insolent Rabbles, for private in Resentment for private Wrongs or in pursuance of private Prejudices and Passions, must be discountenanced, cannot be even excused upon any Principle which can be entertained by a good Citizen-a worthy Member of Society. Dined With Mr. Collector Francis Waldo,  in Company with Mr. Winthrop, the two Quincys and the two Sullivans. All very social and chearfull-full of Politicks. S. Quincy's Tongue ran as fast as any Bodies. He was clear in it, that the House of Commons had no Right to take Money out of our Pocketts, any more than any foreign Staterepeated large Paragraphs from a Publication of Mr. Burke's in 1766, and large Paragraphs from Junius Americanus &c. This is to talk and to shine, before Persons who have no Capacity of judging, and who do not know that he is ignorant of every Rope in the Ship. I shant be able to get away, till next Week. I am concerned only in 2 or 3 Cases and none of them are come on yet. Such an Eastern Circuit I never made. I shall bring home as much as I brought from home I hope, and not much more, I fear. I go mourning in my Heart, all the Day long,  I say nothing. I am melancholly for the Public, and anxious for my Family, as for myself a Frock and Trowsers, an Hoe and Spade, would do for my Remaining Days. For God Sake make your Children, hardy, active and industrious, for Strength, Activity and Industry will be their only Resource and Dependance.   "

","My Dr. I never enjoyed better Health in any of my journeys, but this has been the most tedious, the most irksome, the most gloomy and  I ever made. I cannot with all my  and christian Resignation keep up my Spirits. The dismal Prospect before me, my Family, and my Country, are too much, for my Fortitude. The Day before Yesterday, a Gentleman came and spoke to me, asked me to dine with him on Saturday. Said he was very sorry I had not better Lodgings in Town, desired if I came to Town again I would take a Bed at his House and make his House my Home. I should always be very welcome. I told him I had not the Pleasure of knowing him. He said his Name was Codman. I said I was very much obliged to him, but  I was very well accommodated where I lodged. I had a clean Bed and a very neat House, and a Chamber to myself, and every Thing I wanted. Saturday I dined with him in Company with Brigadier Prebble, Major Freeman and his son, &c. and a very genteel Dinner we had. Salt Fish and all its apparatus, roast Chickens, Bacon, Pees, as fine a Salad as ever was made, and a rich meat Pie-Tarts and Custards &c., good Wine and as good Punch as ever you made. A large spacious, elegant House, Yard and Garden &c. I thought I had got into the Palace of a Nobleman. After Dinner when I was obliged to come away, he renewed his Invitation to me to make his House my Home, whenever I should come to Town again.  I dined with Coll., Sherriff, alias Bill Tyng. Mrs. Ross and her Daughter Mrs. Tyng dined with us and the Court and Clerk and some of the Bar. At Table We were speaking about Captain Maccarty, which led to the Affrican Trade. J[udge] Trowbridge said that was a very humane and Christian Trade to be sure, that of making Slaves.-Ay, says I, It makes no great Odds, it is a Trade that almost all Mankind have been concerned in, all over the Globe, since Adam, more or less in one Way and another -- This occasioned a Laugh. At another Time, J. Trowbridge said, it seems by  Barres Speeches that Mr. Otis has acquired Honour, by releasing his Damages to Robbinson.-Yes, says I, he has acquired Honour with all Generations. -- Trowbridge. He did not make much Profit I think.-Adams. True, but the less Profit the more Honour. He was a Man of Honour and Generosity. And those who think he was mistaken will pity him. Thus you see how foolish I am. I cannot avoid exposing myself, before these high Folk-my Feelings will at Times overcome my Modesty and Reserve-my Prudence, Policy and Discretion. I have a Zeal at my Heart, for my Country and her Friends, which I cannot smother or conceal: it will burn out at Times and in Companies where it ought to be latent in my Breast. This Zeal will prove fatal to the Fortune and Felicity of my Family, if it is not regulated by a cooler judgment than mine has hitherto been.  Otis's Phrase is ""The Zeal-Pot boils over."" I am to wait upon Brother Bradbury to Meeting , and to dine with Brother Wyer. When I shall get home I know not. But, if possible, it shall be before next Saturday night. I long for that Time to come, when My Dear Wife and my Charming little Prattlers will embrace me. "

","My Dr. I received your kind Letter, at New York, and it is not easy for you to imagine the Pleasure it has given me. I have not found a single Opportunity to write since I left Boston, excepting by the Post and I dont choose to write by that Conveyance, for fear of foul Play. But as We are now within forty two Miles of Philadelphia, I hope there to find some private Hand by which I can convey this. The Particulars of our journey, I must reserve, to be communicated after my Return. It would take a Volume to describe the whole. It has been upon the whole an Agreable Jaunt, We have had Opportunities to see the World, and to form Acquaintances with the most eminent and famous Men, in the several Colonies we have passed through. We have been treated with unbounded Civility, Complaisance, and Respect. We Yesterday visited Nassau Hall , and were politely treated by the Schollars, Tutors, Professors and President, whom We are, this Day to hear preach. Tomorrow We reach the Theatre of Action. God Almighty grant us Wisdom and Virtue sufficient for the high Trust that is devolved upon Us. The Spirit of the People wherever we have been seems to be very favourable. They universally consider our Cause as their own, and express the firmest Resolution, to abide the Determination of the Congress. I am anxious for our perplexed, distressed Province-hope they will be directed into the right Path. Let me  you, my Dear, to make yourself as easy and quiet as possible. Resignation to the Will of Heaven is our only Resource in such dangerous Times. Prudence and Caution should be our Guides. I have the strongest Hopes, that We shall yet see a clearer Sky, and better Times. Remember my tender Love to my little Nabby. Tell her she must write me a Letter and  it in the next you send. I am charmed with your Amusement with our little Johnny. Tell him I am glad to hear he is so good a Boy as to read to his Mamma, for her Entertainment, and to keep himself out of the Company of rude Children. Tell him I hope to hear a good Account of his Accidence and Nomenclature, when I return.  Kiss my little Charley and Tommy for me. Tell them I shall be at Home by November, but how much sooner I know not. Remember me to all  Friends-particularly to Uncle Quincy, your Pappa and Family, and Dr. Tufts and Family. Mr. Thaxter, I hope, is a good Companion, in your Solitude. Tell him, if he devotes his Soul and Body to his Books, I hope, notwithstanding the Darkness of these Days, he will not find them unprofitable Sacrifices in future. I have received three very obliging Letters, from Tudor, Trumble, and Hill. They have cheared us, in our Wanderings, and done us much Service. My Compliments to Mr. Wibirt and  Quincy, when you see them. Your Account of the Rain refreshed me. I hope our Husbandry is prudently and industriously managed. Frugality must be our Support. Our , in this journey, will be very great-our only Reward will be the consolatory Reflection that We toil, spend our Time, and tempt Dangers for the public Good-happy indeed, if we do any good! The Education of our Children is never out of my Mind. Train them to Virtue, habituate them to industry, activity, and Spirit. Make them consider every Vice, as  and unmanly: fire them with Ambition to be usefull-make them disdain to be destitute of any usefull, or ornamental Knowledge or Accomplishment. Fix their Ambition upon great and solid Objects, and their Contempt upon little, frivolous, and useless ones.  [It] is Time, my dear, for you to begin to teach them French. Every Decency, Grace, and Honesty should be inculcated upon them. I have [kept] a few Minutes by Way of journal, which shall be your Entertainment when I come home, but We have had so many Persons and so various Characters to converse with, and so many Objects to view, that I have not been able to be so particular as I could wish.-I am, with the tenderest  Affection and Concern, your wandering   "

","My Dear When or where this Letter will find you, I know not. In what Scenes of Distress and Terror, I cannot foresee.-We have received a confused Account from Boston, of a  Catastrophy. The Particulars, We have not heard. We are waiting with the Utmost Anxiety and Impatience, for further Intelligence. The Effect of the News We have both upon the Congress and the Inhabitants of this City, was very great-great indeed! Every Gentleman seems to consider the Bombardment of Boston, as the Bombardment, of the Capital of his own Province. Our Deliberations are grave and serious indeed. It is a great Affliction to me that I cannot write to you oftener than I do. But there are so many Hindrances, that I cannot. It would fill Volumes, to give you an Idea of the scenes I behold and the Characters I converse with. We have so much Business, so much Ceremony, so much Company, so many Visits to recive and return, that I have not Time to write. And the Times are such, as render it imprudent to write freely. We cannot depart from this Place,  the Business of the Congress is compleated, and it is the general Disposition to proceed slowly. When I shall be at home I cant say. If there is Distress and Danger in Boston, pray invite our Friends, as many as possible, to take an Assylum with you. Mrs. Cushing and Mrs. Adams if you can. There is in the Congress a Collection of the greatest Men upon this Continent, in Point of Abilities, Virtues and Fortunes. The Magnanimity, and public Spirit, which I see here, makes me blush for the sordid venal Herd, which I have seen in my own Province. The Addressers, and the new Councillors, are held in universal Contempt and Abhorrence, from one End of the Continent to the other. Be not under any Concern for me. There is little Danger from any Thing We shall do, at the Congress. There is such a Spirit,  the Colonies, and the Members of the Congress are such Characters, that no Danger can happen to Us, which will not involve the whole Continent, in Universal Desolation, and in that Case who would wish to live? Make my Compliments to Mr. Thaxter and Mr. Rice-and to every other of my Friends. My Love to all my dear Children-tell them to be good, and to mind their Books. I shall come home and see them, I hope, the latter End of next Month. P.S. You will judge how Things are like to be in Boston, and whether it will not be best to remove the Office entirely to Braintree. Mr. Hill and Williams, may come up, if they choose, paying for their Board. "
"Phyladelphia  Septr. 14, 1774
","My Dear I have written but once to you since I left you. This is to be imputed to a Variety of Causes, which I cannot explain for Want of Time. It would fill Volumes to give you an exact Idea of the whole Tour. My Time is to totally filled from the Moment I get out of Bed,  I return to it. Visits, Ceremonies, Company, Business, News Papers, Pamphlets &c. &c. &c. The Congress will, to all present Appearance be well united and in such Measures, I hope will give Satisfaction to the Friends of our Country. A Tory here is the most despicable Animal in the Creation. Spiders, Toads, Snakes, are their only proper Emblems. The Massachusetts Councillors, and Addressers are held in curious Esteem here, as you will see. The Spirit, the Firmness, the Prudence of our Province are vastly applauded, and We are universally acknowledged the Saviours and Defenders of American Liberty. The Designs, and Plans of the Congress, must not be communicated,  compleated, and We shall move with great Deliberation. When I shall come home I know not, but at present I dont expect to take my Leave of this City these four Weeks. My Compliments, Love, Service where they are due. My Babes are never out of my Mind, nor absent from my Heart. "
"Phyladelphia  Septr. 16, 1774
","Having a Leisure Moment, while the Congress is assembling, I gladly embrace it to write you a Line. When the Congress first met, Mr. Cushing made a Motion, that it should be opened with Prayer. It was opposed by Mr. Jay of N. York and Mr. Rutledge of South Carolina, because we were so divided in religious Sentiments, some Episcopalians, some Quakers, some Aanabaptists, some Presbyterians and some Congregationalists, so that We could not join in the same Act of Worship.-Mr. S. Adams arose and said he was no Bigot, and could hear a Prayer from a Gentleman of Piety and Virtue, who was at the same Time a Friend to his Country. He was a Stranger in Phyladelphia, but had heard that Mr. Duche (Dushay they pronounce it) deserved that Character, and therefore he moved that Mr. Duche, an episcopal Clergyman, might be desired, to read Prayers to the Congress, tomorrow Morning. The Motion was seconded and passed in the Affirmative. Mr. Randolph our President, waited on Mr. Duche, and received for Answer that if his Health would permit, he certainly would. Accordingly next Morning he appeared with his Clerk and in his Pontificallibus, and read several Prayers, in the established Form; and then read the  Collect for the seventh day of September, which was the Thirty fifth Psalm. -You must remember this was the next Morning after we heard the horrible Rumour, of the Cannonade of Boston.-I never saw a greater Effect upon an Audience. It seemed as if Heaven had ordained that Psalm to be read on that Morning. After this Mr. Duche, unexpected to every Body struck out into an extemporary Prayer, which filled the Bosom of every Man present. I must confess I never heard a better Prayer or one, so well pronounced. Episcopalian as he is, Dr. Cooper himself never prayed with such , such Ardor, such Earnestness and Pathos, and in Language so elegant and sublime-for America, for the Congress, for The Province of Massachusetts Bay, and especially the Town of Boston. It has had an excellent Effect upon every Body here. I must beg you to read that Psalm. If there was any Faith in the sortes Virgilianae, or sortes Homericae, or especially the Sortes biblicae, it would be thought providential. It will amuse your Friends to read this Letter and the 35th. Psalm to them. Read it to your Father and Mr. Wibirt.-I wonder what our Braintree Churchmen would think of this?-Mr. Duche is one of the most ingenious Men, and best Characters, and greatest orators in the Episcopal order, upon this Continent-Yet a Zealous Friend of Liberty and his Country. I long to see my dear Family. God bless, preserve and prosper it. "
"Phyladelphia  Septr. 18, 1774
","My Dear I received your very  Letter, by Mr. Marston, and have received two others, which gave me much Pleasure. I have wrote several Letters, but whether they have reached you I know not. There is so much Rascallity in the Management of Letters, now come in Fashion, that I am determined to write nothing of Consequence, not even to the Friend of my Bosom, but by Conveyances which I can be sure of. The Proceedings of the Congress, are all a profound Secret, as yet, except two Votes which were passed Yesterday, and ordered to be printed. You will see them from every Quarter. These Votes were passed in full Congress with perfect Unanimity. The Esteem, the Affection, the Admiration, for the People of Boston and the Massachusetts, which were expressed Yesterday, And the fixed Determination that they should be supported, were enough to melt an Heart of Stone. I saw the Tears gush  gush into the Eyes of the old, grave, pacific Quakers of Pensylvania. You cannot conceive my Dear, the Harry of Business, Visits and Ceremonies which we are obliged to go through. We have a delicate Course to steer, between too much Activity and too much Insensibility, in our critical interested situation. I flatter myself however, that We shall conduct our Embassy in such a manner as to merit the Approbation of our Country. It has taken Us much Time to get acquainted with the Tempers, Views, Characters, and Designs of Persons and to let them into the Circumstances of our Province. My dear   do, intreat every Friend I have to write me. Every Line which comes from our Friends is greedily enquired after, and our Letters have done us vast service. Middlesex and Suffolk have acquired unbounded  here. There is No Idea of Submission, here in any Bodies head. Thank my dear Nabby for her Letter-tell her it has given me great Spirits. Kiss all my sweet ones for me. "
"Phyladelphia  Septr. 18, 1774
","My Dear In your last you inquire tenderly after my Health, and how we found the People upon our journey, and how We were treated. I have enjoyed as good Health as usual, and much more than I know how to account for, when I consider the  Heat of the Weather, and the incessant Feasting I have endured ever since I left Boston. The People, in Connecticutt, New York, the Jerseys and Pensylvania, we have found  well principled, and very well inclined, altho some Persons in N. York and Phyladelphia, wanted a little Animation. Their Zeal however has increased wonderfully since we began our journey. When the horrid News was brought here of the Bombardment of Boston, which made us  miserable for two days, We saw Proofs both of the Sympathy and the Resolution, of the Continent. WAR! WAR! WAR! was the Cry, and it was pronounced in a Tone, which would have done  to the Oratory of a Briton or a Roman. If it had proved true, you would have heard the Thunder of an American Congress. I have not Time nor Language to express the Hospitality and Civility, the studied and expensive Respect with which we have been treated, in every Stage of our Progress. If Cambden, Chatham, Richmond and St. Asaph had travelled  the Country, they could not have been entertained with greater Demonstrations of Respect, than Cushing, Paine and the Brace of Adams's have been. The Particulars will amuse you, when We return. I confess the Kindness, the Affection, the Applause, which has been given to me and especially, to our Province, have many a Time filled my Bosom, and streamed from my Eyes. My best Respects to  Warren and his Lady when you write to them. I wish to write them. "

","My Dear I am very well yet:-write to me as often as you can, and send your Letters to the Office in Boston or to Mr. Cranches, whence they will be sent by the first Conveyance. I am anxious to know how you can live without Government. But the Experiment must be . The Evils will not be found so dreadfull as you  [apprehend] them.  Frugality, my Dear, Frugality, , Parcimony must be our Refuge. I hope the Ladies are every day diminishing their ornaments, and the Gentlemen too. Let us Eat Potatoes and drink Water. Let us wear Canvass, and undressed Sheepskins, rather than submit to the unrighteous, and ignominious Domination that is prepared for Us.-Tel Brackett, I shall make him leave off drinking Rum. We cant let him fight yet.-My Love to my dear ones. "

","My Dear I would not loose the Opportunity of writing to you-tho I must be short. Tedious, indeed is our Business.-Slow, as Snails. I have not been used to such Ways. We sit only before Dinner. We dine at four O Clock. We are crowded with a Levee in the Evening. Fifty Gentlemen meeting together, all Strangers, are not acquainted with Each others Language, Ideas, Views, Designs. They are therefore jealous, of each other-fearfull, timid, skittish,- "
"Phyladelphia  Septr. 29, 1774
","My Dear Sitting down to write to you, is a Scene almost too tender for my State of Nerves. It calls up to my View the anxious,  State you must be in, amidst the Confusions and Dangers, which surround you. I long to return, and administer all the Consolation in my Power, but when I shall have accomplished all the Business I have to do here, I know not, and if it should be necessary to stay here till Christmas, or longer, in order to effect our Purposes, I am determined patiently to wait. Patience, Forbearance, Long Suffering, are the Lessons taught here for our Province, and at the same Time absolute and open Resistance to the new Government. I wish I could convince Gentlemen, of the Danger, or Impracticability of this as fully as I believe it myself. The Art and Address, of Ambassadors from a dozen  Powers of Europe, nay of a Conclave of Cardinals at the Election of a Pope, or of the Princes in  Germany at the Choice of an Emperor, would not exceed the Specimens We have seen.-- Yet the Congress all profess the same political Principles. They all profess to consider our Province as suffering in the common Cause, and indeed they seem to feel for Us, as if for themselves. We have had as great Questions to discuss as ever engaged the Attention of Men, and an infinite Multitude of them. I received a very kind Letter from , acquainting me with Mr. Cranch's designs of removing to  Braintree, which I approve very much -- and wish I had an House for every Family in  Boston, and Abilities to provide for them, in the Country. I submit it to you, my Dear, whether it would not be best to remove all the Books and Papers and Furniture in the Office at  Boston up to  Braintree. There will be no Business there nor , I suppose, and my young Friends can study there better than in  Boston at present. I shall be  with Kindness, in this Place. We go to congress at Nine, and there We stay, most earnestly engaged in Debates upon the most abstruse Misteries of State untill three in the Afternoon, then We adjourn, and go to  [Dinner] with some of the Nobles of  Pensylvania, at four  [O Clock] and feast upon ten thousand Delicacies, and sitt drinking Madeira, Claret and Burgundy till six or seven, and then go home, fatigued to death with Business, Company, and Care.-- Yet I hold it out, surprizingly. I drink no Cyder, but feast upon  Phyladelphia Beer, and Porter. A Gentleman, one Mr. Hare, has lately set up in this City a Manufactory of Porter, as good as any that comes from  London. I pray We may introduce it into the  Massachusetts. It agrees with me, infinitely better than Punch, Wine, or Cyder, or any other Spirituous Liquor.-- My Love to my dear Children one by one. My Compliments to Mr. Thaxter, and Rice and every Body else.  Yours most affectionately, "
"Phyladelphia  Octr. 7, 1774
","My Dear I thank you for all your kind . I wish I could write to you, much oftener than I do. I wish I could write to you, a Dozen Letters every day. But the Business before me, is so arduous and takes up my Time so entirely, that I cannot write often. I had the Characters and Tempers, the Principles and Views of fifty Gentlemen total Strangers to me to study, and the Trade, Policy, and whole Interest of a Dozen Provinces, to learn when I came here. I have Multitudes of Pamphlets, News Papers, and private Letters to read. I have numberless Plans of Policy, and many Arguments to consider. I have many Visits to make and receive-much Ceremony to endure, which cannot be avoided, which you know I hate. There is a great Spirit in the Congress. But our People must be peaceable. Let them exercise every day in the Week, if they Will, the more the better. Let them furnish themselves with Artillery, Arms and Ammunition. Let them follow the Maxim, which you say they have adopted ""In Times of Peace, prepare for War."" But let them avoid War, if possible, if possible I say. Mr. Revere will bring you the Doings of the Congress, who are now, all around me debating what Advice to give to Boston and the Massachusetts Bay. We are all well-hope our Family is so-remember me to them all. I have advised you before to remove my Office from Boston to Braintree. It is now, I think absolutely necessary. Let the best Care be taken of all Books and Papers. Tell all my Clerks to mind their Books, and study hard-for their Country will stand in need of able Councillors. I must give you a general Licence to make my Compliments to all my Friends and Acquaintances: I have not Time to name them particularly. I wish they would all write to me-if they leave Letters at Edes and Gills, they will soon be sent to me. I long to be at home, but I cannot say when. I will never leave the Congress,  it rises, and when it will rise, I cannot say. And indeed I cannot say but We are better here than any where. We have fine Opportunities here to serve Boston and Massachusetts, by acquainting the whole Continent with the true State of them. Our Residence here greatly serves the Cause. The Spirit and Principles of Liberty, here, are greatly cherished, by our Presence and Conversation. The Elections of the last Week in this City, prove this. Mr. Dickenson was chosen almost unanimously a Representative of the County. The Broadbrims began an opposition to your Friend Mr. Mifflin, because he was too warm in the Cause. This instantly alarmed the Friends of Liberty and ended in the Election of Mr. Mifflin, by Eleven hundred Votes out of Thirteen, and in the Election of our Secretary Mr. Charles Thompson to be a Burgess with him. This is considered here as a most  and decisive Victory in favour of the American Cause. And it  [is ] said it will change the Ballance in the Legislature here against Mr. Galloway who has been supposed to sit on the Skirts of the American Advocates. Mrs. Mifflin who is a charming Quaker Girl, often enquires kindly after your Health.  Adieu my dear Wife-God bless you and yours. So wishes and prays, without ceasing, "

","My Dear I am wearied to Death with the Life I lead. The Business of the Congress is tedious, beyond Expression. This Assembly is like no other that ever existed. Every Man in it is a great Man-an orator, a , a statesman, and therefore every Man upon every Question must shew it his oratory, his Criticism and his Political Abilities. The Consequence of this is, that Business is drawn and spun out to an immeasurable Length. I believe if it was moved and seconded that We should come to a Resolution that Three and two make five We should be entertained with Logick and Rhetorick, Law, History,  and Mathematicks, concerning the Subject for two whole Days, and then We should pass the Resolution unanimously in the Affirmative. The perpetual Round of feasting too, which we are obliged to submit to, make the Pilgrimage more tedious to me. This Day I went to Dr. Allisons Meeting in the Forenoon and heard the Dr.-a good Discourse upon the Lords Supper. This is a Presbyterian Meeting. I confess I am not fond of the Presbyterian Meetings in this Town. I had rather go to Church. We have better Sermons, better Prayers, better Speakers, softer, sweeter , and gentecler Company. And I must confess, that the Episcopal Church is quite as agreable to my Taste as the Presbyterian. They are both Slaves to the Domination of the Priesthood. I like the Congregational Way best-next to that the Independant. This afternoon, led by Curiosity and good Company I strolled away to   Mother Church, or rather Grandmother Church, I mean the Romish Chappell. Heard a good, short, moral Essay upon the Duty of Parents to their Children, founded in justice and Charity, to take care of their Interests temporal and spiritual.  This Afternoons Entertainment was to me, most awfull and affecting. The poor Wretches, fingering their Beads, chanting Latin, not a Word of which they understood, their Pater Nosters and Ave Maria's. Their holy Water-their Crossing themselves perpetually-their Bowing to the Name of Jesus, their wherever they hear it-their Bowings, and Kneelings, and Genuflections before the Altar. The Dress of the Priest was rich with Lace-his Pulpit was Velvet and Gold. The Altar Piece was very rich-little Images and Crucifixes about-Wax Candles lighted up. But how shall I describe the Picture of our Saviour in a Frame of Marble over the Altar at full Length upon the Cross, in the Agonies, and the Blood dropping and streaming from his Wounds. The  consisting of an organ, and a Choir of singers, went all the Afternoon, excepting sermon Time, and the Assembly chanted-most sweetly and exquisitely. Here is every Thing which can lay hold of the  Eye, Ear, and Imagination. Every Thing which can charm and bewitch the simple and ignorant. I wonder how Luther ever broke the spell. "

","  New York has appointed an ample Representation in our Congress, and have appointed a provincial Congress. The People of the City, have siezed the City Arms and Ammunition, out of the Hands of the Mayor who is a Creature of the Governor. Lord North will be certainly disappointed, in his Expectation of seducing  New York. The Tories there, durst not  their Heads. The Jerseys are , and greatly assist the Friends of Liberty in  New York.   North Carolina has done bravely, chosen the old Delegates in Provincial Congress, and then confirmed the Choice in General Assembly, in Opposition to all that Governor Martin could do. The Assembly of this Colony is now sitting at  Hartford. We are treated with great Tenderness, Sympathy, Friendship and Respect.  is doing by this Colony, that can be done by Men -- both for  N.

I take this opportunity, to write, by our Committee who were sent to this Colony, just to let you know that I am comfortable, and shall proceed this afternoon. Pray write to me, and get all my Friends to write and let me be informed of every Thing that occurs. Send your Letters to Coll.

","My Dear  of  Fairfield, is this Moment arrived in his way to  Boston. He read us a Letter from the Dr. his Father dated Yesterday Sennight being Sunday. The Drs. Description of the Melancholly of the Town is enough to melt a Stone. The Tryals of that unhappy and devoted People are likely to be severe indeed. God grant that the Furnace of Affliction may refine them. God grant that they may be relieved from their present Distress. It is Arrogance and Presumption in human Sagacity to pretend to penetrate far into the Designs of Heaven. The most perfect Reverence and Resignation becomes us. But, I cant help depending upon this, that the present  Calamity of that beloved Town is intended to bind the Colonies together in more indissoluble Bands, and to animate their Exertions, at this great Crisis in the Affairs of Mankind. It has this Effect, in a most remarkable Degree, as far as I have yet seen or heard. It will plead, with all  America, with more irresistable Perswasion, than Angells trumpet tongued. In a Cause which interests the whole Globe, at a Time, when my Friends and Country are in such keen Distress, I am scarcely ever interrupted, in the least Degree, by Apprehensions for my Personal Safety. I am often concerned for you and our dear Babes, surrounded as you are by People who are too timorous and too much susceptible of . Many Fears and Jealousies and imaginary Dangers, will be suggested to you, but I hope you will not be impressed by them. In Case of real Danger, of which you cannot fail to have previous Intimations, fly to the Woods with our Children. Give my tenderest Love to them, and to all.  "

","I have an opportunity by Captn. Beale, to write you a Line. We all arrived last Night in this City. It would take many Sheets of Paper, to give you a Description of the Reception, We found here. The Militia were all in Arms, and almost the whole City out to Meet us. The Tories are put to Flight here, as effectually as the Mandamus Council at  Boston. They have associated, to stand by Continental and Provincial Congresses, &c. &c. &c. Such a Spirit was never seen in  New York. Jose Bass met with a Misfortune, in the Midst of some of the unnecessary Parade that was made about us. My Mare, being galled with an ugly Buckle in the Tackling, suddenly flinched and started in turning short round a Rock, in a shocking bad Road, overset the sulky which frightened her still more. She ran, and dashed the Body of the Sulky all to Pieces. I was obliged to leave my sulky, ship my  on board Mr. Cushings Carriage, buy me a Saddle and mount on Horse back. I am thankfull that Bass was not kill'd. He was in the utmost danger, but not materially hurt. I am sorry for this Accident, both on Account of the Trouble and , occasioned by it. I must pay your Father for his sulky. But in Times like these, such Little Accidents should not affect us. Let me caution you my Dear, to be upon your Guard against that Multitude of Affrights, and Alarms, which I fear, will surround you. Yet I hope the People with you, will grow more composed than they were. Our Prospect of a Union of the Colonies, is promising indeed. Never was there such a Spirit. Yet I feel anxious, because, there is always more Smoke than Fire -- more Noise than . Our Province is nowhere blamed. The Accounts of the Battle are exaggerated in our favour. -- My Love to all. I pray for you all, and hope to be prayed for. Certainly, There is a Providence -- certainly, We must depend upon Providence or We fail. Certainly the sincere Prayers of good Men, avail much. But Resignation is our Duty in all Events. I have this Day heard Mr. Livingston in the Morning and Dr. Rogers this afternoon -- excellent Men, and excellent Prayers and sermons. My Love to , Johnny, Charly and Tommy. Tell them they must be good, and Pappa will come home, before long.  "

My Friend , very cleverly caught the Small Pox, in two days after we arrived here, by Inoculation and has walked about the streets, every day since, and has got quite over it and quite well. He had about a Dozen Pimples upon the whole. Let his Father and Friends know this. We are distressed here for Want of Intelligence and Information from you and from  Boston,  Cambridge &c. &c. &c.

Bass has recover'd of the Small Pox. Our Debates and Deliberations are tedious, from Nine to four, five, and once near Six. Our Determinations very slow -- I hope sure. The Congress will support Us, but in their own Way. Not precisely in that Way which I could wish, but in a better Way than We could well expect, considering what an heterogeneous Body it is.

My Eyes depress my Spirits and my Health is quite infirm. Yet I keep about and attend Congress very constantly. I wish I could write freely to you my Dear, but I can not. The Scene before me, is complicated enough. It requires better Eyes and better Nerves than mine. Yet I will not despond. I will lay all Difficulties prostrate at my feet .... My Health and Life ought to be hazarded, in the Cause of my Country as well as yours, and all my friends. It is impossible to convey to you any adequate Idea of the Embarrassments, I am under. I wish that you and our Friends may not be in greater Distress than I am. I fear you are. Pray let me know as often as possible. Our Friends write to Mrs.-- not to me, this time. They dont let us know the State of  Boston People, nor the State of the Army in  Boston, so exactly as I could wish.

Battallion Men, Light Infantry, Grenadiers, Rifle Men, Light Horse, Artillery Men, with a fine train, all in Uniforms, going thro the manual Exercise and the Maneuvres, with remarkable Dexterity. All this has been accomplished in this City, since the 19th. of April. So sudden a formation of an Army never took Place any where. In Congress We are bound to secrecy: But, under the Rose, I believe, that ten thousand Men will be maintained in the  Massachusetts, and five thousand in  New York at the Continental .

","My Dear I have been this Morning to hear , a Preacher in this City whose Principles, Prayers and Sermons more nearly resemble, our those of our  New England Clergy than any that I have heard. His Discourse was a kind of Exposition on the thirty fifth Chapter of Isaiah. --  America was the Wilderness and the Solitary Place, and he said it would be glad, rejoice, and blossom as the Rose. He  to strengthen the weak Hands, and confirm the feeble Knees. He said to them that were of a fearful Heart, be strong, fear not: behold your God will come with Vengeance, even God with a Recompence will come and save you. No Lyon shall be there, nor any ravenous Beast shall go up thereon, but the redeemed shall walk there -- &c. He applied the whole Prophecy to this Country, and gave us, as animating an Entertainment, as I ever heard. He  and swell'd the Bosom of every Hearer. I hope you have received a Letter, in which I  you, a Pastoral Letter from the Synod of  New York and  Phyladelphia: by this you will see that the Clergy, this Way, are but now beginning to engage in Politicks, and they engage with a fervour that will produce wonderfull Effects. I can now inform you that the Congress have made Choice of the modest and virtuous, the amiable, generous and brave , to be the General of the American Army, and that he is to repair as soon as possible to the Camp before  Boston. This Appointment will have a great Effect, in cementing and securing the Union of these Colonies. -- The Continent is really in earnest in defending the Country. They have voted Ten Companies of Rifle Men to be sent from  Pensylvania,  Maryland and  Virginia, to join the Army before  Boston. These are an excellent Species of Light Infantry. They use a peculiar Kind of  [ . . . ]  [ call'd] a Rifle -- it has circular or  [ . . . ]  Grooves within the Barrell, and carries a Ball, with great Exactness to great Distances. They are the most accurate Marksmen in the World. I begin to hope We shall not sit all Summer. I hope the People of our Province, will treat the General with all that Confidence and Affection, that Politeness and Respect, which is due to one of the most important Characters in the World. The Liberties of  America, depend upon him, in a great Degree. I have never been able to obtain from our Province, any regular and particular Intelligence since I left it. Kent, Swift, Tudor, Dr. Cooper, Dr. Winthrop, and others wrote me often, last Fall -- not a Line from them this Time. I have found this Congress like the last. When We first came together, I found a strong jealousy of Us, from  New England, and the  Massachusetts in Particular. Suspicions were entertained of Designs of Independency -- an American Republic -- Presbyterian Principles -- and twenty other Things. Our Sentiments were heard in Congress, with great Caution -- and seemed to make but little Impression: but the longer We sat, the more clearly they saw the Necessity of pursuing vigorous Measures. It has been so now. Every Day We sit, the more We are convinced that the Designs against Us, are hostile and sanguinary, and that nothing but Fortitude, , and Perseverance can save Us. But  America is a great, unwieldy Body. Its Progress must be slow. It is like a large Fleet sailing under Convoy. The fleetest Sailors must wait for the dullest and slowest. Like a Coach and six -- the swiftest Horses must be slackened and the slowest quickened, that all may keep an even Pace. It is long since I heard from you. I fear you have been kept in continual Alarms. My Duty and Love to all. My dear , Johnny, Charly and Tommy come here and kiss me. We have appointed a continental Fast. Millions will be upon their Knees at once before their great Creator, imploring his Forgiveness and Blessing, his Smiles on American Councils and Arms.

","My dear This Letter is to go by my worthy Friend Mr. Stephen Collins of this City. This Gentleman is of Figure and Eminence as well as Fortune in this Place. He is of the  of the Friends, but not stiff nor rigid. He is a Native of  Lynn in  New England, a Brother of Ezra Collins in  Boston, a Nephew of Friend Collins the Apothecary in  Boston. I have been treated by him in this City, both in the former Congress and the present, with unbounded Civility, and Friendship. His House is open to every New Englandman. I never knew a more agreable Instance of Hospitality.

A certain Mr. John Kaighn, (they pronounce his Name Cain) another Quaker of liberal sentiments is in Company with Mr. Collins.

","My Dear I have received your very  Favours of June 22d.  and  25th . They contain more particulars than any Letters I had before received from any Body. It is not at all  to me that the wanton, cruel, and infamous Conflagration of  Charlestown, the Place of your Fathers Nativity, should afflict him. Let him know that I sincerely condole with him, on that melancholly Event. It is a Method of conducting War long since become disreputable among civilized Nations: But every Year brings us fresh Evidence, that We have nothing to hope for from our loving Mother Country, but Cruelties more abominable than those which are practiced by the Savage Indians. The account you give me of the Numbers slain on the side of our Enemies, is affecting to Humanity,  it is a glorious Proof of the Bravery of our Worthy Countrymen. Considering all the Disadvantages under which they fought, they really exhibited Prodigies of Valour. Your Description of the Distresses of the worthy Inhabitants of  Boston, and the other Sea Port Towns, is enough to melt an Heart of stone. Our Consolation must be this, my dear, that Cities may be rebuilt, and a People reduced to Poverty, may acquire fresh Property: But a Constitution of Government once changed from Freedom, can never be restored. Liberty once lost is lost forever. When the People once surrender their share in the Legislature, and their Right of defending the Limitations upon the Government, and of resisting every Encroachment upon them, they can never regain it. The Loss of Mr. Mathers Library, which was a Collection, of Books and Manuscripts made by himself, his Father, his Grandfather, and Greatgrandfather, and was really very curious and valuable, is irreparable. The Family picture you draw is charming indeed. My dear , Johnny,Charly and Tommy, I long to see you, and to share with your Mamma the Pleasures of your Conversation. I feel myself much obliged to Mr. Bowdoin, Mr. Wibirt, and the two Families you mention, for their Civilities to you. My Compliments to them. Does Mr. Wibirt preach against Oppression, and the other Cardinal Vices of the Times? Tell him the Clergy here, of every Denomination, not excepting the Episcopalian, thunder and lighten every sabbath. They pray for  Boston and the  Massachusetts -- they thank God most explicitly and fervently for our remarkable Successes -- they pray for the American Army. They seem to feel as if they were among you. You ask if every Member feels for Us? Every Member says he does -- and most of them really do. But most of them feel more for themselves. In every Society of Men, in every , I ever yet saw, you find some who are timid, their Fears hurry them away upon every Alarm -- some who are selfish and avaricious,on whose callous Hearts nothing but Interest and Money can make Impression. There are some Persons in  New York and  Philadelphia, to whom a ship is dearer than a City, and a few Barrells of flower, than a thousand Lives -- other Mens Lives I mean. You ask, can they  what We suffer? I answer No. They cant, they don't -- and to excuse them as well as I can, I must confess I should not be able to do it, myself, if I was not more acquainted with it by Experience than they are. I am grieved for Dr. Tufts's ill Health: but rejoiced exceedingly at his virtuous Exertions in the Cause of his Country. I am happy to hear that my Brothers were at  Grape Island and behaved well. My Love to them, and Duty to my Mother. It gives me more Pleasure than I can express to learn that you sustain with so much Fortitude, the Shocks and Terrors of the Times. You are really brave, my dear, you are an Heroine. And you have Reason to be. For the worst that can happen, can do you no Harm. A soul, as pure, as benevolent, as virtuous and pious as yours has nothing to fear, but every Thing to hope and expect from the last of human Evils. Am glad you have secured an ,tho I hope you will not have occasion for it. Love to  and sister and the Children. There is an amiable, ingenious Hussy, named Betcy Smith, for whom I have a very great Regard. Be pleased to make my Love acceptable to her, and let her know, that her elegant Pen cannot be more usefully employed than in Writing Letters to her Brother at  Phyladelphia, tho it may more agreably in writing Billet doux to young Gentlemen. The other Day, after I had received a Letter of yours, with one or two others, Mr. William Barrell desired to read them. I put them into his Hand, and the next Morning had them returned in a large Bundle packed up with two great Heaps of Pins, with a very polite Card requesting  Acceptance of them. I shall bring them with me  [when] I return: But when that will be is uncertain. -- I hope not more than a Month hence. I have really had a very  Time of it. My Health and especialy my Eyes have been so very bad, that I have not been so fit for Business as I ought, and if I had been in perfect Health, I should have had in the present Condition of my Country and my Friends, no Taste for Pleasure. But Dr. Young has made a kind of Cure of my Health and Dr. Church of my Eyes. Have received two kind Letters from your   Smith -- do thank him for them -- I shall forever love him for them. I love every Body that writes to me.  "

","My Dear About five O Clock this Morning, I went with young Dr. Bond at his Invitation and in his Carriage, to his Fathers Seat in the Country. His Mother, with three of her , little Girls, resides here. The old Lady has lately lost two of her Children grown up, and as she cannot forget them, retires to this little Box, to indulge or aswage her Grief. The House is only one small room, with one Chamber over it. But the Farm is large, the Gardens very spacious, the orchards noble, and the Fruit Trees, very numerous and of great Variety. Noble Rowes of poplar Trees, in  Europe they are called Tulip Trees, a more noble and beautifull Tree, than our Lime Trees. The House stands upon the highest Land, that is any where to be found in the Neighbourhood of this City. The Prospect round it is rural, very spacious and very agreable. The Air is very pure. We breakfasted, upon balm Tea and Bread and Butter. A most  and refreshing Excursion We had, and such Excursions are very necessary to preserve our Health, amidst the suffocating Heats of the City, and the wasting, exhausting Debates of the Congress. This young Dr. Bond is above thirty, perhaps near forty.  He has lost his Wife, and has two pretty little Girls -- one about Ten Years old who sings most sweetly and dances, delightfully. He is the Tom Brattle of  Philadelphia -- fat and jolly, a Lover of Pleasure, educated at the Colledge here, has been in Trade, and sunk his father five or six thousand Pounds sterling, and then returned to the Study and practice of Physic. Wine and Women he uses very freely. There is a pretty Girl, in a Chamber opposite to his Lodgings in the City, whom with whom he is supposed to have Connections. -- Epicurism and Debauchery, are more common in this Place than in  Boston. I never observe in the World, an Example, of any Person brought to Poverty from Affluence, from Health to Distemper, from Fame to Disgrace by the Vices and Follies of the age, but it throws me into a deep Rumination upon Education. My poor Children, I fear will loose some Advantages in Point of Education, from my continual Absence from them. Truth, Sobriety, Industry should be  inculcated upon them. Pray my dear, let them be taught Geography and the Art of copying as well as drawing Plans of Cities, Provinces, Kingdoms, and Countries -- especially of  America. I have found great Inconvenience for Want of this Art, since I have had to contemplate  America so much, and since I had to study the Processes and Operations of War. But their , Truth, in one Word their Morals, are of most importance. I hope these will be kept pure. "
July 23 1775,"My Dear You have more than once in your Letters mentioned , and in one intimated a Desire that I should write you something concerning him.  has been very constant in his Attendance on Congress from the Beginning. His Conduct has been my composed and grave and in the Opinion of many Gentlemen very reserved. He has not assumed any Thing, nor affected to take the lead; but has seemed to choose that the Congress should pursue their own Principles and sentiments and adopt their own Plans: Yet he has not been backward: has been very usefull, on many occasions, and discovered a Disposition entirely American. He does not hesitate at our boldest Measures, but rather seems to think us, too irresolute, and backward.  He thinks us at present in an odd State, neither in Peace nor War, neither dependent nor independent. But he thinks that We shall soon assume a Character more decisive. He thinks, that We have the Power of preserving ourselves, and that even if We should be driven to the  Necessity of assuming a total Independency, and set up a separate state, We could maintain it. The People of  England, have thought that the Opposition in  America, was wholly owing to Dr. Franklin: and I suppose their scribblers will attribute the Temper, and Proceedings of this Congress to him: but there cannot be a greater Mistake. He has had but little share farther than to co operate and assist. He is however a great and good Man.  [illegible]   I wish his Colleagues from this City were All like him,  particularly one, whose Abilities and Virtues, formerly trumpeted so much in  America, have been found wanting. There is a young Gentleman from   whose Name is Wilson, whose Fortitude, Rectitude, and Abilities too, greatly outshine his Masters. Mr. Biddle, the Speaker, has been taken off, by Sickness. Mr. Mifflin is gone to the Camp, Mr. Morton is ill too, so that this Province has suffered by the Timidity of two overgrown Fortunes. The Dread of Confiscation, or Caprice, I know not what has influenced them too much: Yet they were for taking Arms and pretended to be very valiant. -- This Letter must be secret my dear -- at least communicated with great Discretion.  Yours, "

","My Dear Have only Time to send by this Opportunity a Token of Remembrance. The Fast was observed here with a Decorum and solemnity, never before seen ever on a Sabbath. The Clergy of all Denominations, here preach  and War in a manner that I never heard in  N. England. They are a Flame of Fire. It is astonishing to me, that the People are so cool here. Such sermons in our Country would have a much greater Effect. I hope to see you eer long. You have stirred up my Friends to write to me.Austin, Tudor, Rice have wrote. Dr. Tufts wrote me an excellent Letter and very particular Intelligence. I am yours &c.  "

The Business I have had upon my Mind has been as great and important as can be intrusted to  Man, and the Difficulty and Intricacy of it is prodigious. When 50 or 60 Men have a Constitution to form for a great Empire, at the same Time that they have a Country of fifteen hundred Miles extent to fortify, Millions to arm and train, a Naval Power to begin, an extensive Commerce to regulate, numerous Tribes of Indians to negotiate with, a standing Army of Twenty seven Thousand Men to raise, pay,of victual and officer, I really shall pity those 50 or 60 Men.I must see you e'er long. -----Rice, has wrote me a very good Letter, and so has Thaxter, for which I thank them both.

","My Dear Your two last Letters had very different Effects. The long one gave me vast Satisfaction. It was full of  Information, and of excellent Sentiments. The other relating to the ill Usage you have received from Hayden gave me great Pain and the utmost indignation. Your generous Solicitude for our unfortunate Friends from  Boston, is very amiable and commendable, and you may depend upon my Justification of all that you have done or said to Hayden. His , insolent Tongue is well known to me, but I had rather he should indulge it to me than to you. I will not endure the least disrespectfull Expression to you. In my Absence and in your Situation, it is brutal. I send you a Warning to him to go out of the House immediately. You may send it to him, if you see fit. If you do, let two or three Witnesses see it, before you send it, and let it be sent by a good Hand. This Letter will go by four young Gentlemen from  Maryland. Mr. Cary, Son of Mr. Sam.

","My dear, This Letter is intended to go by my Friend Mr. William Barrell, whom I believe you have seen in  Boston. If he calls at our House you will please to receive him complaisantly and thank him for your Present of Pins. I have been treated by him with great Civility, both at this and the former Congress. This Day, I have heard my Parish Priest, Mr. Duffill from 2. Chron. 15 1. 2. This Gentleman never fails to adapt his Discourse to the Times. He pressed upon his Audience the Necessity of Piety and Virtue, in the present Times of Adversity, and held up to their View the Army before  Boston as an Example. He understood, he said, that the Voice of the Swearer was  heard, that the Sabbath was well observed and all Immoralities discountenanced. No doubt there were vicious Individuals, but the general  Character was good. -- I hope this good Mans Information is true, and that this will become more and more the true Character of that Camp. You may well suppose that this Language was exceedingly pleasing to me. We have nothing new, but the Arrival of some Powder. Three little  have certainly arrived, making about Ten Tons in the whole, and four or five Tons have arrived from  S. Carolina. A Supply, I think now We shall certainly obtain. Congress have taken Measures for this End, which I hope to have the Pleasure of explaining to you in Person, within a few Days, as Congress has determined to adjourn to sometime in September. I could not vote for this myself because I thought it might be necessary to keep together, but I could not blame those who did, for really We have been all so assiduous in Business, in this exhausting debilitating Climate, that our Lives are more exposed than they would be in Camp.  "

","My Dear This is the first Time, that I have attempted to write, since I left you. I arrived here in good Health, after an  journey,  [illegible]   last Wednesday; There had not been Members enough to make a House, several Colonies being absent, so that I was just in Time. The next day, an adequate No. appeared, and Congress has sat ever since. Georgia is now fully represented, and united to the other Twelve. Their Delegates are Dr. Zubly, a Clergyman of the  Perswasion who has a Parish in that Colony and a good deal of Property. He is a Native of  Switzerland, is a Man of Learning and Ingenuity. It is said he is Master of several Languages, Greek, Latin, French, Dutch and English.  In the latter it is said, he writes tolerably. He is a Man of Zeal and Spirit, as We have already seen upon several occasions. However, as he is the first Gentleman of the Cloth who has appeared in Congress, I can not but wish he may be the last. Mixing the sacred Character, with that of the Statesman, as it is quite unnecessary at this Time of day, in these Colonies, is not attended with any good Effects. The Clergy are universally too little acquainted with the World, and the Modes of Business, to engage in civil affairs with any Advantage. Besides those of them, who are really Men of Learning, have conversed with Books so much more than Men, as to be too much loaded with Vanity, to be good Politicians. Mr. Bullock is another of the Georgian Delegates, a sensible Man, a Planter I suppose. Mr. Houstoun is the third, a young Lawyer  of Modesty as well as sense and Spirit which you will say is uncommon. Mr. Jones and Dr. Hall are not yet arrived. Mr. Henry is made a General in  Virginia, and therefore could not come. Mr. Pendleton and Coll. Bland excused  on Account of Age and ill Health.Messrs. Nelson, Wythe, and Lee, are chosen and are here in the Stead of the other three.Wythe and Lee are inoculated. You shall hear more about them. Altho they come in the Room of very good Men, We have lost nothing by the Change I believe. Remember me in the tenderest Language, to all our little Folks. --  I am yours.  "

","My Dear I have not written the usual Compliment of Letters since I left  Braintree; nor have I received one Scratch of a Pen from any Body, till the last Evening, when the Post brought me a Line from Mrs. Warren, in which she informs me that you had been ill, but was better. I shall be unhappy till I hear farther from you,  I hope for the best. I have enjoyed better Health, this session than the last, and have suffered less  from certain Fidgets, Pidlings, and Irritabilities which have become so famous. A more serious Spirit prevails than heretofore. We shall soon be in Earnest. I begin to think We are so. Our Injunctions of Secrecy are so much insisted on, that I must be excused from disclosing one Iota of any Thing that comes to my Knowledge as a Member of the Congress. Our journal of the last session however, I conjecture will be speedily printed and then I will inclose it to you. I want to be informed from Hour to Hour, of any Thing which passes in  Boston -- whether our Friends come out -- what Property they bring? -- how they fare in Town? How the Tories subsist &c. &c. &c. Whether the Troops are healthy or sickly? I also want to know every Thing which passes in our Army. The Feats and Exploits of our little Naval Armaments would be very agreable.  is made easy. He must keep a Clerk, or there will be Jealousies. Indeed it is his Duty for it is impossible he can do the Business himself, and if that is not done, Injustice to the public will be done.

It is as pretty an Amusement, as Dancing or Skaiting, or Fencing, after they have once acquired a Taste for them. No doubt you are well qualified for a school Mistress in these Studies, for Stephen Collins tells me the English Gentleman, in Company with him, when he visited  Braintree, pronounced you the most accomplished Lady, he had seen since he left  England. -- You see a Quaker can flatter, but dont you be proud. My best Wishes and most fervent Prayers attend our little Family. I have been banished from them, the greatest Part of the last Eighteen Months but I hope to be with them more, in Time to come. I hope to be excused from attending at  Philadelphia, after the Expiration of the Year. I hope that Dr. Winthrop, Mr. Sever, Mr. Greenleaf, Coll. Warren, Mr. Hawley, Mr. Gerry, some or all of them will take their Turns, in the States -- and suffer me, at least to share with my Family, a little more than I have done, the Pleasures and Pains of this Life, and that I may attend a little more to my private Affairs that I may not be involved in total Ruin, unless my Country should be so and then I should choose to share its Fate.  "
"Philadelphia  Octr. 1 1775
","My Dear This Morning, I received your two Letters of September 8th. and September 16th. -- What shall I say? -- The Intelligence they contain, came upon me by , as I never had the least Intimation before, that any of my Family was ill, excepting in a Card from Mrs. Warren received a few days ago, in which she informed me that Mrs. Adams had been unwell but was better. You may easily conceive the State of Mind, in which I am at present. -- Uncertain and apprehensive, at first I suddenly thought of setting off, immediately, for  Braintree, and I have not yet determined otherwise. Yet the State of public Affairs is so critical, that I am half afraid to leave my Station,  my Presence here is of no great Consequence. I feel -- I tremble for You. Poor Tommy! I hope by this Time, however, he has recovered his plump Cheeks and his fine Bloom. By your Account of Patty I fear -- but still I will hope she has been supported, and is upon the Recovery. I rejoice to learn that Nabby and her Brothers have hitherto escaped and pray God that his Goodness may be still continued to them. Your Description of the distressed State of the  is affecting indeed. It is not uncommon for a Train of Calamities to come together. Fire, Sword, Pestilence, Famine, often keep Company, and visit a Country in a Flock. At this Distance I can do no good to you nor yours. I pray God to support you -- I hope our Friends and  are kind as usual. I feel for them, in the general Calamity. I am so far from thinking you , that I am charmed with that Admirable Fortitude, and that divine Spirit of Resignation which appears in your Letters. I cannot express the Satisfaction it gives me, nor how much it contributes to support me. You have alarmed me however, by mentioning Anxieties   which you do not think it prudent to mention to any one. I am wholly at a Loss to conjecture what they can be. If they arise from the Letters be assured that you may banish them forever. These Letters have reached Philadelphia, but have produced Effects very different from those which were expected from the Publication of them. These Effects I will explain to you sometime or other. As to the Versification of them, if there is Wit or Humour in it laugh -- if ill Nature, sneer -- if mere Dullness, why you may even yawn or not nod. I have no Anger, at it, nay even scarcly contempt. It is impotent. As to , We have nothing to expect but the whole Wrath and Force of  G. Britain. But your Words are as true as an oracle ""God helps them, who help them selves, and if We obtain the divine Aid by our own Virtue, Fortitude and Perseverance, We may be sure of Relief."" It may amuse you to hear a Story. A few days ago, in Company with Dr. Zubly, somebody said, there was nobody on our side but the Almighty. The Dr. who is a Native of  Switzerland, and speaks but broken English, quickly replied ""Dat is enough. -- Dat is enough,"" and turning to me, says he, it puts me in mind of a fellow who once said, The  have on their side the Pope, and the K. of France and the K. of Spain, and the K. of Sardinia, and the K. of Poland and the Emperor of Germany &c. &c. &c. But as to them poor Devils the Protestants, they have nothing on their side but God Almighty.  "
"Philadelphia Sept.Octr. 2, 1775
","My Dear Every Thing here is in as good a Way as I could wish, considering the Temper and Designs of Administration. I assure you, the Letters have had no such bad Effects, as the Tories intended, and as some of our shortsighted  apprehended: so far otherwise that I see and hear every day, fresh Proofs that every Body is coming fast into every political Sentiment contained in them. I assure you I could mention compliments passed upon them: and if a serious Decision could be had upon them, the public Voice would be found in their Favour. But I am distressed with Cares of another Kind. Your two Letters are never out of my Thoughts. I should have mounted my Horse this day for  Braintree, if I had not hopes of hearing further from you in a Day or two. However, I will hope that your Prospects are more  agreable than they were, and that the Children are all better as well as the rest of the Family and the Neighbours. If I should hear more disagreable Advices from you I shall certainly come home, for I cannot leave you, in such Affliction, without endeavouring to lessen it, unless there was an absolute Necessity of my staying here, to do a Duty to the Public, which I think there is not. I must beg to be excused my dear from  any Thing for the future of public Persons or Things. Secrecy is so much exacted: But thus much I can say, that I never saw so serious and determined a Spirit. I must also beseech you to be cautious what you write to me and by whom you send. Letters sent to the Care of Coll. Warren, will come Safe. My Regards with all proper Distinctions to my Relations and yours, my Friends and yours, my Acquaintances and yours. This will go by Major Bayard, a Gentleman of the Presbyterian  in this City, of excellent Character to whom I am indebted for a great many Civilities.  "
"Philadelphia  Octr. 7th. 1775
","My Dear Yesterday, by the Post, I received yours of  25th., and it renewed a Grief and Anxiety, that was before almost removed from my Mind. Two days before I had the Pleasure of a very valuable Letter from Coll. Quincy, in which he kindly informed me that you and our Family were so much better that you and my dear Nabby, had made a Visit at his House: and Mr. Williams, who brought the Letter acquainted me that he had been to  Braintree after the Date of it, that you was in good Spirits, that Tommy was so much better as to be playing about abroad, and that he hoped Patty was not dangerous: you will easily believe that this Information gave me great Pleasure and fine Spirits: It really relieved me from a heavy Load: But your last Letter has revived my Concern. -- I will still hope however that your excellent Mother will yet be spared for a Blessing to her Family and an Example to the World. I build my Hopes of her Recovery, upon the Advantage of a Constitution which has hitherto sustained so many Attacks and upon a long Course of exact Temperance which I hope has deprived the Distemper of its most dangerous food and Fuel. -- However, our Lives are not in our own Power. It is our Duty to submit. -- ""The Ways of Heaven are dark and intricate."" Its designs are often inscrutable, But are always wise and just and good. It was long before I had the least Intimation of the Distress of the Family, and I fear, that your not receiving so many Letters from me as usual may have been one Cause of Infelicity to you. -- Really, my dear, I have been more cautious than I used to be. It is not easy to know whom to trust, in these times, and if a Letter from any Person in the situation I am in, can be laid hold of, there are so many Lies made and told about it, so many false Copies taken and dispersed, and so many false Constructions put, that one ought to be cautious. The Situation of Things, is so alarming, that it is our Duty to prepare our Minds and Hearts for every Event, even the Worst. From my earliest Entrance into Life, I have been engaged in the public Cause of  America: and from first to last I have had upon my Mind, a strong Impression, that Things would be wrought up to their present Crisis. I saw from the Beginning that the Controversy was of such a Nature that it never would be settled, and every day convinces me more and more. This has been the source of all the Disquietude of my Life. It has lain down and rose up with me these twelve Years. The Thought that we might be driven to the sad Necessity of breaking our Connection with  G.B. exclusive of the Carnage and Destruction which it was easy to see must attend the , always gave me a great deal of Grief. And even now, I would chearfully retire from public life forever, renounce all Chance for Profits or Honours from the public, nay I would chearfully contribute my little Property to obtain Peace and Liberty. -- But all these must go and my Life too before I can surrender the Right of my Country to a free Constitution. I dare not consent to it. I should be the most miserable of Mortals ever after, whatever Honours or Emoluments might surround me.  "
"Octr. 10, 1775","I am much concerned least you should feel an Addition to your Anxieties, from your having so seldom heard from me. But I pray you to dismiss all Concern about me. I am happier far than I was before the Adjournment. My Health is better, and Business and Conversation are much more to my Taste. The  Intelligence We have in private Letters concerning the Director of the Hospital, has made me more cautious of Writing than ever. I must be excused from writing a Syllable of any Thing of any Moment. My Letters have been and will be nothing, but Trifles. I dont  [choose] to trust the Post. I am afraid to trust private Travellers. They may peep. Accidents may happen, and I would avoid, if I could, even Ridicule, but especially Mischief. Pray, bundle up every Paper, not already hid, and conceal them in impenetrable Darkness. Nobody knows what may occur. My Love to those who are dearest to us both. Send yours to the Care of the Gentleman whose Care has hitherto been . Date them in Time, but not Place, and assume a new fictitious Name.  "
Octr. 13. 1775,"I this day received  yours of the 29 of September , and the  1st of October.  Amidst all your Afflictions, I am greatly rejoiced to find that you all along preserve so proper and so happy a Temper -- that you are sensible  ""the Consolations of Religion are the only sure Comforters."" It is the Constitution under which We are born that if We live long ourselves We must bury our Parents and all our Elder Relatives and many of those who are younger. I have lost a Parent, a Child and a Brother, and each of them left a lasting Impression on my Mind: But, you and I have  more Relations, and very good Friends to follow to the House  [appointed] for all Flesh, or else We must be followed by them. -- In your last you make no Mention of Patty, poor distress'd Girl! I fear the next News I shall hear will be of her Departure, yet I will hope, that Youth, and a strong Constitution which has lasted so long will finally survive. If not We must submit. I bewail more than I can express, the Loss of your excellent Mother. I mourn the Loss of so much Purity, and unaffected Piety and Virtue to the World. I know of no better Character left in it. I grieve for you, and your Brother, and sisters, I grieve for your Father, whose Age will need the  of so excellent a Companion. But I grieve for nobody more than my Children, and Brothers Smiths and Mr. Cranch's. Her most amiable, and discreet Example, as well as her Kind Skill and Care I have ever relyed upon in my own Mind, for the Education of  these little Swarms. Not that I have not a proper Esteem for the Capacity and Disposition of the Mothers, but I know that the Efforts of the Grandmother, are of great Importance, when they second those of the Parent. And I am sure that my Children are the better for the forming Hand of their Grandmother. It gives me great joy to learn that ours are well -- let us be  for this and many other Blessings yet granted us. Pray my dear cherish in the Minds of my Nabby and Johnny and Charly and Tommy the Remembrance of their Grand mamma, and remind them of her Precepts and Example. God almighty grant to you and to every Branch of the Family, all the Support that you want! You and I, my dear, have Reason, if ever Mortals had, to be  -- to look forward beyond the transitory Scene. Whatever is preparing for Us, let us be prepared to receive. It is Time for Us to subdue our Passions of every Kind. The Prospect before Us is an Ocean of Uncertainties, in which no pleasing objects appear. We have few Hopes, excepting that of preserving our Honour and our Consciences untainted and a free Constitution to our Country. Let me be sure of these, and amidst all my Weaknesses, I cannot be overcome. With these I can be happy, in extream Poverty, in humble Insignificance, nay I hope and believe, in Death: without them I should be miserable, with a Crown upon my Head, Millions in my Coffers, and a gaping, idolizing Multitude at my Feet. -- My Heart is too full of Grief for you and our Friends to whom I wish you to present my Regards, to say any Thing of News or Politicks. Yet the Affair of the surgeon general is so strange, and important an Event that I cannot close this gloomy Letter, without adding a Sigh for this imprudent unfortunate Man! I know not whether the Evidence will support the Word Treachery, but what may We not expect after Treachery to himself, his Wife and Children!   "
"Octr: 19, 1775","My Dear It is  some Time since I wrote you, and I have nothing, now,nothing to write but Repetitions of Respect and Affection.-- I am anxious to hear from you. I hope, the Family is better, and that your Grief for the great Loss We have all sustained is somewhat abated. I hope your Father and Sister Betcy, are well, tho they must be greatly afflicted. Give my Love to Betcy, and let her know that I feel, most intimately for her, as well as for myself, and the rest. I consider the Stroke must fall heavier upon her, as it was nearer to her. Her Prosperity is near my Heart -- I wish her every Blessing which she can possibly wish for herself. Really it is very  to be 400 Miles from ones Family and Friends when We know they are in Affliction. It seems as if It would be a joy to me to fly home, even to share with you your Burdens and Misfortunes. Surely, if I were with you, it would be my Study to allay your Griefs, to mitigate your Pains and to divert your melancholly Thoughts. When I shall come home I know not. We have so much to do, and it is so difficult to do it right, that We must learn Patience. Upon my Word I think, if ever I were to come here again, I must bring you with me. I could live here pleasantly if I had you, with me. Will you come and have the small Pox here? I wish I could remove all the Family, our little Daughter and Sons, and all go through the Distemper here.-- What if We should? Let me please myself with the Thought however. Congress has appointed Mr. Wythe, Mr. Deane and me, a Committee to collect an Account of the Hostilities committed by the Troops and Ships, with proper Evidence of the Number and Value of the Houses and other Buildings destroyed or damaged, the  captivated and the Cattle, Sheep, Hogs &c. taken. We are about writing to all the general assemblies of  New England, and to many private Gentlemen in each Collony to assist Us in making the Collections. The Gentlemen with me are able Men. Deane's Character you know. He is a very ingenious Man and an able Politician. Wythe is a new Member from  Virginia, a Lawyer of the highest Eminence in that Province, a learned and very laborious Man: so that We may hope this Commission will be well executed. A Tale of Woe it will be! Such a scene of Distress, and Destruction and so patiently and magnanimously born. Such a Scene of Cruelty and Barbarity, so unfeelingly committed. -- I mention this to you my dear, that you may look up and transmit to me a Paper, which Coll. Palmer lent me containing a Relation of the Charlestown Battle, which was transmitted to England by the Committee of Safety. This Paper I must have, or a Copy of it. I wish I could collect from the People of  Boston or others, a proper Set of Paintings of the Scenes of Distress and Misery, brought upon that Town from the Commencement of the Port Bill. Posterity must hear a Story that shall make their Ears to Tingle. "
"October 21, 1775","My Dear This Letter will go by two Gentlemen, who are travelling to your Country, for the Sake of acquiring military Knowledge. The Name of one of them is Mr. John Folwell and the other Mr. Josiah Hart. Each of them is the Captain of a Company of Militia in their Country, which is no small  here. Captn. Hart is the Son of a Mr. Joseph Hart of  Warminster in the County of Bucks in this Province, whose benevolent disposition has led him to exert himself, zealously to gather Collections of Money and other Things for the Relief of our Friends in  Boston, and whose Character and Influence, has enabled him to do it with Success. These Travellers are visiting the Camp for the Sake of gaining military Knowledge by Experience, that their Country may have the Benefit of it whenever there shall be Occasion to call it forth. I dont know that they will visit  Braintree. If they should I hope you will treat them with as much Civility as your Circumstances will admit. We have had a Calm for a long Time, but expect the Weather will change very soon. Remember me to all. My Duty to your Father, with my best Wishes for his Support under his severe Affliction.  "
"Octr. 23, 1775","Yesterday  yours of Octr. 9th.  came to Hand. Your Letters never failed to give me Pleasure -- the greatest Pleasure that I take, is in receiving them. And  every one, which has yet come to Hand is replete with melancholly Tidings, yet I can truly say I never was so earnest to receive them. I rejoice in the happy Principles and the happy Temper, in which apparently dictated them all. I feel myself much affected with the Breach upon the Family. But We can count a Mother, a Brother, an Aunt, and a Brothers Child among the slain by this cruel Pestilence. May God almighty put a stop to its Rage, and humble us under the Ravages already made by it. The sorrows of all our Friends on the Loss of your Mother are never out of my Mind. I pray God to spare my Parent whose Life has been prolonged by his Goodness hitherto, as well as yours that survives. The tremendous Calamities already felt of Fire, Sword and Pestilence, may be only Harbingers of greater still. We have no security against Calamities here -- this Planet is its Region. The only Principle is to be prepared for the worst Events. If I could write as well as you, my sorrows would be as eloquent as yours, but upon my Word I cannot. The unaccountable Event which you allude to has reached this Place and occasioned a Fall. I would be glad however that the worst Construction might not be put. Let him have fair Play --  I doubt. The Man who violates private Faith,  solemn Obligations, whom neither Honour nor Conscience holds, shall never be knowingly trusted by me. Had I known, when I first voted for a Director of an Hospital, what I heard afterwards when I was down, I would not have voted as I did. Open barefaced Immorality ought not to be so countenanced. Tho I think, a Fatality attends us in some Instances, yet a divine Protection and favour is visible in others, and let us be chearfull whatever happens. Chearfullness is not a sin in any Times. I am afraid to hear again almost least some other should be sick in the House. Yet I hope better, and that you will reassume your  Chearfullness and write again upon News and Politics. Send your Letters to Warren for Conveyance. I wont trust any other.  "
Octr. 28. 1775,"My dear The Fall of , has given me many disagreable Reflections, as it places human Nature itself in a Point of bad Light, but the Virtue, the sincerity, the Honour, of  Boston and  Massachusetts Patriots in a worse. -- What shall We say of a Country which produces such Characters as Hutchinson and Church? -- However to turn my Attention from this detestible Subject to another more agreable. Congress has appointed instead of Church, Dr. Morgan of this City whose Character I will pourtray for your Satisfaction. The Gentleman appointed Director and surgeon general of the Hospital, is John Morgan M.D. Fellow of the Royal Society at  London; Correspondent of the Royal Academy of Surgery at  Paris; Member of the Arcadian Belles Lettres Society at  Rome; Licentiate of the Royal  of Physicians in  London and in  Edinburgh; and Professor of the Theory and Practice of Medicine in the Colledge of  Philadelphia. This Gentleman was one of the first who received their Education in the  in this City, and served an Apprenticeship of six Years with Dr. John Redman an eminent Phisician, here, during one whole Year of which he put up the Prescriptions of all the Phisicians  who attended the public Hospital here, who were all eminent. After this the Dr. entered the Army and served four Years under Generals Moncton,Forbes and Stanwix, where he had an entensive Practice, in the Army among all Kinds of Diseases. Five years after, he left the Army he spent in  Europe, under the most celebrated Masters in every Branch of Medicine. During this Period he visited the principal Seat Cities and Seats of Science in  Great Britain,  Holland,  France and  Italy. Returning from his Travels, he was chosen Professor of Medicine in the  in this City, where he has constantly read Lectures every Winter, and for many Years practiced among the Citizens. Dr. Morgans moral Character is very good, and his manners are civil, decent, and . He married a sister of the Lady of our Chaplain, Mr. Dushe, who is new Rector of the three united Churches in this City. A sister of the Doctors is married to Mr. Stillman the Antipaedobaptist lately in  Boston, now in this Place. Thus I hope We shall hear no Complaint that this Place is not now well filled. Jealousy and Envy spare nobody. Some have whispered that the Dr. is a little Visionary in Theory and Practice. But all agree that he is attentive, vigilant and laborious for the good of his Patients in a great Degree, and he is said to be a pious Man.  "
"Octr. 29, 1775","I cannot exclude from my Mind your  Situation. The Griefs of your Father and Sisters, your Uncles and Aunts, as well as the remoter Connections, often croud in upon me, when my whole Attention ought to be directed to other Subjects. Your Uncle Quincy, my Friend as well as Uncle, must regret the loss of a beloved Sister,  my other Friend I know bewails the loss of a Friend, as well as an Aunt and a sister, Mr. Cranch the Friend of my youth as well as of my riper Years, whose tender Heart sympathizes with his fellow Creatures in every Affliction and Distress, in this Case feels the Loss of a Friend, a fellow Christian, and a Mother. But alas what avail these  Reflections. The best Thing We can do, the greatest Respect We can show to the Memory of our departed Friend, is to copy into Our own Lives, those Virtues which in her Lifetime rendered her the Object of our Esteem, Love and Admiration. I must confess I ever felt a Veneration for her, which seems increased by the News of her Translation. Above all Things my dear, let us inculcate these great  Virtues and bright Excellencies upon our Children. Your Mother had a clear, and penetrating Understanding and a Sound profound judgment, as well as an honest and a friendly and a charitable Heart. There is one Thing however, which you will forgive me if I hint to you. Let me ask you rather, if you are not of my opinion? Were not her Talents, and Virtues too much confined, to private, social and domestic Life. My Opinion of the Duties of Religion and Morality, comprehends a very extensive Connection with society at large, and the great Interest of the public. Does not natural Morality, and much more Christian Benevolence, make it our  Duty to lay ourselves out, to serve our fellow Creatures to the Utmost of our Power, in promoting and supporting those great Political systems, and general Regulations upon which the Happiness of Multitudes depends. The Benevolence, Charity, Capacity and Industry which exerted in private Life, would make a family, a Parish or a Town Happy, employed upon a larger Scale, in Support of the great Principles of Virtue and Freedom of political Regulations might secure whole Nations and Generations from Misery, Want and Contempt. Public Virtues, and political Qualities therefore should be incessantly cherished in our Children. "
"Octr. 29, 1775","There is, in the human Breast, a social Affection, which extends to our whole Species. Faintly indeed; but in some degree. The Nation, Kingdom, or Community to which We belong is embraced by it more vigorously. It is stronger still towards the Province to which we belong, and in which We had our Birth. It is stronger and stronger, as We descend to the County, Town, Parish, , and Family, which We call our own. -- And here We find it often so powerfull as to become partial, to blind our Eyes, to darken our Understandings and pervert our Wills. It is to this Infirmity, in my own Heart, that I must perhaps attribute that local Attachment, that partial Fondness, that overweening Prejudice in  of  New England, which I feel very often and which I fear sometimes, leads me to expose myself to just Ridicule. New England has in many Respects the Advantage of every other Colony in  America, and indeed of every other Part of the World, that I know any Thing of. 1. The People are purer English Blood, less mixed with Scotch, Irish, Dutch, French, Danish,  &c. than any other; and descended from Englishmen too who left  Europe, in purer Times than the present and less tainted with Corruption than those they left behind them. 2. The Institutions in  New England for the Support of Religion, Morals and Decency, exceed any other, obliging every Parish to have a Minister, and every Person to go to Meeting &c. 3. The public Institutions in  New England for the Education of Youth, supporting  at the public Expence and obliging Towns to maintain Grammar schools, is not equalled and never was in any Part of the World. 4. The Division of our Territory, that is our Counties into Townships, empowering Towns to assemble, choose officers, make Laws, mend roads, and twenty other Things, gives every Man an opportunity of  and improving that Education which he received at Colledge or at school, and makes Knowledge and Dexterity at public Business common. 5. Our Laws for the Distribution of Intestate Estates occasions a frequent Division of landed Property and prevents Monopolies, of  Land. But in opposition to these We have  under many Disadvantages. The exorbitant Prerogatives of our Governors &c. which would have overborn our Liberties, if it had not been opposed by the five preceding Particulars.  "

 [Philadelphia],  29 October
","Human nature with all its infirmities and depravation is still capable of great things. It is capable of attaining to degrees of wisdom and of goodness, which, we have reason to believe, appear respectable in the estimation of superior intelligences. Education makes a greater difference between man and man, than nature has made between man and brute. The virtues and powers to which men may be trained, by early education and constant discipline, are truly sublime and astonishing. Newton and Locke are examples of the deep sagacity which may be acquired by long habits of thinking and study. Nay, your common mechanics and artisans are proofs of the wonderful dexterity acquired by use; a watchmaker, in finishing his wheels and springs, a pin or needlemaker, &c. I think there is a particular occupation in  Europe, which is called a paper -- stainer or linen -- stainer. A man who has been long habituated to it, shall sit for a whole day, and draw upon paper fresh figures to be imprinted upon the papers for rooms, as fast as his eye can roll, and his fingers move, and no two of his  shall be alike. The Saracens, the Knights of  Malta, the army and navy in the service of the English republic, among many others, are instances to show, to what an exalted height valor or bravery or courage may be raised, by artificial means. It should be your care, therefore, and mine, to elevate the minds of our children and exalt their courage; to accelerate and animate their industry and activity; to excite in them an habitual contempt of meanness, abhorrence of injustice and inhumanity, and an ambition to a excel in  every capacity, faculty, and virtue. If we suffer their minds to grovel and creep in infancy, they will grovel all their lives. But their bodies must be hardened, as well as their souls exalted. Without strength and activity and vigor of body, the brightest mental excellencies will be eclipsed and obscured.  "
"Novr. 4, 1775","Have but Yesterday received  yours of  21 . Your Letters of the following Dates I have received.  Septr. 8. and 10.  16. 29.   Oct. 1.   9.   21.   22.  These Letters and indeed every Line from you, gives me inexpressible Pleasure, notwithstanding the melancholly Scenes discribed of in most of them of late. I am happy to learn that the Family is in Health once more, and hope it will continue. My Duty to my Mother.  I wish she would not be concerned about me. She ought to consider that a Dissentery can kill as surely as a Cannon. This Town is as secure from the Cannon and Men of War as the Moon is. I wish she had a little of your Fortitude. I had rather be kill'd by a Ball than live in such continual Fears as she does. I cant write so often as I wish: I am engaged from 7 in the Morning till 11 at Night. Two Pair of  belonging to the Seventh Regiment, were brought here last night from Chambly, and hung up in Mrs. Hancocks Chamber with great Splendor and Elegance. That Lady sends her Compliments and good Wishes. Among an hundred Men, almost at this House she lives and behaves with Modesty, Decency, Dignity and Discretion I assure you. Her Behaviour is easy and genteel. She avoids talking upon Politicks. In large and mixed Companies she is totally silent, as a Lady ought to be -- but whether her Eyes are so penetrating and her Attention so quick, to the Words, Looks, Gestures, sentiments &c. of the Company, as yours would be, saucy as you are this Way, I wont say. But to resume a more serious subject. You ask me to write to your Father and sister, and my Heart wishes and longs to do it, but you can have no Conception, what there is to prevent me. I really fear I shall ruin myself for Want of Exercise.  "
Novr. 12. 1775,"My Dear I am often afraid you will think it hard that I dont write oftener to you. But it is really impossible. Could I follow the Inclinations of my Heart I should spend half my Time, in this most  and pleasing Employment: But Business presses me so close that I am necessitated to mortify my self. From 7 to ten in the Committees and from six to ten in the Evening in the same, and from 10 to four in Congress. Many Letters to write too upon Business. As to News, you have every Thing in the public Papers, which I am not now under the strongest Ties of , Virtue and Love of my Country to keep secret, and not to divulge directly or indirectly. I am most earnestly desirous to come home, but when I shall get Leave I know not. I long to write to your Excellent Father and sisters, but cannot get Time. You must have observed, and so must all my Friends that every Letter I write is scratched off in the utmost Haste. How do you like ? He tells me he called at the House and saw you, and that he had the Pleasure of dining with you at his Friend Coll. Quincys. This gave me  [great] Pleasure because I concluded from it [that ]that my dear and most worthy sisters Cranch and  [ . . . ] Betcy were better.  "
"Novr. 15th, 1775","This I suppose will go by Mr. James Bowdoin who has just arrived here from London. He has been very obliging in communicating to me Pamphlets and  in which last I find that some Parts of Novanglus have been retailed out there and have brought on a Battle in the public Papers between Hutchinson and Pounal. Mr. Bowdoin has been to  Italy,  Holland,  France and  England and is returned an honest and warm American. He says to his Astonishment, he found the great American Controversy better understood, and the Consequences of it more clearly foreseen in  France than in  England.  "
November 18. 1775,"Your kind Letter of the 5th.  Inst. came to Hand yesterday by Captain McPherson. I admire your skill in , and your Talent at drawing Characters, as well as that of your Friend Marcia from whom at the same Time I received several important Characters, which you shall one day see. I agree with you in your sentiments that there is Reason to be diffident of a Man who grossly violates the Principles of Morals, in any one particular habitually. This sentiment was conveyed to Us in one of the Paradoxes of the ancient , that ""all sins were equal,"" and the same Idea is suggested from higher Authority, He that violates the Law in any one Instance is guilty of all. I have no Confidence in any Man who is not exact in his Morals. And you know that I look upon Religion as the most perfect System, and the most awfull Sanction of Morality. Your Goodness of Heart, as well as your sound judgment will applaud me for using the utmost Caution in my Letters. But if you could see me, and observe how I am employed you would wonder that I find Time to write to . I am very busy and so is every Body else here. I hope to be with you at Christmas, and then to be excused from coming here again, at least  others have taken their Turns. The late Appointment, you mention gives me many very serious Thoughts.  It is an Office of high Trust, and of vast Importance at any Time: But of greater at this, than any other. The Confusions and Distractions of the Times, will encumber that Office with embarrassments, expose it to dangers and Slanders, which it never knew before. Besides I am apprehensive of other Difficulties. Mr.  [William] Cushing has been on that Bench, and was my senior at the Bar. Will he accept under another?Mr. Paine too has taken an odd Turn in his Head of late, and is so peevish, passionate and violent that he will make the Place disagreable, if he does not think better of it.Mr. Cushing, Mr. Serjeant  [Sargeant] and Mr. Read are very able Men, and Mr. Paine might be so if he wasnot undisturb undisturbed in his Mind. But the Unhappy Affair in his Family, his Church and Town, appears to me to have affected his Mind too much. It is a melancholly Thought to me, because I have ever had a Friendship for him. I am really sorry that he has exposed his Character and Reputation so much of late as he has done, by certain Airs he has given himself, and it has many Times, in the beginning of the summer, when I was in an ill state of Health made me unhappy. But since the Adjournment, I have avoided Altercation with him, and this I shall continue to do. That Ambition and Avarice reign  as you observe, is most true. But I hope that Preferment will follow Merit, after our Affairs get into a more settled Course. Remember me to all. When you said that Kissing goes by , you did not explain the Particulars I wish you had. But all Censure and Clamour at this Time must be avoided and discountenanced as much as possible. I should be glad to be informed, whether the Appointment of me, that you speak of, appears to be to the satisfaction of the People or not. "
"Decr. 3, 1775","My Best Friend   Yours of Novr. 12  is before me. I wish I could write you every day, more than once, for although I have a Number of Friends, and many Relations who are very dear to me, yet all the Friendship I have for others is far unequal to that which warms my Heart for you. The most  Time that I spend here is in writing to you, and conversing with you when I am alone. But the Calls of Friendship and of private Affection must give Place to those of Duty and Honour, even private Friendship and Affections require it. I am obliged by the Nature of the service I am in to correspond with many Gentlemen both of the Army and the two Houses of Assembly which takes up much of my Time. How I find Time to write half the Letters I do, I know not, for my whole Time seems engrossed with Business. The whole Congress is taken up, almost in different Committees from seven to Ten in the Morning -- from Ten to four or sometimes five, we are in Congress and from six to Ten in Committees again. I dont mention this to make you think me a Man of Importance because it is not I alone, but the whole Congress is thus employed, but to  for not writing to you oftener. Indeed I know not what to write that is worth your reading. I send you the Papers, which inform you of what is public. As to what passes in Congress I am tied fast by my Honour to communicate Nothing. I hope the journal of the session will be published soon, and then you will see what We have been about in one View, excepting what ought to be excepted. If I could visit the Coffee Houses, in the Evening and the Coffee Tables of the Ladies in the Afternoon, I could entertain you with many smart Remarks upon Dress and Air, &c. and give you many sprightly Conversations, but my Fate you know is to be moping over Books and Papers, all the Leisure Time I have when I have any. I hope I shall be excused from coming to  Philadelphia again, at least  other Gentlemen have taken their Turns. But I never will come here again without you, if I can perswade you to come with me. Whom God has joined together ought not to be put asunder so long with their own Consent. We will get your Father and sister Betcy to keep House for Us. We will bring Master Johnny with Us, you and he shall have the small Pox here, and We will be as happy, as Mr. Hancock and his Lady. -- Thank Nabby and John for their Letters, and kiss Charles and Tom for me. John  writes like an Hero glowing with Ardor for his Country and burning with Indignation against her Enemies. When I return I will get the sulky back to  New Haven, and there leave it to be repaired, to be brought home by the first Post after it is done. "
"Watertown  Jan. 24. 1776
","My dear   I am determined not to commit a fault which escaped me, the last Time I sat out for the southward. I waited on General Thomas at  Roxbury this Morning, and then went to  Cambridge where I dined at Coll. Mifflins with the General, and Lady, and a vast Collection of other Company, among whom were six or seven Sachems and , of the French Cagnawaga Indians, with several of their Wives and Children. A savage Feast they made of it, yet were very polite in the Indian style. One of these sachems is an Englishman a Native of this Colony whose Name was Williams, captivated in his Infancy with his Mother, and adopted by some  kind Squaw -- another I think is half french Blood. I was introduced to them by the General as one of the grand Council Fire at  Philadelphia which made them prick up their Ears, they came and shook Hands with me, and made me low Bows, and scrapes &c. In short I was much pleased with this Days entertainment. The General is to make them presents in  and Trinketts, they have visited the Lines at  Cambridge and are going to see those at  Roxbury. Tomorrow We mount, for the grand Council Fire -- Where I shall think often of my little Brood at the Foot of Pens Hill. Remember me particularly to , Johnny, Charly and Tommy. Tell them I charge them to be good, honest, active and industrious for their own sakes, as well as ours.  "
"Philadelphia   Feby 11. 1776
","My Dear  Here I am again. Arrived last Thursday, in good Health,  I had a cold Journey. The Weather, a great Part of the Way, was very severe, which prevented our making very quick Progress, and by an Accident which happened to one of my Horses, which obliged me to leave her at  Brookfield and hire another, was delayed two days. An Horse broke loose in the Barn and corked mine under the foreshoulder. I hope that Bass upon his Return will find her well. My Companion was  and made the journey much less tedious than it would have been. I can form no judgment of the State of public Opinions and Principles here, as yet, nor any Conjectures of what an Hour may bring forth. Have been to meeting and heard Mr. Duffill  from Jer. 2.17. Hast thou not procured this unto thy self, in that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, when he led thee by the Way? -- He prayed very earnestly for  Boston and  New York, supposing the latter to be in Danger of Destruction. I, however, am not convinced that  will fire upon that Town -- It has too much Tory Property to be destroyed by Tories. I hope it will be fortified and saved. If not the Q.   may be asked ""hast thou not procured this &c?"" Tomorrow, Dr. Smith is to deliver an oration in  of the brave Montgomery. I will send it, as soon as it is out, to you. There is a deep Anxiety, a kind of  Melancholly, and some a Lowness of Spirits approaching to Despondency, prevailing, through the southern Colonies, at present, very similar, to what I have  often observed in  Boston, particularly on the first News of the Port Bill, and last year about this Time or a little later, when the bad News arrived, which dashed their fond Hopes with which they had deluded themselves, thro the Winter. In this, or a similar Condition, We shall remain, I think, untill late in the Spring, When some critical Event will take Place, perhaps sooner. But the Arbiter of Events, the Sovereign of the World only knows, which Way the Torrent will be turned. Judging by Experience, by Probabilities, and by all Appearances, I conclude, it will roll on to Dominion and Glory, tho the Circumstances and Consequences may be bloody. In such great Changes and Commotions, Individuals are but Atoms. It is  worth while to consider what the Consequences will be to Us. What will be the Effects upon present and future Millions, and Millions of Millions, is a Question very interesting to Benevolence natural and Christian. God grant they may and I firmly believe they will be happy.  "
"Philadelphia  Feby.  [13,] 1776
","Lee is at  , and We have requested a Battalion of Philadelphian Associators, together with a Regiment of Jersey Minute Men, to march to his Assistance. Lord Sterling was there before with his Regiment, so that there will be about 1000 Men with Lee from  Connecticutt, about 600 with Ld. Sterling from the Jerseys, one Battalion of about 720 Minute Men from  Jersey and one of the same No. from  Philadelphia. We shall soon have four Battalions more raised in Pensilvania, to march to the same Place and one more in the Jerseys Mr. Dickinson, being the first , and Commander of the first Battalion too, claimed it, as his Right to march upon this Occasion. Mr. Reed, formerly Gen. Washingtons Secretary goes his Lt. Coll. Mr. Dickinsons Alacrity and Spirit upon this occasion, which certainly becomes his Character and setts a fine Example, is much talk'd of and applauded. This afternoon, the four Battallions of the Militia were together, and Mr. Dickinson mounted the Rostrum to harrangue them, which he did with great Vehemence and Pathos, as it is reported. I suppose, if I could have made Interest enough to have been chosen more than a Lt., I should march too upon some such Emergency, and possibly a Contingency may happen, when it will be proper for me to do it still, in Rank and File. I will not fail to march if it should. In the Beginning of a War, in Colonies like this and  Virginia, where the martial Spirit is but just awakened and the People are unaccustomed to Arms, it may be proper and necessary for such popular Orators as Henry and Dickenson to assume a military Character. But I really think them both, better Statesmen than Soldiers,  I cannot say they are not very good in the latter Character.Henrys Principles, and Systems, are much more conformable to mine than the others however. I feel, upon some of these Occasions, a flow of Spirits, and an Effort of Imagination, very like an Ambition to be engaged in  more active, gay, and dangerous Scenes. (Dangerous I say but recall that Word, for there is no Course more dangerous than that which I am in.) I have felt such Passions all my Lifetime, particularly in the year 1757, when I longed more ardently to be a Soldier than I ever did to be a Lawyer. But I am too old, and too much worn, with Fatigues of Study in my youth, and there is too little need in my Province of such assistance, for me to assume an Uniform. Non tali Auxilio nec Defensoribus istis Tempus eget. I believe I must write you soon,  Character, because I was vastly pleased with him. For the future I shall draw no Characters but such as I like. Pimps destroy all Freedom of Correspondence.  "
"February 18, 1776","My dearest Friend  I sent you from  New York a Pamphlet  Common Sense, written in Vindication of Doctrines which there is Reason to expect that the further Encroachments of Tyranny and Depredations of Oppression, will soon make the common Faith: unless the cunning Ministry, by proposing Negociations and Terms of Reconciliation, should divert the present Current from its Channell. Reconciliation if practicable and Peace if attainable, you very well know would be as  to my Inclinations and as advantageous to my Interest, as to any Man's. But I see no Prospect, no Probability, no Possibility. And I cannot but despise the Understanding, which sincerely expects an honourable Peace, for its Credulity, and detest the hypocritical Heart, which pretends to expect it, when in Truth it does not. The News Papers here are full of free Speculations, the Tendency of which you will easily discover. The Writers reason from Topicks which have been long in Contemplation, and fully understood by the People at large in  New England, but have been attended to in the southern Colonies only by Gentlemen of free Spirits and liberal Minds, who are very few. I shall endeavour to inclose to you as many of the Papers and Pamphlets as I can, as long as I stay here. Some will go by this Conveyance. Dr. Franklin, Mr. Chase, and Mr. Charles Carroll of Carrollton in  Maryland, are chosen a Committee to go into  Canada. The Characters of the two first you know. The last is not a Member of Congress, but a Gentleman of  Fortune, perhaps the largest in  America, 150 or 200, thousand Pounds sterling, educated in some University in  France, tho a Native of  America, of great Abilities and Learning, compleat Master of French Language and a Professor of the Roman catholic Religion, yet a warm, a firm, a zealous Supporter of the Rights of  America, in whose Cause he has hazarded his all. Mr. John Carroll of  Maryland, a Roman Catholic Priest and a Jesuit, is to go with the Committee. The Priests in  Canada having refused Baptism and Absolution to our Friends there. General Lee is to command in that Country, whose Address, Experience, and Abilities added to his Fluency in the French Language, will give him great Advantages. The Events of War are uncertain: We cannot insure  Success, but We can deserve it. I am happy in this Provision for that important Department, because I think it the best that could be made in our Circumstances. Your Prudence will direct you to communicate the Circumstances of the Priest, the Jesuit and the Romish Religion only to such Persons as can judge of the Measure upon large and generous Principles, and will not indiscreetly divulge it. The Step was necessary, for the Anathema's of the Church are very terrible to our Friends in  Canada. I wish I understood French as well as you. I would have gone to  Canada, if I had. I feel the Want of Education every Day -- particularly of that Language. I pray My dear, that you would not suffer your Sons or your Daughter, ever to feel a similar Pain. It is in your Power to teach them French, and I every day see more and more that it will become a necessary Accomplishment of  American Gentleman and Lady. Pray write me in your next the Name of the Author of your thin French Grammar, which gives you the Pronunciation of the French Words in English Letters, i.e. which shews you, how the same Sounds would be signified by English Vowells and Consonants. Write me as often as you can -- tell me all the News. Desire the Children to write to me, and believe me to be theirs and yours. "

","My Dear Yesterday by  I had the Pleasure of a Letter from Mr.Palmer, in which he kindly informed me of your and the Familys Welfare. This is the first Intelligence I have had from  Braintree since I left it -- not a Line from you. Am sorry to learn that  Braintree People are alarmed -- hope they will not be attacked. Want to know the Particulars -- how they have been threatned &c. Thomas is made a Major General and ordered to  Canada. The general Expectation here is that the boldest Efforts of our Enemies will be made at  Virginia and  S. Carolina. -- I believe no such Thing.  Boston,  N. York and  Quebec will be their Object. I have sent you, as many Letters as I could, and some Pamphlets and News Papers, and shall continue to do so. I want a servant excessively. Know not what to do for Want of one. So much Company -- and so many Things to do. Write me as often as you can -- let me know whether Bass got home without any Accident, and whether your Fathers  Mare is well of her Wound. God bless you my dear, and all about you, to whom be pleased to remember my most tender Affection.  "
"March 17, 1776","Our worthy Friend  arrived here last Evening from  N.York, to which Place he came lately from  England in the Packet. In Company with him, is a Gentleman by the Name of Wrixon, who has been a Field Officer in the British Army, served all the last War in  Germany, and has seen service in every Part of Europe. He left the Army some time ago, and studied Law in the Temple, in which Science he made a great Proficiency. He wrote lately a Pamphlet under the Title of the Rights of Britons, which he has brought over with him. He is a Friend of Liberty and thinks justly of the American Question. He has great Abilities as well as Experience in the military Science, and is an able Engineer. I hope We shall employ him. The , We have made a Brigadier General, and ordered him to Canada. The Testimonials in his favour I shall inclose to you.  Account, with which Mr. Wrixons agrees, ought to extinguish in every Mind all Hopes of Reconciliation with  G. Britain. This delusive Hope has done us great Injuries, and if ever We are ruined, will be the Cause of our Fall. A Hankuring after the Leeks of  Egypt, makes us forget the Cruelty of her Task Masters. I shall suffer many severe Pains, on your Account for some Days. By a  from  Salem a Cannonade was heard from Dark till one O Clock, last night was a Week ago. Your Vicinity to such scenes of Carnage and Desolation, as I fear are now to be seen in  Boston  and its Environs, will throw you into much Distress, but I believe in my Conscience I feel more here than you do. The sound of Cannon, was not so terrible when I was at  Braintree as it is here, tho I hear it at four hundred Miles Distance. You cant imagine what a Mortification I sustain in not having received a single Line, from you since We parted. I suspect some , in Conveyance. By the Relation of , Mr. Wrixon and Mr. Temple, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Sewall, and their Associates are in great Disgrace in  England. Persons are ashamed to be seen to speak to them. They look dejected and sunk. I shall  an Extract of a Letter from Monsr. Dubourg in  Paris and a Testimonial in favour of our Prussian General. "
"March 19, 1776","Yesterday I had the long expected and much  Pleasure of a Letter from you, of various Dates from the  2d. to the 10 March . This is the first Line I have received since I left you. I wrote you from  Watertown I believe, relating my Feast at the Quarter Master General with the Coghnawaga Indians, and from Framingham, an Account of the ordnance there, and from  New York I sent you a Pamphlet -- hope you received these. Since my arrival here, I have written to you as often as I could.  I  much pleased with your Caution, in your Letter, in avoiding Names both of Persons and Places, or any other Circumstances, which might designate to Strangers, the Writer, or the Person written to, or the Persons mentioned. Characters and Descriptions will do as well. The , which you say occasioned such Disputes at the Tavern, was curious enough. -- Who could make and spread it? Am much obliged to an Unkle, for his Friendship: my worthy fellow Citizens may be easy about me. I never can forsake what I take to be their Interests. My own have never been considered by me, in Competition with theirs. My Ease, my domestic Happiness, my rural Pleasures, my Little Property, my personal Liberty, my Reputation, my Life, have little Weight and ever had, in my own Estimation, in Comparison of the great Object of my Country. I can say of it with great Sincerity, as Horace says of Virtue -- to America only and her Friends a Friend. You ask, what is thought of Common sense. Sensible Men think there are some Whims, some Sophisms, some  Addresses to superstitious Notions, some keen attempts upon the Passions, in this Pamphlet. But all agree there is a great deal of good sense, delivered in a clear, simple, concise and nervous Style. His Sentiments of the Abilities of  America, and of the Difficulty of a Reconciliation with  G.B. are generally approved. But his Notions, and Plans of Continental Government are not much applauded. Indeed this Writer has a better Hand at pulling down than building. It has been very generally propagated through the Continent that I wrote this Pamphlet. But  I could not have written any Thing in so manly and striking a style, I flatter myself I should have made a more respectable Figure as an Architect, if I had undertaken such a Work. This Writer seems to have very inadequate Ideas of what is proper and necessary to be done, in order to form Constitutions for single Colonies, as well as a great Model of Union for the whole. Your Distresses which you have painted in such lively , I feel in every Line as I read. I dare not write all that I think upon this Occasion. I wish our People had taken Possession of  Nook Hill, at the same Time when they got the other Heights, and before the Militia were dismissed. Poor Cousin! -- I  him. How much soever he may lament certain Letters I dont lament. I never repent of what was no sin. Misfortunes may be born without Whining. But if I can believe Mr. Dana, those Letters were much admired in  England. I cant help laughing when I write it, because they were really such hasty crude Scraps. If I could have foreseen their Fate, they should have been fit to be seen and worth all the Noise they have made.Mr. Dana says they were considered in  England as containing a comprehensive Idea of what was necessary to be done, and as shewing Resolution enough to do it. Wretched Stuff as they really were, (according to him) they have contributed somewhat towards making certain Persons' to be thought the greatest Statesmen in the World. -- So much for Vanity. Virginia will be well defended, so will  N.Y., so will  S. Car.  America will eer long, raise her Voice aloud, and assume a bolder Air. "
"March 29, 1776","I give you joy of  Boston and  Charlestown, once more the Habitations of Americans. Am waiting with great Impatience for Letters from you, which I know will contain many Particulars. We are taking Precautions to defend every Place that is in  --  The Carolinas,  Virginia,  N. York,Canada. I can think of nothing but fortifying  Boston . I want more Cannon than are to be had, I want a Fortification upon  Point Alderton, one upon Lovells Island, one upon  Georges Island, several upon  Long Island, one upon the  Moon, one upon  Squantum. I want to hear of half a Dozen Fire ships and two or three hundred Fire Rafts prepared. I want to hear of Row Gallies, floating Batteries Built, and Booms laid across the  in the Narrows and Vesseauu de Frize, sunk in it. I wish to hear, that you are translating  Braintree Commons into the Channell. No Efforts, No  are too extravagant for me to wish for to  [fortify] that Harbour so as to make it impregnable. I hope every Body will join and work untill it is done. We have this Week lost a very valuable Friend of the Colonies, in  of  Rhode Island, by the small Pox in the natural Way. He never would hearken to his Friends who have been constantly advising him to be inoculated ever since the first Congress began. But he would not be perswaded. Numbers, who have been inoculated, have gone through the Distemper, without any  Danger, or even Confinement, but nothing would do. -- He must take it in the natural Way and die. He was an amiable and a sensible Man, a stedfast Friend to his Country upon very pure Principles. His Funeral was attended with the same Solemnities as Mr. Randolphs. Mr. Stillman being the Anabaptist Minister here, of which  was the Governor, was desired by Congress to preach a sermon, which he did with great Applause. "
NA,"As to coming home, I have no Thoughts of it -- shall stay here till the Year is out, for what I know. Affairs are in a critical state and important Steps are now taking every day, so that I could not reconcile it to my own Mind to be absent from this Place at present. Nothing is expected from the Commissioners, yet We are waiting for them, in some Respects. The Tories, and Timids pretend to expect great Things from them. But the Generality expect nothing but more Insults and Affronts. Privateering is licensed and the Ports are wide open. As soon as the Resolves are printed, which will be tomorrow,  send them. I have had a long Conversation with . He seems to be in a better Temper, and I live on Terms of Decency and Civility with him and he with me. And I am determined to live so. Have lived in more Decency with him and another, since my last Return than ever, at least than since last August when the sin of Precedence was committed. Theres the Rub. But what cant be cured must be endured. "
April 12. 1776," a few Sheets of Paper, and will send more as fast as Opportunities present. Chesterfields Letters are a  sett. You would not choose to have them in your Library, they are like Congreeves Plays, stained with libertine Morals and base Principles. You will see by the Papers, the News, the Speculations and the Political Plans of the Day. The Ports are opened wide enough at last, and Privateers are allowed to prey upon British Trade. This is not Independency you know. -- What is? Why Government in every Colony, a Confederation among them all, and Treaties with foreign Nations, to acknowledge Us a Sovereign State, and all that. -- When these Things will be done, or any of them, Time must discover. Perhaps the Time is near, perhaps a great Way off. "
"Ap. 14, 1776","You justly complain of my short Letters, but the critical State of Things and the Multiplicity of Avocations must plead my Excuse.You ask where the Fleet is. The  Papers will inform you. You ask what Sort of Defence  Virginia can make. I believe they will make an able Defence. Their Militia and minute Men have been some time employed in training them selves, and they have Nine Battallions of regulars as they call them, maintained among them, under good Officers, at the Continental Expence. They have set up a Number of Manufactories of Fire Arms, which are busily employed. They are tolerably supplied with Powder, and are successfull and assiduous, in making Salt Petre. Their neighbouring Sister or rather Daughter Colony of  North Carolina, which is a warlike Colony, and has several Battallions at the Continental Expence, as well as a pretty good Militia, are ready to assist them, and they are in very good Spirits, and seem determined to make a brave Resistance. -- The Gentry are very rich, and the common People very poor. This Inequality of Property, gives an Aristocratical Turn to all their Proceedings, and occasions a strong Aversion in their Patricians, to Common Sense. But the Spirit of these Barons, is coming down, and it must submit. It is very true, as you observe they have been duped by Dunmore. But this is a Common Case. All the Colonies are duped, more or less, at one Time and another. A more egregious Bubble was never blown up, than the Story of Commissioners coming to treat with the Congress. Yet it has gained Credit like a Charm, not only without but against the clearest Evidence. I never shall forget the Delusion, which seized our best and most sagacious Friends the dear Inhabitants of  Boston, the Winter before last. Credulity and the Want of Foresight, are Imperfections in the human Character, that no Politician can sufficiently guard against. You have given me some Pleasure, by your Account of a certain House in Queen Street. I had burned it, long ago, in Imagination. It rises now to my View like a Phoenix. -- What shall I say of the Solicitor General? I pity his pretty Children, I pity his  Father, and his sisters. I wish I could be clear that it is no moral Evil to pity him and his Lady. Upon Repentance they will certainly have a large Share in the Compassions of many. But  [illegible]   let Us take Warning and give it to our Children. Whenever Vanity, and Gaiety, a Love of Pomp and Dress, Furniture, Equipage, Buildings, great Company, expensive Diversions, and elegant Entertainments get the better of the Principles and Judgments of Men or Women there is no knowing where they will stop, nor into what Evils, natural, moral, or political, they will lead us. Your Description of your own Gaiety de Coeur, charms me. Thanks be to God you have just Cause to rejoice -- and may the bright Prospect be obscured by no Cloud. As to Declarations of Independency, be patient. Read our Privateering Laws, and our Commercial Laws. What signifies a Word. As to your extraordinary Code of Laws, I cannot but laugh. We have been told that our Struggle has loosened the bands of Government . That Children and Apprentices were disobedient -- that schools and Colledges were grown turbulent -- that Indians slighted their Guardians and Negroes grew insolent to their Masters. But your Letter was the first Intimation that another Tribe more numerous and powerfull than all the rest were grown discontented. -- This is rather too coarse a Compliment but you are so saucy, I wont blot it out. Depend upon it, We know better than to repeal our Masculine systems.  they are in full Force, you know they are little more than Theory. We dare not exert our Power in its full Latitude. We are obliged to go fair, and softly, and in Practice you know We are the subjects. We have only the Name of Masters, and rather than give up this, which would compleatly subject Us to the Despotism of the Peticoat, I hope General Washington, and all our brave Heroes would fight. I am sure every good Politician would plot, as long as he would against Despotism, Empire, Monarchy, Aristocracy, Oligarchy, or Ochlocracy. -- A fine Story indeed. I begin to think the Ministry as deep as they are wicked. After stirring up Tories, Landjobbers, Trimmers, Bigots, Canadians, Indians, Negroes, Hanoverians, Hessians, Russians, Irish Roman Catholicks, Scotch Renegadoes, at last they have stimulated the to demand new Priviledges and threaten to rebell. "
"April 15, 1776","I send you every News Paper, that comes out, and I send you now and then a few sheets of Paper but this Article is as scarce here, as with you. I would send a Quire, if I could get a Conveyance. I write you, now and then a Line, as often as I can, but I can tell you no News, but what I send in the public Papers. We are Waiting it is said for Commissioners, a Messiah that will never come. -- This Story of Commissioners is as arrant an Illusion as ever was hatched in the Brain of an Enthusiast, a Politician, or a Maniac. I have  at it -- scolded at it -- griev'd at it -- and I dont know but I may at an unguarded Moment have rip'd at it -- but it is vain to Reason against such Delusions. I was very sorry to see in a Letter from the General that he had been bubbled with it, and still more to see in a Letter from my sagacious Friend  [Warren] at  Plymouth, that he was taken in too. My Opinion is that the Commissioners and the Commission have been here  these two Months. The Governors, Mandamus Councillors, Collectors and Comptrollers, and Commanders of the Army and Navy, I conjecture compose the List and their Power is to receive Submissions.  But We are not in a very submissive Mood. They will get no Advantage of Us. We shall go on, to Perfection I believe. I have been very busy for some time -- have written about Ten sheets of Paper with my own Hand, about some trifling Affairs, which I may mention some time or othernot now for fear of Accidents. What will come of this  Time will discover. I shall get nothing by it, I believe, because I never get any Thing by any Thing that I do. I am sure the Public or Posterity ought to get Something. I believe my Children will think I might as well have thought and laboured, a little, night and Day for their Benefit.... But I will not bear the Reproaches of my Children. I will tell them that I studied and  to procure a free Constitution of Government for them to solace themselves under, and if they do not prefer this to ample Fortune, to Ease and Elegance, they are not my Children, and I care not what becomes of them. They shall live upon thin Diet, wear mean Cloaths, and work hard, with Chearfull Hearts and free Spirits or they may be the Children of the Earth or of no one, for me.  has Genius and so has Charles. Take Care that they dont go astray. Cultivate their Minds, inspire their little Hearts, raise their Wishes. Fix their Attention upon great and glorious Objects, root out every little Thing, weed out every Meanness, make them great and manly. Teach them to scorn Injustice, Ingratitude, Cowardice, and Falshood. Let them revere nothing but Religion, Morality and Liberty.  and Tommy are not forgotten by me altho I did not mention them before. The first by Reason of her sex, requires a Different Education from the two I have mentioned. Of this you are the only judge. I want to send each of my little pretty flock, some present or other. I have walked over this City twenty Times and gaped at every shop like a Countryman to find something, but could not. Ask every one of them what they would choose to have and write it to me in your next Letter. From this I shall judge of their Taste and Fancy and Discretion. "
"April 23d, 1776","This is St. Georges Day, a Festival celebrated by the English, as Saint Patricks is by the Irish, St. Davids by the Welch, and St. Andrews by the Scotch. The Natives of old  England in this City heretofore formed a Society, which they called Saint Georges , or Saint Georges Society. Upon the Twenty third of April annually, they had a great Feast. But The Times and Politicks have made a schism in the society so that one Part of them are to meet and dine at the City Tavern, and the other att the Bunch of Grapes, Israel Jacobs's, and a third Party go out of Town. One  are staunch Americans, another staunch Britons I suppose, and a Third half Way Men, Neutral Beings, moderate Men, prudent Folks -- for such is the Division among Men upon all Occasions and every Question. This is the Account, which I have from my Barber, who is one of the Society and zealous on the side of  America, and one of the Philadelphia Associators. This curious Character of a Barber, I have a great Inclination to draw for your Amusement. He is a little dapper fellow, short and small, but active and lively, a Tongue as fluent and voluble as you please, Wit at Will, and  an Invention which never leaves him at a Loss for a story to tell you for your Entertainment. He has seen great Company. He has dressed Hair, and shaved Faces at Bath and at Court. He is acquainted with several of the Nobility and Gentry, particularly Sir William Meredith. He married a Girl the Daughter of a Quaker in this Place, of whom he tells many droll stories. He is a serjeant in one of the Companies of some Battalion or other here. He frequents, of Evenings, a Beer House kept by one Weaver, in the City, where he has many curious Disputes and Adventures, and meets many odd Characters. I believe you will think me very idle, to write you so trifling a Letter upon so uninteresting a subject, at a Time, when my Country is fighting Pro Aris et Focis. But I assure you I am glad to  with this Barber while he is shaving and combing me, to divert myself from less agreable Thoughts. He is so sprightly, and good humoured, that he contributes more than I could have imagined to my Comfort in this Life.  has prepared a String of Toasts for the Clubb to drink to day at Israels. "
April 28. 1776,"Yesterday, I received two Letters from you from the  7th.  to the  14. of April . I believe I have received all your Letters, and I am not certain I wrote one from  Framingham. The one I mean contains an Account of my dining with the Indians at Mr. Mifflins. It gives me Concern to think of the many Cares you must have upon your Mind. Am glad you have taken  into Pay, and that Isaac is well before now I hope. Your Reputation, as a Farmer, or any Thing else you undertake I dare answer for ....Your Partners Character as a Statesman is much more problematical. As to my Return, I have not a Thought of it. Journeys of such a Length are tedious, and expensive both of Time and Money neither of which are my own. I hope to spend the next Christmas, where I did the last, and after that I hope to be relieved for by that Time I shall have taken a pretty good Trick  Helm whether the Vessell has been well steer'd or not. But if My Countrymen should insist upon my serving them another Year, they must let me bring my whole Family with me. Indeed I could keep House here, with my Partner, four children and two servants, as cheap as I maintain my self here with two Horses and a servant at Lodgings. Instead of domestic Felicity, I am destined to public Contentions. Instead of rural Felicity, I must reconcile myself to the Smoke and Noise of a city. In the Place of private Peace, I must be distracted with the   Vexation of developing the deep Intrigues of Politicians and must assist in conducting the arduous Operations of War. And think myself, well rewarded, if my private Pleasure and Interest are sacrificed as they ever have been and will be, to the Happiness of others. You tell me, our jurors refuse to serve, because the Writs are issued in the Kings Name. I am very glad to hear, that they discover so much Sense and Spirit. I learn from another Letter that the General Court have left out of their Bills the Year of his Reign, and that they are making a Law, that the same Name shall be left out of all Writs, Commissions, and all Law Proscesses. This is good News too. The same will be the Case in all the Colonies, very soon. You ask me how I have done the Winter past. I have not enjoyed so good Health as last Fall. But I have done complaining of any Thing. Of ill Health I have no Right to complain because it is given me by Heaven. Of Meanness, of Envy, of Littleness, of -- of -- of -- of -- I have Reason and Right to complain, but I have too much Contempt, to use that Right. There is such a Mixture of Folly, Littleness, and Knavery in this World that, I am weary of it, and  I behold it with unutterable Contempt and Indignation, yet the public Good requires that I should take no Notice of it, by Word or by Letter. And to this public Good I will conform. You will see an Account of the Fleet in some of the Papers I have sent you. Give you joy of the Admirals Success. I have Vanity enough to take to myself, a share in the Merit of the American Navy. It was always a Measure that my Heart was much engaged in, and I pursued it, for a long Time, against the Wind and Tide. But at last obtained it. Is there no Way for two friendly Souls, to converse together,  the Bodies are 400 Miles off? -- Yes by Letter. -- But I want a better Communication. I want to hear you think, or to see your Thoughts. The Conclusion of your Letter makes my Heart throb, more than a Cannonade would. You bid me burn your Letters. But I must forget you first. In yours of  April 14  you say you miss our Friend in the Conveyance of your Letters. Dont hesitate to write by the Post. Seal well. Dont miss a single Post. You take it for granted that I have particular Intelligence of every Thing from others. But I have not. If any one wants a Vote for a Commission, he vouchsafes me a Letter, but tells me very little News. I have more particulars from you than any one else. Pray keep me constantly informed, what ships are in the  and what Fortifications are going on. I am quite impatient to hear of more vigorous Measures for fortifying  Boston . Not a Moment should be neglected. Every Man ought to go down as they did after the Battle of  Lexington and work untill it is done. I would willingly pay half a Dozen Hands my self, and subsist them, rather than it should not be done  [immediately]. It is of more importance than to raise Corn. You say  is a Prologue and a Parody, but neither was inclosed. If you did not forget it, the letter has been opened and the Inclosures taken out. If the Small Pox spreads, run me in debt. I received a Post or two past a Letter from your  at  Salem, containing a most friendly and obliging Invitation to you and yours to go, and have the Distemper at his House if it should spread. He has one or two in family to have it. The Writer of Common Sense, and the Forrester, is the same Person. His Name is , a Gentleman, about two Years ago from  England, a Man who  [General] Lee says has Genius in his Eyes. The Writer of Cassandra is said to be Mr. James Cannon a Tutor, in the  Philadelphia Colledge. Cato is reported here to be Dr. Smith -- a Match for Brattle.  The oration was an insolent Performance .... A Motion was made to Thank the orator and ask a Copy -- But opposed with great Spirit, and Vivacity from every Part of the Room, and at last withdrawn, lest it should be rejected as it certainly would have been with Indignation. The orator then printed it himself, after leaving out or altering some offensive Passages. This is one of the many irregular, and extravagant Characters of the Age. I never heard one single person speak well of any Thing about him but his Abilities, which are generally allowed to be good. The Appointment of him to make the oration, was a great oversight, and Mistake. The late Act of Parliament, has made so deep an Impression upon Peoples Minds throughout the Colonies, it is looked upon as the last Stretch of Oppression, that We are hastening rapidly to great Events. Governments will be up  before Midsummer, and an End to Royal style, Titles and Authority. Such mighty Revolutions make a deep Impression on the Minds of Men and sett  [many violent] Passions at Work. Hope, Fear, Joy, Sorrow, Love, Hatred, Malice, Envy, Revenge, Jealousy, Ambition, Avarice, Resentment, Gratitude, and every other Passion, Feeling, Sentiment, Principle and Imagination, were never in more lively Exercise than they are now, from  Florida to  Canada inclusively. May God in his Providence overrule the whole, for the good of Mankind. It requires more Serenity of Temper, a deeper Understanding and more Courage than fell to the Lott of Marlborough, to ride in this Whirlwind. "
"May 12, 1776","Yours of April 21  came to Hand yesterday. I send you regularly every Newspaper, and write as often as I can -- but I feel more skittish about writing than I did, because since the Removal of Head Quarters to  New York, We have no Expresses, and very few Individual Travellers, and the Post I am not quite confident in. However I shall write as I can. What shall I do with my Office -- I want to resign it for a Thousand Reasons. Would you advise me? There has been a gallant Battle, in  Delaware River between the Gallies and two Men of War, the Roebuck and Liverpool, in which the Men of War came off second best -- which has diminished, in the Minds of the People, on both sides the River, the Terror of a Man of War. I long to hear a little of my private Affairs, yet I dread it too, because I know you must be perplexed and . I wish it was in my Power to relieve you. It gives me great Pleasure to learn that our Rulers are at last doing something, towards the Fortification of  Boston. But I am inexpressibly  to find that the Enemy is fortifying on  Georges Island. I never shall be easy untill they are compleatly driven out of that Harbour and effectually prevented from ever getting in again. As you are a Politician, and now elected into an important Office, that of judgess of the Tory Ladies, which will give you naturally an Influence with your sex, I hope you will be instant, in season and out of season, in exhorting them to use their Influence with the Gentlemen, to fortify upon  Georges Island,  Lovells,  Petticks  [Peddocks],  Long, or wherever else it it is proper. Send down Fire ships and Rafts and burn to Ashes those Pirates. I am out of all Patience with the languid, lethargic Councils of the Province, at such a critical, important Moment, puzzling their Heads about Two penny fees and Confession Bills and what not, when the  of  Boston was defenceless. If I was there I should storm and thunder, like Demonsthenes, or scold like a Tooth drawer. Do ask Mr. Wybirt and Mr. Welld, and Mr. Taft to preach about it. I am ashamed, , angry to the last degree! Our People by their Torpitude have invited the Enemy to come to  Boston again -- and I fear they will have the Civility and Politeness to accept the Invitation. Your Uncle has never answered my Letter. Thank the Doctor. He has written me a most charming Letter, full of Intelligence, and very sensible and  Remarks. I will pay the Debt as far as my Circumstances will admit, and as soon. But I hope my friends will not wait for regular Returns from me. I have not yet left off ""pitying the fifty or sixty Men"" and if My Friends knew all that I do, they would pity too. Betcy Smith, Lazy Huzzy, has not written me a Line, a great While. I wish she was married -- then she would have some Excuse. Duty to Pa. Love to all. How is the Family over against the Church? "
"May 15, 1776","Mr. Church  off, tomorrow Morning. I have sent this Morning by Mr. William Winthrop, about half a dozen Letters containing Papers &c. Have nothing new to write. We have been very busily engaged for 4 or 5 days in procuring Assistance for  Boston. Congress has at last voted three Additional  for  Boston and that the five old ones be filled up, and We shall send you a Major General and a Brigadier General -- Gates and Mifflin I hope but cant promise. With much Pleasure I learn that, the People of Town and Country as well as the troops are at length aroused and active to fortify  Boston . I hope they will learn to make and use Fire ships and Fire Rafts. "
"May 17, 1776","I have this Morning heard Mr. Duffil upon the Signs of the Times. He run a  between the Case of  Israel and that of  America, and between the Conduct of Pharaoh and that of George. Jealousy that the Israelites would throw off the Government of  Egypt made him issue his Edict that the Midwives should cast the Children into the River, and the other Edict that the Men should make a large Revenue of Brick without Straw. He concluded that the Course of Events, indicated strongly the Design of Providence that We should be  from  G. Britain, &c. Is it not a Saying of Moses, who am I, that I should go in and out before this great People? When I consider the great Events which are passed, and those greater which are rapidly advancing, and that I may have been instrumental of touching some Springs, and turning some small Wheels, which have had and will have such Effects, I feel an Awe upon my Mind, which is not easily described.  has at last driven  America, to the last Step, a compleat Seperation from her, a total absolute Independence, not only of her Parliament but of her Crown, for such is the Amount of the Resolve of the 15th. Confederation among ourselves, or Alliances with foreign Nations are not necessary, to a perfect  from  Britain. That is effected by extinguishing all Authority, under the Crown, Parliament and Nation as the Resolution for instituting Governments, has done, to all Intents and Purposes. Confederation will be necessary for our internal Concord, and Alliances may be so for our external Defence. I have Reasons to believe that no Colony, which shall assume a Government under the People, will give it up. There is something very unnatural and odious in a Government 1000 Leagues off. An whole Government of our own Choice, managed by Persons whom We love, revere, and can confide in, has charms in it for which Men will fight. Two young Gentlemen from  South Carolina, now in this City, who were in  Charlestown when their new Constitution was promulgated, and when their new Governor and Council and Assembly walked out in Procession, attended by the Guards, Company of , Light Horse &c., told me, that they were beheld by the People with Transports and Tears of Joy. The People gazed at them, with a Kind of Rapture. They both told me, that the Reflection that these were Gentlemen whom they all loved, esteemed and revered, Gentlemen of their own Choice, whom they could trust, and whom they could displace if any of them should behave amiss, affected them so that they could not help crying. They say their People will never give up this Government. One of these Gentlemen is a Relation of yours, a Mr. Smith, son of Mr. Thomas Smith. I shall give him this Letter or another to you. A Privateer fitted out here by  Reberdeau  [Roberdeau] and Major Bayard, since our Resolves for Privateering, I am this Moment informed, has taken a valuable Prize. This is Encouragement, at the Beginning. In one or two of your Letters you remind me to think of you as I ought. Be assured there is not an Hour in the Day, in which I do not think of you as I ought, that is with every Sentiment of Tenderness, Esteem, and Admiration. "
May 22d. 1776,"When a Man is seated, in the Midst of forty People some of whom are talking, and others whispering, it is not easy to think, what is proper to write. I shall send you the , which will inform you, of public Affairs, and the particular Flickerings of Parties in this Colony. I am happy to learn from your Letter, that a Flame is at last raised among the People, for the Fortification of the . Whether  Nantaskett, or  Point Alderton would be proper Posts to be taken I cant say. But I would fortify every Place, which is proper, and which Cannon could be obtained for. Generals Gates and Mifflin are now here.  Washington will be here tomorrow -- when We shall consult and deliberate, concerning the Operations of the ensuing Campain. We have dismal Accounts from  Europe, of the Preparations against Us. This Summer will be very important to Us. We shall have a severe  of our Patience, Fortitude and Perseverance. But I hope we shall do valiantly and tread down our Enemies. I have some Thoughts of petitioning the General Court for Leave to bring my Family, here. I am a lonely, forlorn, Creature here. It used to be some Comfort to me, that I had a servant, and some Horses -- they composed a Sort of Family for me. But now, there is not one Creature here, that I seem to have any Kind of Relation to. It is a cruel Reflection, which very often comes across me, that I should be  so far, from those Babes, whose Education And Welfare lies so near my Heart: But greater Misfortunes than these, must not divert Us from Superiour Duties. Your Sentiments of the Duties We owe to our Country, are such as become the best of Women, and the best of Men. Among all the Disappointments, and Perplexities, which have fallen to my share in Life, nothing has contributed so much to support my Mind, as the choice Blessing of a Wife, whose Capacity enabled her to comprehend, and whose pure Virtue obliged her to approve the Views of her Husband. This has been the cheering Consolation of my Heart, in my most solitary, gloomy and disconsolate Hours. In this remote Situation, I am deprived in a great Measure of this Comfort. Yet I read, and read again your charming Letters, and they serve me, in some faint degree as a substitute for the Company and Conversation of the Writer. I want to take a Walk with you in the Garden -- to go over to the Common -- the Plain -- the Meadow. I want to take  in one Hand and Tom in the other, and Walk with you, Nabby on your Right Hand and John upon my left, to view the Corn Fields, the orchards, &c.  poor Imagination! how faintly and imperfectly do you supply the Want of original and Reality! But instead of these pleasing  of domestic Life, I hope you will not be disturbed with the Alarms of War. I hope yet I fear. "
May 27. 1776,"I have three of your , before me -- one of  May 7 ., another of  May 9 . and a third of  May 14th . The last has given me Relief from many Anxieties. It relates wholly to private Affairs, and contains such an Account of wise and prudent Management, as makes me very happy. I begin to be jealous, that our Neighbours will think Affairs more discreetly conducted in my Absence than at any other Time. Whether your Suspicions concerning a Letter under a marble Cover, are just or not, it is best to say little about it. It is an hasty hurried Thing and of no great Consequence, calculated for a Meridian at a great Distance from  . If it has done no good, it will do no harm. It has contributed to sett People a thinking upon the subject, and in this respect has answered its End. The Manufactory of Governments having, since the Publication of that Letter, been as much talk'd of, as that of salt Petre was before. I rejoice at your Account of the Spirit of Fortification, and the good Effects of it. I hope by this Time you are in a tolerable Posture of . The Inhabitants of  Boston have done themselves great Honour, by their laudable Zeal, the worthy Clergymen especially. I think you shine as a Stateswoman, of late as well as a Farmeress. Pray where do you get your Maxims of State, they are very apropos. I am much obliged to judge Cushing, and his Lady for their polite Visit to you: should be very happy to see him, and converse with him about many Things but cannot hope for that Pleasure, very soon. The Affairs of  America, are in so critical a State, such great Events are struggling for Birth, that I must not quit this station at this Time. Yet I dread the melting Heats of a  Philadelphia Summer, and know not how my frail Constitution will endure it. Such constant Care, such incessant Application of Mind, drinking up and exhausting the finer Spirits upon which Life and Health so essentially depend, will wear away a stronger Man than I am. -- Yet I will not shrink from this Danger or this Toil. While my Health shall be such that I can discharge in any tolerable  manner, the Duties of this important Post, I will not desert it. Am pleased to hear that the  Court is to sit, at  Ipswich in June. This will contribute to give Stability to the Government, I hope, in all its Branches. . . . But I presume other Steps will be taken for this Purpose. A Governor and Lt. Governor, I hope will be chosen, and the Constitution a little more fixed. I hope too that the Councill will this year be more full and augmented by the Addition of good Men. I hope Mr. Bowdoin will be Governor, if his Health will permit, and Dr. Winthrop Lt. Governor. These are wise, learned, and prudent Men. The first has a great Fortune, and wealthy Connections, the other has the Advantage of a Name and Family which is much reverenced, besides his Personal Abilities and Virtues, which are very great. Our Friend, I sincerely hope, will not refuse his Appointment, for although I have ever thought that Bench should be  from the Bar, and once laboured successfully to effect it, yet as the Gentlemen have  seen fit to decline, I know of no Gentleman, who would do more Honour to the Station than my Friend. None would be so agreable to me, whether I am to sit by him, or before him. I suppose it must be disagreable to him and his Lady, because he loves to be upon his Farm, and they both love to be together. But you must tell them of a Couple of their Friends who are as fond of living together, who are obliged to sacrifice their rural Amusements and domestic Happiness to the Requisitions of the public. The Generals Washington, Gates, and Mifflin are all here, and We shall derive Spirit, Unanimity, and  from their Presence and Advice. I hope you will have some General Officers at  Boston soon.  I am, with constant Wishes and Prayers for your Health, and Prosperity, forever yours. "
June 2. 1776,"Yesterday I dined with Captain Richards, the Gentleman who made me the present of the brass . We had Cherries, Strawberries and Green Peas in Plenty. The Fruits are three Weeks earlier here than with you, indeed they are a fortnight earlier on the East, than on the West side of Delaware River. We have had green Peas, this Week past, but they were brought over the River from New Jersey to this Markett. There are none grown in the City, or on the West side of the River yet. The Reason is, the Soil of  New Jersey is a warm Sand, that of  Pensilvania, a cold Clay. So much for Peas and Berries. Now for something of more Importance. In all the Correspondencies I have maintained, during a Course of twenty Years at least that I have been a Writer of Letters, I never kept a single Copy. This Negligence and Inaccuracy, has been a great Misfortune to me, on many Occasions. -- I have now purchased a Folio Book, in the first Page of which, excepting one blank , I am writing this Letter, and intend to write all my Letters to you in it from this Time forward. This will be an Advantage to me in several Respects. In the first Place, I shall write more deliberately. In the second Place, I shall be able at all times to review what I have written. 3. I shall know how often I write. 4. I shall discover by this Means, whether any of my Letters to you, miscarry. If it were possible for me to find a Conveyance, I would send you such another blank Book, as a Present, that you might begin the Practice at the same Time, for I really think that your Letters are much better worth preserving than mine. Your Daughter and Sons will very soon write so good Hands that they will copy the Letters for you from your Book, which will improve them at the same Time that it relieves you. "
"Philadelphia  June 3. 1776
","The last Evening, Mess. Adams,  and  [Gerry] and my self, by Agreement waited on the  [President] at his House, in order to accompany him to the Generals, to request that Gates and Mifflin might be sent immediately, to take the Command at Boston. The P. we found very ill of a violent fitt of the Gout, unable to go abroad. At our Disire, he sent a Card to the G. requesting his Company, who soon afterwards came. This Conversation would make a Figure in History. It turned upon the general State of Affairs in the military Departments, and the Characters of the principal Officers in the Army. -- I dont think it prudent to commit to Writing the Particulars. But a few Reflections that occurred, may be safely written. One is this. There is so much of Accident in the Appointment of Officers, even where they are chosen by the People or their Representatives, and their Characters are of such vast Importance, after they are appointed, and in Times like these when there are so many jealousies, Envys, and Distrusts abroad from whence so many Calumnies arise, that it is absolutely necessary to support the Characters of Officers whenever you can, to be silent when you cannot,  you are furnished with sufficient Evidence of their Faults and Guilt, and then censure, and punish. "
June 16. 1776,"Yesterday was to me a lucky Day, as it brought me two Letters from you, one dated  May 27  and the other  June   Dont be concerned, about me, if it happens now and then that you dont hear from me, for some Weeks together. If  should injure my Health materially, you will soon hear of it. But I thank God I am in much better Health than I expected to be. But this cannot last long, under the Load that I carry. When it becomes too great for my Strength I shall ask leave to lay it down and come home. But I will hold it out a good while yet, if I can. I am willing to take the Woodland Sister mentions, and the Watch and the sword. As to the Lighter, it cost more than five hundred Dollars in hard Cash. I wish our Uncle  had as much Ambition, as he has Virtue and Ability. A Deficiency of Ambition is as criminal and injurious as an Excess of it. -- Tell him I say so. -- How shall We contrive to make so wise and good a Man ambitious? Is it not a sin to be so modest. Ask him how he can answer it? So! then it seems the Brigadier  [Joseph Palmer] was obliged to step down Stairs in order to keep my Brother, out of the lower Room . . . I am sorry for it. Thanks for your Quotation from Sully. It is  appropos. I am very glad you are so well provided with Help. Give my Respects to Mr. Belcher, and his Family. Tell him, I am obliged to him for his Kind Care of the Farm. I wish I could go out with him, and see the Business go on, but I cant. Thank your Father, and my Mother, for their kind Remembrance of me. Return my Duty to both.  young Heroism charms me. Kiss him. Poor Mugford. Yet glorious Mugford. -- How beautifull and sublime it is to die for ones Country .-- What a fragrant Memory remains! The  you heard of General Gates, will prove premature. I endeavoured both here and with the General, to have it so, and should have succeeded, if it had not been for the Loss of General Thomas. Cruel small Pox! worse than the sword! But now I fear We must part With Gates for the sake of  Canada. Mrs. Montgomery is a Lady like all the Family, of refined Sentiments and elegant Accomplishments. Her Letter, as you quote it, is very pathetic. Do you mean that our  Plymouth Friends are in Trouble for a disordered son! If so, I am grieved to the Heart. God grant them support under so severe an Affliction. But this World is a scene of Afflictions. Rejoice to hear that the Enemy has not fortified. Hope they will not be suffered to attempt it. Dont think about my . I do well enough in that Respect. As to your House at  Boston, do with it, as you please. Sell it, if you will, but not for a farthing less than it cost me. Let it, if you please, but take Care who your Tenant is -- both of his Prudence to preserve the House, and his Ability to pay the Rent. Your Brother, I hope will be promoted. He is fit for it, and has deserved it. If his Name comes recommended from the General Court, he will have a Commission for a Field Officer, and I will recommend him to the General for his Notice. My Pupil, if he pleases, will do  to his Preceptor, and important service to his Country. I hope his Zeal and Fidelity will be found equal to his Abilities. I will  to relieve your Head Ach if I can. I send you all the News, in the Papers. Great Things are on the Tapis. These Throws will usher in the Birth of a fine Boy. We have no Thoughts of removing from hence -- there is no occasion for it. "
June 26. 1776,"I have written so seldom to you, that I am really grieved at the Recollection. I wrote you, a few Lines,  June 2  and a few more June 26. These are all that I have written to you, since this Month began. It has been the  Month, that ever I saw. I have found Time to inclose all the News papers, which I hope you will receive in due Time. Our Misfortunes in  Canada, are enough to melt an Heart of Stone. The Small Pox is ten times more terrible than Britons, Canadians and Indians together. This was the Cause of our precipitate Retreat from  Quebec, this the Cause of our Disgraces at the Cedars. -- I dont mean that this was all. There has been Want, approaching to Famine, as well as Pestilence. And these Discouragements seem to have so disheartened our Officers, that none of them seem to Act with Prudence and Firmness. But these Reverses of Fortune dont discourage me. It was natural to expect them, and We ought to be prepared in our Minds for greater Changes, and more  Scenes still. It is an animating Cause, and brave Spirits are not subdued with Difficulties. Amidst all our gloomy Prospects in  Canada, We receive some Pleasure from  Boston. I congratulate you on your Victory over your Enemies, in the . This has long lain near my Heart, and it gives me great Pleasure to think that what was so much wished, is accomplished. I hope our People will now make the Lower , impregnable, and never again suffer the Flagg of a Tyrant to fly, within any Part of it. The Congress have been pleased to give me more Business than I am qualified for, and more than I fear, I can go through, with safety to my Health. They have established a Board of War and Ordinance and made me President of it, an  to which I never aspired, a Trust to which I feel my self vastly unequal. But I am determined to do as well as I can and make Industry supply, in some degree the Place of Abilities and Experience. The Board sits, every Morning and every Evening. This, with Constant Attendance in Congress, will so entirely engross my Time, that I fear, I shall not be able to write you, so often as I have. But I will steal Time to write to you. The small Pox! The small Pox! What shall We do with it? I could almost wish that an innoculating Hospital was opened, in every Town in  New England. It is some small Consolation, that the  Savages have taken a large Dose of it. They plundered the Baggage, and stripped off the Cloaths of our Men, who had the Small Pox, out full upon them at the Cedars. "
"Philadelphia  July 3. 1776
","Your  of  June 17  dated at  Plymouth, was handed me, by yesterdays Post. I was much pleased to find that you had taken a journey to  Plymouth, to see your Friends in the long Absence of one whom you may wish to see. The Excursion will be an Amusement, and will serve your Health. How happy would it have made me to have taken this journey with you? I was informed, a day or two before the Receipt of your Letter, that you was gone to  Plymouth, by Mrs. Polly Palmer, who was obliging enough in your Absence, to inform me, of the Particulars of the Expedition to the lower  against the Men of War. Her Narration is executed, with a Precision and Perspicuity, which would have become the Pen of an accomplished Historian. I am very glad you had so good an opportunity of seeing one of our little American Men of War. Many Ideas, new to you, must have presented themselves in such a Scene; and you will in future, better understand the Relations of Sea Engagements. I rejoice  at Dr. Bulfinches Petition to open an Hospital. But I hope, the Business will be done upon a larger Scale. I hope, that one Hospital will be licensed in every County, if not in every Town. I am happy to find you resolved, to be with the Children, in the first Class. Mr. Whitney and Mrs. Katy Quincy, are cleverly through Innoculation, in this City. I have one  to ask, and that is, that in your future Letters, you would acknowledge the Receipt of all those you may receive from me, and mention their Dates. By this Means I shall know if any of mine miscarry. The Information you give me of our Friends refusing his Appointment, has given me much Pain, Grief and Anxiety. I believe I shall be obliged to follow his Example. I have not Fortune enough to support my Family, and what is of more Importance, to support the Dignity of that exalted Station. It is too high and lifted up, for me; who delight in nothing so much as Retreat, Solitude, Silence, and Obscurity. In private Life, no one has a Right to censure me for following my own Inclinations, in Retirement, Simplicity, and Frugality: in public Life, every Man has a Right to remark as he pleases, at least he thinks so. Yesterday the greatest Question was decided, which ever was debated in  America, and a greater perhaps, never was or will be decided among Men. A Resolution was passed without one dissenting Colony  ""that these united Colonies, are, and of right ought to be free and independent States, and as such, they have, and of Right ought to have full Power to make War, conclude Peace, establish Commerce, and to do all the other Acts and Things, which other States may rightfully do."" You will see in a few days a Declaration setting forth the Causes, which have  Us to this mighty Revolution, and the Reasons which will justify it, in the Sight of God and Man. A Plan of Confederation will be taken up in a few days. When I look back to the Year 1761, and recollect the Argument concerning Writs of Assistance, in the  Court, which I have hitherto considered as the Commencement of the Controversy, between  Great Britain and  America, and run through the whole Period from that Time to this, and recollect the series of political Events, the Chain of Causes and Effects, I am surprized at the Suddenness, as well as Greatness of this Revolution.  Britain has been fill'd with Folly, and  America with Wisdom, at least this is my judgment. -- Time must determine. It is the Will of Heaven, that the two Countries should be sundered forever. It may be the Will of Heaven that  America shall suffer Calamities still more wasting and Distresses yet more dreadfull. If this is to be the Case, it will have this good Effect, at least: it will inspire Us with many Virtues, which We have not, and correct many Errors, Follies, and Vices, which threaten to disturb, dishonour, and destroy Us. -- The Furnace of Affliction produces Refinement, in States as well as Individuals. And the new Governments we are assuming, in every Part, will require a Purification from our Vices, and an Augmentation of our Virtues or they will be no Blessings. The People will have unbounded Power. And the People are extreamly addicted to Corruption and Venality, as well as the Great.   [The letterbook copy of this letter includes the following sentence:]  [ I am not without Apprehensions from this Quarter.]-- But I must submit all my Hopes and Fears, to an overruling Providence, in which, unfashionable  [ as] the Faith may be, I firmly believe. "
"Philadelphia  July 3d. 1776
","Had a Declaration of Independency been made seven Months ago, it would have been attended with many great and glorious Effects . . . . We might before this Hour, have formed Alliances with foreign States. -- We should have mastered  Quebec and been in Possession of  Canada .... You will perhaps wonder, how such a Declaration would have influenced our Affairs, in  Canada, but if I could write with Freedom I could easily convince you, that it would, and explain to you the manner how. -- Many Gentlemen in high Stations and of great Influence have been duped, by the ministerial Bubble of Commissioners to treat .... And in real, sincere Expectation of this  Event, which they so fondly wished, they have been slow and languid, in promoting Measures for the Reduction of that Province. Others there are in the Colonies who really wished that our Enterprise in  Canada would be defeated, that the Colonies might be brought into Danger and Distress between two Fires, and be thus induced to submit. Others really wished to defeat the Expedition to  Canada, lest the Conquest of it, should elevate the Minds of the People too much to hearken to those Terms of Reconciliation which they believed would be offered Us. These jarring Views, Wishes and Designs, occasioned an opposition to many salutary Measures, which were proposed for the Support of that Expedition, and caused Obstructions, Embarrassments and studied Delays, which have finally, lost Us the Province. All these Causes however in Conjunction would not have disappointed Us, if it had not been for a Misfortune, which could not be foreseen, and perhaps could not have been prevented, I mean the Prevalence of the small Pox among our Troops .... This fatal Pestilence  our Destruction. -- It is a Frown of Providence upon Us, which We ought to lay to heart. But on the other Hand, the Delay of this Declaration to this Time, has many great Advantages attending it. -- The Hopes of Reconciliation, which were fondly entertained by Multitudes of honest and well meaning  weak and mistaken People, have been gradually and at last totally extinguished. -- Time has been given for the whole People, maturely to consider the great Question of Independence and to ripen their judgments, dissipate their Fears, and allure their Hopes, by discussing it in News Papers and Pamphletts, by debating it, in Assemblies, Conventions, Committees of Safety and Inspection, in Town and County Meetings, as well as in private Conversations, so that the whole People in every Colony of the 13, have now adopted it, as their own Act. -- This will cement the Union, and avoid those Heats and perhaps Convulsions which might have been occasioned, by such a Declaration Six Months ago. But the Day is past. The Second Day of July 1776, will be the most memorable Epocha, in the History of America. I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated, by succeeding Generations, as the great anniversary Festival. It ought to be commemorated, as the Day of Deliverance by solemn Acts of Devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more. You will think me transported with Enthusiasm but I am not. -- I am well aware of the Toil and Blood and Treasure, that it will cost Us to maintain this Declaration, and support and defend these States. -- Yet through all the Gloom I can see the Rays of ravishing Light and Glory. I can see that the End is more than worth all the Means. And that Posterity will  in that Days Transaction, even altho We should rue it, which I trust in God We shall not. "
"Philadelphia  July 7, 1776
","I have this Moment folded up a Magazine, and an Evening Post and sent it off, by an Express, who could not wait for me to write a single Line. It always goes to my Heart, to send off a  of Pamphletts and News Papers, without a Letter, but it sometimes unavoidably happens, and I suppose you had rather receive a Pamphlet or News Paper, than nothing. The  of our Enemy, now seems to be a powerfull Invasion of  New York and  New Jersey. The  Hallifax Fleet and Army, is arrived, and another Fleet and Army under Lord How, is expected to join them. We are making great Preparations to meet them, by marching the Militia of  Maryland,  Pensilvania, and  New Jersey, down to the Scene of Action, and have made large Requisitions upon  New England. I hope for the Honour of  New England, and the Salvation, of  America, our People will not be backward in marching to  New York. We must maintain and defend that important Post, at all Events. If the Enemy get Possession there, it will cost  N. England very dear. There is no danger of the Small Pox at  New York. It is carefully kept out of the City and the Army. I hope that your Brother and mine too will go into the Service of their Country, at this critical Period of its Distress. Our Army at  Crown Point is an Object of Wretchedness, enough to fill a humane Mind, with Horror. Disgraced, defeated, discontented, dispirited, diseased, naked, undisciplined, eaten up with Vermin -- no Cloaths, Beds, Blanketts, no Medicines, no Victuals, but Salt Pork and flour. A Chaplain from that Army, preached a Sermon here the other day, from ""cursed is he, that doth the Work of the Lord, deceitfully."" I knew better than he did, who the Persons were, who deserved these Curses. But I could not help myself, nor my poor Country any more than he. I hope that Measures will be taken to cleanse the Army at Crown Point from the small Pox, and that other Measures will be taken in  New England, by tolerating and encouraging Inoculation, to render that Distemper less terrible. I am solicitous to hear, what Figure, our new  Court made in their Eastern Circuit. What Business they did? Whether the Grand Juries, and petit Juries, were sworn. Whether they tried any Criminals? or any civil Actions. How the People were affected at the Appearance of Courts again. How the judges were treated, whether with Respect, or cold Neglect &c. Every Colony, upon the Continent will soon be in the same Situation. They are erecting Governments, as fast as Children build Cobb Houses. But I conjecture they will hardly throw them down again, so soon. The Practice We have hitherto been in, of ditching round about our Enemies, will not always do. We must learn to Use other Weapons than the Pick Axe and the Spade. Our Armies must be disciplined and learn to fight. I have the Satisfaction to reflect, that our  Massachusetts People, when they have been left to themselves, have been constantly fighting and skirmishing, and always with success. I wish the same , Prudence, and Spirit had been discovered every where. "
"Philadelphia  July 7, 1776
","It is worth the while of a Person, obliged to write as much as I do, to consider the Varieties of Style .... The Epistolary, is essentially different from the oratorical, and the Historical Style .... Oratory abounds with Figures. History is simple, but grave, majestic and formal. Letters, like Conversation, should be free, easy, and familiar. Simplicity and Familiarity, are the  of this Kind of Writing. Affectation is as disagreable, in a Letter, as in Conversation, and therefore, studied Language, premeditated Method, and sublime Sentiments are not expected in a Letter. Notwithstanding which, the Sublime, as well as the beautifull, and the Novel, may naturally enough, appear, in familiar Letters among Friends. -- Among the ancients there are two illustrious Examples of the Epistolary Style, Cicero and Pliny, whose Letters present you with Modells of fine Writing, which has borne the Criticism of almost two thousand Years. In these, you see the Sublime, the beautifull, the Novel, and the Pathetick, conveyed in as much Simplicity, Ease, Freedom, and Familiarity, as Language is capable of. Let me request you, to turn over the Leaves of the , to a Letter of Pliny the Younger, in which he has transmitted, to these days, the History of his Uncles Philosophical Curiosity, his Heroic Courage and his melancholly Catastrophe. Read it, and say, whether it is possible to write a Narrative of Facts, in a better Manner. It is copious and particular, in selecting the Circumstances, most natural, remarkable and affecting. There is not an incident omitted, which ought to have been remembered, nor one inserted that is not worth Remembrance. It gives you, an Idea of the , as distinct and perfect, as if a Painter had drawn it to the Life, before your Eyes. It interests your Passions, as much as if you had been an Eye Witness of the whole Transaction. Yet there are no Figures, or Art used. All is as simple, natural, easy, and familiar, as if the Story had been told in Conversation, without a Moments Premeditation. Pope and Swift have given the World a Collection of their Letters; but I think in general, they fall short, in the Epistolary Way, of their own Emminence in Poetry and other Branches of Literature. Very few of their Letters, have ever engaged much of my Attention. Gays Letter, concerning the Pair of Lovers  by Lightning, is worth more than the whole Collection, in Point of Simplicity, and Elegance of Composition, and as a genuine Model of the epistolary Style. There is a Book, which I wish you owned, I mean Rollins Belles Letters, in which the Variations of Style are explained. Early Youth is the Time, to learn the Arts and Sciences, and especially to correct the Ear, and the Imagination, by forming a Style. I wish you would think of forming the Taste, and judgment of your Children, now, before any unchaste Sounds have fastened on their Ears, and before any Affectation, or Vanity, is settled on their Minds, upon the pure Principles of Nature .... is a great Advantage, for Style depends in Part upon a delicate Ear. The Faculty of Writing is attainable, by Art, Practice, and Habit only. The sooner, therefore the Practice begins, the more likely it will be to succeed. Have no Mercy upon an affected Phrase, any more than an affected Air, Gate, Dress, or Manners.  Your Children have Capacities equal to any Thing. There is a Vigour in the Understanding, and a Spirit and Fire in the Temper of every one of them, which is capable of ascending the Heights of Art, Science, Trade, War, or Politicks. They should be set to compose Descriptions of  and Objects, and Narrations of Facts and Events, Declamations upon Topicks, and other Exercises of various sorts, should be prescribed to them. Set a Child to form a Description of a Battle, a Storm, a seige, a Cloud, a Mountain, a Lake, a City, an , a Country seat, a Meadow, a Forrest, or almost any Thing, that may occur to your Thoughts. Set him to compose a Narration of all the little Incidents and Events of a Day, a Journey, a Ride, or a Walk. In this Way, a Taste will be formed, and a Facility of Writing acquired. For myself, as I never had a regular Tutor, I never studied any Thing methodically, and consequently never was  accomplished in any Thing. But as I am conscious of my own Deficiency, in these Respects, I should be the less pardonable, if I neglected the Education of my Children. In Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, my Education was imperfect, because unmethodical. Yet I have perhaps read more upon these Arts, and considered them in a more extensive View than some others. "
"June  [i.e. July] 10, 1776","You will see by the Newspapers, which I from time to time , with what Rapidity, the Colonies proceed in their political Maneuvres. How many Calamities might have been avoided if these Measures had been taken twelve Months ago, or even no longer ago than last december? The Colonies to the South, are pursuing the same Maxims, which have heretofore governed those to the North. In constituting their new Governments, their Plans are remarkably popular, more so than I could ever have imagined, even more popular than the ""Thoughts on Government."" And in the Choice of their Rulers, Capacity, Spirit and Zeal in the Cause, supply the Place of Fortune, Family, and every other Consideration, which used to have Weight with Mankind. My Friend Archibald Bullock Esq. is Governor of  Georgia. John Rutledge Esq. is Governor of  South Carolina. Patrick Henry Esq. is Governor of  Virginia &c. Dr. Franklin will be Governor of  . The new Members of this City, are all in this Taste, chosen because of their inflexible Zeal for Independence. All the old Members left out, because they opposed Independence, or at least were lukewarm about it. Dickinson, Morris, Allen, all fallen, like Grass before the Scythe notwithstanding all their vast Advantages in Point of Fortune, Family and Abilities. I am inclined to think however, and to wish that these Gentlemen may be restored, at a fresh Election, because,  mistaken in some Points, they are good Characters, and their great Wealth and numerous Connections, will contribute to strengthen  America, and cement her Union. I wish I were at perfect Liberty, to  before you, all those Characters, in their genuine Lights, and to explain to you the Course of political Changes in this Province. It would give you a great Idea of the Spirit and Resolution of the People, and shew you, in a striking point of View, the deep Roots of American Independence in all the Colonies. But it is not prudent, to commit to Writing such free Speculations, in the present State of Things. Time which takes away the Veil, may lay open the secret Springs of this  Revolution .... But I find, altho the Colonies have differed in Religion, Laws, Customs, and Manners, yet in the great Essentials of Society and Government, they are all alike. "
"Philadelphia  July 11, 1776
","You seem to be situated in the Place of greatest Tranquility and Security, of any upon the Continent . ... I may be mistaken in this particular, and an Armament may have invaded your  before now. But We have no Intelligence of any such Design and all that We now know of the Motions, Plans, Operations, and Designs of the Enemy, indicates the Contrary. -- It is but just that you should have a little Rest, and take a little Breath. I wish I knew whether your Brother and mine have  in the Army, and what Spirit is manifested by our Militia, for marching to  New York and  Crown Point .... The Militia of  Maryland,  New Jersey,  Pensilvania, and the lower Counties, are marching with much Alacrity, and a laudable Zeal, to take Care of Howe and his Army at  Staten Island. The Army in  New York is in high Spirits, and seems determined to give the Enemy a serious Reception. The unprincipled, and unfeeling, and unnatural Inhabitants of  Staten Island, are cordially receiving the Enemy, and Deserters say have engaged to take Arms. -- They are an ignorant, cowardly, Pack of . Their Numbers are small, and their Spirit less. It is some Time, since I received any Letter from you; the  Plymouth one was the last. You must write me, every Week by the Post. If it is but a few Lines, it gives me many Spirits. I design to write to the General Court, requesting a Dismission, or at least a Furlow. I think to propose that they choose four more Members or at least two more, that so We may attend here in Rotation. Two or three or four may be at home at a Time, and the Colony properly represented notwithstanding. -- Indeed, while the Congress were employed in political Regulations, forming the Sentiments of the People of the Colonies into some consistent System, extinguishing the Remainders of Authority under the Crown, and gradually erecting and strengthening Governments, under the Authority of the People, turning their Thoughts upon the Principles of Polity and the Forms of Government, framing Constitutions for the Colonies , and a limited and defined Confederacy, for the united Colonies, and in some other Measures, which I do not choose to mention particularly, but which are now determined, or near the Point of Determination, I flattered myself that I might have been of some little Use here. But, now, these Matters will be soon compleated, and very little Business will be to be done here, but what will be either military or Commercial, Branches of Knowledge and Business, for which hundreds of others in our Province, are much better qualified than I am.  I shall therefore request my Masters to relieve me. I am not a little concerned about my Health which seems to have been providentially preserved to me, much beyond my Expectations. But I begin to feel the  Effects, of unremitting Attention to Business for so long a Time; and a Want of Exercise, and the bracing Quality of my Native Air: so that I have the Utmost Reason to fear an irreparable Injury to my Constitution, if I do not obtain a little Relaxation. The Fatigues of War, are much less destructive to Health, than the  laborious Attention, to Debates, and to Writing, which drinks up the Spirits and consumes the Strength. -- I am &c. "
"Philadelphia  July 15. 1776
","My very deserving Friend, Mr. Gerry,  off, tomorrow, for  Boston, worn out of Health, by the Fatigues of this station. He is an excellent Man, and an active able statesman. I hope he will soon return hither. I am sure I should be glad to go with him, but I cannot. I must write to have the Guard relieved. There is a most amiable, , and gallant Spirit prevailing, in these middle Colonies. The Militia turn out in great Numbers and in high Spirits, in  New Jersey,  Pensilvania,  Maryland, and Delaware, so that We hope to resist Howe and his Mirimidons. Independence is at last unanimously agreed to in the  New York Convention. You will see by the Newspapers  what is going forward in  Virginia, and  Maryland and New Jersey. Farewell! farewell, infatuated, besotted Stepdame. I have not Time to add, more than that I receive Letters from you but seldom of late. Tomorrows Post I hope will bring me some. So I hoped of last Saturdays and last Tuesdays. "

","In a Letter from your , and in another from Mr. Mason which I received by this days Post I am informed that you were about taking the Small Pox, with all the Children . . . . It is not possible for me to describe, nor for you to conceive my Feelings upon this Occasion. Nothing, but the critical State of our Affairs should prevent me from flying to  Boston, to your Assistance. I mentioned your Intention to Mrs. Yard at noon. This Evening our President was here. I was engaged abroad, the whole Evening till it was late. When I came home, I found the  Card from the President. I have not yet had an Opportunity to thank Mr. Hancock for his Politeness, which in this Instance is very obliging, but I shall take the first opportunity of doing it, and of informing him, that your Uncles Kindness of which I shall ever entertain the most gratefull Sentiments, has rendered it unnecessary, as well as improper, for you to accept of his most generous Offer. I can do no more than wish and pray for your Health, and that of the Children. Never -- Never in my whole Life, had I so many Cares upon my Mind at once. I should have been happier, if I had received my Letters, before Mr. Gerry went away this Morning, because I should have written more by him. -- I rely upon the tender Care of our Friends.  and your Uncle Quincy, and my Brother will be able to visit you, and give you any Assistance. Our other Friends, I doubt not will give you every Advice, Consolation and Aid in their Power. -- I am very anxious about supplying you with Money. Spare for nothing, if you can get Friends to lend it you. I will repay with Gratitude as well as Interest, any sum that you may borrow. -- I shall feel like a Savage to be here, while my whole Family is sick at  Boston. But it cannot be avoided. I cannot leave this Place, without more Injury to the public now, than I ever could at any other Time, being in the Midst of scaenes of Business, which must not stop for any Thing .... Make Mr. Mason, Mr. any Body write to me, by every Post -- dont miss one for any Cause whatever. --  My dearest Love to you all. "
"Philadelphia  July 20, 1776
","I cannot omit the Opportunity of writing you, a Line, by this Post. This Letter will I suppose, find you, in some degree or other, under the Influence of the Small Pox. The Air is of very great Importance. I dont know your , but I hope he wont deprive you of Air, more than is necessary. We had Yesterday, an express from , in  Charlestown South Carolina, with an Account of a brilliant little Action between the Armament under Clinton, and Cornwallis, and a Battery on  Sullivans Island. Which terminated very fortunately for  America. I will endeavour to inclose, with this a printed Account of it. It has given Us good Spirits here and will have an happy Effect, upon our Armies at  New York and  Ticonderoga. Surely our northern Soldiers will not suffer themselves to be outdone by their Brethren so nearly under the Sun. I dont yet hear of any  Massachusetts Men, at  New York. Our People must not flinch, at this critical Moment, when their Country is in more danger, than it ever will be again perhaps. What will they say, if the Howes should prevail against our Forces, at so important a Post as  New York for Want of a few Thousand Men from the  Massachusetts? I will likewise send you, by this Post,  Letter and Proclamation, which has let the Cat out of the Bag. -- These Tricks deceive no longer. Gentlemen here, who either were  or pretended to be deceived heretofore, now see or pretend to see, through such Artifices. I apprehend, his Lordship is afraid of being attacked upon  Staten Island, and is throwing out his Barrells to amuse Leviathan, untill his Reinforcement shall arrive. "
"Philadelphia  July 20. 1776
","This has been a dull day to me: I waited the Arrival of the Post with much Solicitude and Impatience, but his Arrival made me more solicitous still. -- ""To be left at the Post Office"" in your Hand Writing, on the back of a few Lines from the  were all that I could learn of you, and my little Folks. If you was too busy to write, I hoped that some kind Hand would have been found to let me know something about you. Do my Friends think that I have been a Politician so long as to have lost all feeling? Do they suppose I have forgotten my Wife and Children? Or are they so panic struck with the Loss of  Canada, as to be afraid to correspond with me? Or have they forgotten that you have an Husband and your Children a Father? What have I done, or omitted to do, that I should be thus forgotten and neglected in the most tender and affecting  of my Life! Dont mistake me, I dont blame you. Your Time and Thoughts must have been wholly taken up, with your own and your Families situation and Necessities. -- But twenty other Persons might have informed me. I suspect, that you intended to have run slyly, through the small Pox with the family, without letting me know it, and then have sent  me an Account that you were all well. This might be a kind Intention, and if the design had succeeded, would have made me very joyous. But the secret is out, and I am left to conjecture. But as the Faculty have this distemper so much under Command I will flatter myself with the Hope and Expectation of soon hearing of your Recovery. "
"July 23, 1776","This Mornings Post brought me  yours of July 13 and 14  and has relieved me from an huge Load of Anxiety. -- Am happy to hear that you are so comfortably situated, have so much  Company, and such fine Accommodations. I would very joyfully agree to have the small Pox, over again, for the Sake of the Company. Since the  Letters of July   and 4th. [No letter written by JA on 4 July 1776 is known, but JA sent  a second letter on 3 July .]  which you say you have received, I have written to you of the following dates.  Two Letters July 7   --  July 10.   11. 15.   16.   Two Letters of July 20th.   -- This Morning I inclosed a Letter from Dr. Rush to me, containing Directions for managing Patients under Inocculation for the small Pox.Rush has as much success as any without Exception. You will find several dull Hours, and the Children will fatigue you. But if you had sent me a Present of an hundred Guineas, it would not have pleased me so much as to hear that Nurse is there. You cant be low spirited, while she is there, and you cant possibly suffer for Want of Care. But I am somewhat afraid you have not Nurses and Servants enough in the House for so large an Hospital. I dont know how I can better entertain you, than by giving you some Idea of the Character of this Dr. Rush. -- He is a Native of this Place, a Gentleman of an ingenious Turn of Mind, and of elegant Accomplishments. He has travelled in  England, where he was acquainted with Mrs. Maccaulay, with whom he corresponded while there, and since his Return. He wrote an elegant, flowing Letter to her, while he was in  England, concerning a Plan of  a Republic which she wrote and addressed to Pascal Paoli. He afterwards travelled in  France, and contracted a Friendship there with M. Dubourg, with whom he has corresponded ever since. He has published several Things upon Philosophy, Medicine, and Politicks, in this City. He is a Lecturer in the Colledge here, in some Branch of Physick or surgery, and is a Member of the American Philosophical Society. He has been sometime a Member of the City Committee and was last Week appointed a Delegate in Congress for this Place, in the Room of one, who was left out. He married last Winter, a young Lady, daughter of Mr. Stockton of New Jersey, one of the judges of the Supream Court of that Government, and lately appointed a delegate in this Congress. This Gentleman is said to be a staunch American, I suppose, truly. Dr. Cooper has promised me, to visit you, and contribute all in his Power to amuse you and make your Stay . I love him the more for this Kindness. I loved him much before. Dont give yourself the least Pain about an incurable Lameness. Sell or give away the Creature, to a good Master; or keep her for the good she has done, and let her enjoy Life, in Ease for the future. -- How shall I get home?  I feel every generous Passion and every kind sentiment, rushing for Utterance, while I subscribe myself yours. "

","Disappointed again. -- The Post brought me no Letter from you, which I dont wonder at much, nor any Intelligence concerning you, which  me, a good deal . . . . I hang upon Tenterhooks. Fifteen days since, you were all inocculated, and I have not yet learned how you have fared. But I will suppose you all better and out of Danger. Why should I torture myself when I cant relieve you? It makes me happy to hear that the Spirit of  prevails so generally. I could wish it, more universal. The small Pox has done Us more harm than British Armies, Canadians, Indians, Negroes, Hannoverians, Hessians, and all the rest. We must conquer this formidable Enemy without Hesitation or delay.  is here, and in a Miff, at the Promotion of Gates, has asked Leave to resign his Commission. I am sorry for this inconsiderate Step. It will hurt him more than the Cause. It is conjectured at  New York, I am told, that he expects to be first Man in  New Hampshire. If this is really his Motive, he ought to be ashamed of it, and I hope he will be dissappointd. -- The Ladies have not half the Zeal for Precedence, that We find every day among the Gentlemen. The  Advocate came in this Morning Evening, in fine Health and gay Spirits. The Army is the Place for Health -- the Congress the Place of Sickness. -- God bless you all. "
"Philadelphia  July 29, 1776
","How are you all this Morning? Sick, weak, faint, in Pain; or pretty well recovered? By this Time, you are well acquainted with the Small Pox. Pray how do you like it? We have no News. It is very hard that half a dozen or half a Score Armies cant supply Us, with News. We have a Famine, a perfect Dearth of this necessary Article. I am at this present Writing perplexed and plagued with two knotty Problems in . You love to pick a political Bone, so I will even throw it to you. If a Confederation should take Place, one great Question is how We shall vote. Whether each Colony shall count one? or whether each shall have a Weight in Proportion to its Numbers, or Wealth, or Exports and Imports, or a compound Ratio of all? Another is whether Congress shall have Authority to limit the Dimensions of each Colony, to prevent those which claim, by Charter, or Proclamation, or Commission to the South Sea, from growing too great and , so as to be dangerous to the rest. Shall I write you a Sheet upon each of these Questions. When you are well enough to read, and I can find Leisure enough to write, perhaps I may. Gerry carried with him a  for you. But he is an old Batchelor, and what is worse a Politician, and what is worse still a kind of Soldier, so that I suppose he will have so much Curiosity to see Armies and Fortifications and Assemblies, that you will loose many a fine Breakfast at a Time when you want them most. Tell Betcy that this same Gerry is such another, as herself, Sex excepted. -- How is my Brother and Friend Cranch. How is his other Self, and their little Selves. And ours. Dont be in the Dumps, above all Things. I am hard put to it, to keep out of them, when I look at home. But I will be gay, if I can. "
"Philadelphia  July 30, 1776 Tuesday
","This is one of my fortunate days. The Post brought me, a Letter from you and another from my Friend and Brother. The particular Account you give me of the Condition of each of the Children is very obliging. I hope the next Post will inform me, that you are all, in a fine Way of Recovery. You say I must tell you of my Health and Situation. As to the latter, my Situation is as far removed from Danger, I suppose, as yours. I never had an Idea of Danger here, nor a single Sensation of Fear. Delaware River is so well fortified with Gallies, fixed and floating Batteries, Chevaux de Frizes, Ships of War, Fire Ships, and Fire Rafts, that I have no Suspicions of an Enemy from Sea, although vast Numbers of People have removed out of this City, into the Country, for fear of one. By Land, an Enemy must march an hundred Miles, to get here, and they must pass through, Woods, Difiles, and Morasses, besides crossing Rivers, which would take them a long time to accomplish, if We had not a single Man to oppose them. But we have a  Army at  New York, and New Jersey, watching their Motions, who will give Us a good Account of their Motions, I presume, whenever they shall think fit to stirr. -- My Health has lasted longer than I expected, but with Intermissions of Disorder as usual, and at length, I fear, is departing. Increase of Heat in the Weather, and of Perplexity in Business, if that is possible, have become too much for me. These Circumstances, added to my Concern, for those other Parts of myself in  Boston, would certainly have carried me there before now, if I could have got there: But I have no servant, nor Horse. -- I am now determined to go home: but the  precise Time, I cannot fix. I know not how to go. I have been deliberating whether to go by the stage to  New York, and trust to the Chapter of Accidents to get from thence to  Boston; or whether to hire, or purchase an Horse here, or whether to get along some other Way, with Coll. Whipple, or Mr. S. Adams. But am still undetermined. If I knew that Bass was at Leisure, and if I knew where you could get Horses, I should request you to send him here, to bring me home. But I dont know what to say. If he should come, he must keep a good look out, and make a strict Enquiry all along the Road, for me, least he should miss me, least I should pass by him on my Way home. After all, I cannot reconcile myself to the Thoughts of staying here so long as will be necessary for a servant and Horses to come for me. I must get along as well as I can by the Stage or by procuring a Horse here. The Conspiracy, at  New York, betrayed the Ignorance, Folly, Timidity and Impotence of the Conspirators, at the same Time, that it disclosed the Turpitude of their Hearts. They had no Plan. They corrupted one another, and engaged to Act, when the Plan should be formed. This they left for an After Consideration. The Tory Interest in America, is  feeble. Your Successes by Sea, give me great Pleasure, and so did the heartfelt Rejoicings at the Proclamation of Freedom. Mr. Bowdoins Sentiment did him . "
"Aug. 3, 1776","The Post was later than usual , so that I had not  yours of July 24  till this Evening. You have made me very happy, by the particular and favourable Account you give me of all the Family. But I dont understand how there are so many who have no Eruptions, and no Symptoms. The Inflammation in the Arm might do, but without these, there is no small Pox. I will lay a Wager, that your whole Hospital have not had so much small Pox, as Mrs. Katy Quincy. Upon my Word she has had an Abundance of it, but is finely recovered, looks as fresh as a Rose, but pitted all over, as thick as ever you saw any one. I this Evening presented your Compliments and Thanks to Mr. Hancock for his polite offer of his House, and likewise your Compliments to his Lady and Mrs. Katy. Went this Morning to the Baptist Meeting, in Hopes of hearing Mr. Stillman, but was . He was there, but another Gentleman preached. His Action was violent to a degree bordering on fury. His Gestures, unnatural, and distorted. Not the least Idea of Grace in his Motions, or Elegance in his Style. His Voice was vociferous and boisterous, and his Composition almost wholly destitute of Ingenuity. I wonder extreamly at the Fondness of our People for schollars educated at the Southward and for southern Preachers. There is no one Thing, in which We excell them more, than in our University, our schollars, and Preachers. Particular Gentlemen here, who have improved upon their Education by Travel, shine. But in general, old Massachusetts outshines her younger sisters, still. In several Particulars, they have more Wit, than We.  They have Societies; the philosophical Society particularly, which excites a scientific Emulation, and propagates their Fame. If ever I get through this Scene of Politicks and War, I will spend the Remainder of my days, in endeavouring to instruct my Countrymen in the Art of making the most of their Abilities and Virtues, an Art, which they have hitherto, too much neglected. A philosophical society shall be established at  Boston, if I have Wit and Address enough to accomplish it, sometime or other. -- Pray set Brother Cranch's Philosophical Head to plodding upon this Project. Many of his Lucubrations would have been published and preserved, for the Benefit of Mankind, and for his Honour, if such a Clubb had existed. My Countrymen want Art and Address. They want Knowledge of the World. They want the  and superficial Accomplishments of Gentlemen, upon which the World has foolishly set so high a Value. In solid Abilities and real Virtues, they vastly excell in general, any People upon this Continent. Our  N. England People are Aukward and bashfull; yet they are pert, ostentatious and vain, a Mixture which excites Ridicule and gives Disgust. They have not the faculty of shewing themselves to the best Advantage, nor the Art of concealing this faculty. An Art and Faculty which some People possess in the highest degree. Our Deficiencies in these Respects, are owing wholly to the little Intercourse We have had with strangers, and to our  Inexperience in the World. These Imperfections must be remedied, for  New England must produce the Heroes, the statesmen, the Philosophers, or  America will make no great Figure for some Time. Our Army is rather sickly at  N. York, and We live in daily Expectation of hearing of some great Event. May God almighty grant it may be prosperous for America. -- Hope is an Anchor and a Cordial. Disappointment however will not  disconcert me. If you will come to  Philadelphia in September, I will stay, as long as you please. I should be as proud and happy as a Bridegroom.  Yours. "
"Philadelphia  August 6, 1776
","Yours of 29 July  came by this days Post, and made me very happy. , Charles, and Tommy, will have the small Pox, well, I dont doubt. Tell John he is a very lucky young Gentleman, to have it so much better, than his Mamma, his sister, and Brothers. Mr.  will set out for  Boston, on Monday, the 12. of August. I shall write by him. But I will not neglect Writing a few Lines by the Post. -- I have written a Resignation of my Place here, to the General Court, sometime ago, but it seems, they were adjourned, and therefore will not be able to consider the Matter, untill the 28 of this Month, when they will send some other Person here in my Stead. -- How I am to get home I dont know. When I see how Mr. A. goes, I will write you more particularly upon the subject. Whether to hire a Horse here, or to have a Man and two Horses come for me, I am not determined, must leave all undetermined at present. I want the Exercise of a journey so much, that I must return soon. The General Court will appoint some one to relieve me, I hope, the first Thing they do, after they come together. I shall take it for granted, that they will sett off, accordingly. My Health is so infirm that I can stay no longer. We are in daily Expectation of some decisive Stroke at  N. York. Dunmore has fled from  , and Clinton from  Charlestown, and both have joined How, at  Staten Island. "
"Aug. 10, 76","Yours of 30. and 31 July  was brought me, , by Captain Cazneau. I am happy to think that you, and my oldest son, are well through the distemper, and have sufficient Receipts. Nabby, I believe is also through. The Inflammation in her Arm, and the single Eruption, are nearly as much Evidence, as I had to shew -- and I have seen Small Pox enough since I had it, to have infected 100 Armies. Tommy, I shall hear by next Post, is happily recoverd of it, I think. Charley, my dear Charley! I am sorry, that it is still pretty clear, that you have not taken it. But never fear, you will have it. This  and Uncertainty must be very irksome to you. But Patience and Perseverance, will overcome this, as well as all other Difficulties. Dont think of Time, nor Expence. 1000 Guineas is not worth so much as security to a Wife, a good one I mean, and four Children, good ones I mean, against the small Pox. It is an important Event in a Mans Life, to go thro that distemper. It is a very great Thing, for a whole Family, to get well over it. At the same Time that I am in a State of , Uncertainty and Anxiety about my best, dearest, worthyest, wisest Friend, in this World, and all my Children, I am in a State of equal Suspence, Uncertainty, and Anxiety about our Army at  N. York and  Ticonderoga, and consequently about our Country and Posterity. The Lives of Thousands, and the Liberties of Millions are as much in Suspence, as the Health of my family. But I submit to the Governance of infinite Wisdom. Had my Advice been followed, in Season, We should now have been in Safety, Liberty and Peace, or at least We should have had a clear and indisputable Superiority of Power. But my Advice was not regarded. It never was, and never will be, in this World. Had  N.Y.,  N.J. and  Pensilvania, only been in compleat Possession of the Powers of Government Only 3 Months sooner, We should have had an Army, at  N.Y. and Amboy, able to cope with double the Number of our Enemies. But now We trust to Chance: to the Chapter of Accidents: a long Chapter it is, as long as the 119 Psalm: and well it is for us that it is so. If We trusted to Providence, I should be easy, but We do not. I have now come to a Resolution, upon another Subject, which has kept me in  for some Time. -- I must request of you, to interceed with your Father to procure for me, two Horses, and send them to  Philadelphia, with a servant, as soon as possible. I shall wait for their Arrival, let it be sooner or later. The sooner they come, the more agreable to my Wishes, and the better for my Health. I can live no longer, without Riding. If Bass is in the land of the living, and is willing to take one more Ride with his old Friend, let him come, if he declines, send somebody else. I shall wait for Horses. If the Congress should adjourn, I shall attend the Board of War, untill they come. The General Court, I think might do something. Whether they have ever thought of granting me, a farthing, for my Time, I know not. Mr. A. had an Horse and a fine Chaise, furnished him, by the Committee of Supplies. Perhaps they might furnish me with a Pair of Horses too. -- Pray mention this to Coll. Warren or Coll. Palmer. -- If nothing can be done by them, if I have Credit enough left, to hire two Horses and a servant, let it be employed. The Loss of my fine Mare, has disconcerted me. The General Court will send some Gentleman here to take my Place. But if my Horses come I shall not wait for that. "
"Aug. 12, 76","Mr. A.  off, to day, if the Rain should not prevent him, with Coll. Whipple of  Portsmouth: a Brother of the celebrated Miss Hannah Whipple, a sensible and worthy Man. By him I have sent you two Bundles of Letters, which I hope you will be carefull of. I thought I should not be likely to find a safer opportunity. By them, you will see that my private Correspondence alone, is Business enough for a lazy Man. I think I have answered all but a few of those large Bundles. A french , a pretty large Brigantine, deeply loaden, arrived here yesterday from  Martinique. She had 50 Barrells of Limes, which are all sold already, at such Prices, that the Amount of them will be sufficient to load the Brig with Flour. A Trade We see, even now, in the midst of summer is not totally interrupted, by all the Efforts of our Enemies. Prizes are taken in no small Numbers. A Gentleman told me a few days ago that he had summed up the sugar, which has been taken, and it amounted to 3000 Hdds. since which two other ships have been taken and carried into  Maryland. Thousands of schemes for Privateering are afloat in American Imaginations. Some are for taking the Hull ships, with Woolens for  Amsterdam and  Rotterdam -- some are for the Tin ships -- some for the Irish  ships -- some for outward Bound and others for Inward Bound  India Men -- some for the  Hudsons Bay ships -- and many for  West India sugar ships. Out of these Speculations many fruitless and some profitable Projects will grow. We have no News from  New York. All is quiet there as yet. Our Expectations are raised -- the Eyes of the World are upon  Washington and , and their Armies. The Wishes and Prayers of the virtuous Part of it, I hope, will be answerd. If not, yet Virtues grow out of Affliction. I repeat my request, that you would ask some of the Members of the  Court if they can send me Horses, and if they cannot that you would send them. I can live no longer without a servant, and a Horse. "
Aug. 12 76,"Mr. A. and  Whipple, are at length gone. Coll. Tudor went off with them. They went away, about Three o Clock this afternoon. I wrote by A and Coll. Whipple too. By the latter I sent two large Bundles, which he promised to deliver to you. These middle States begin to taste the Sweets of War. Ten Thousand Difficulties and wants occur, which they had no Conception of before. Their Militia are as clamorous, and impatient of Discipline, and mutinous as ours, and more so. There has been seldom less than four Thousand Men in this City at a Time, for a fortnight past, on their March to  New Jersey. Here they wait  We grow very angry, about them, for Canteens, Camp Kettles, Blanketts, Tents, Shoes, Hose, Arms, Flints, and other Dittoes, while We are under a very critical Solicitude for our Army at  New York, on Account of the Insufficiency of Men. I want to be informed of the State of Things with you. Whether there is a Scarcity of Provisions of any Kind, of  West India Articles, of . Whether any Trade is carried on, any Fishery. Whether any Vessells arrive from abroad, or whether any go to sea, upon foreign Voyages. I wish to know likewise, what Posture of  you are in. What Fortifications are at  Nantaskett, at  Long Island,  Petticks Island &c. and what Men and Officers there are to garrison them. We hear nothing from the  Massachusetts, lately, in Comparason of what We did, when the Army was before  Boston. I must not conclude without repeating my Request, that you would ask some of the Members of the General Court to send me Horses -- and if they cannot, to send them yourself. "

","This is the Anniversary of a memorable day, in the History of  America: a day when the Principle of American Resistance and Independence, was first asserted, and carried into Action. The Stamp Office fell before the rising Spirit of our Countrymen. -- It is not impossible that the two  Brothers may make their grand Attack this very day: if they should, it is possible it may be more glorious for this Country, than ever: it is certain it will become more memorable. Your  of August 1.  and  5.  came by Yesterdays Post. I congratulate you all upon your agreable Prospects. Even my pathetic little Hero Charles, I hope will have the Distemper finely. It is very odd that the Dr. cant put Infection enough into his Veigns, nay it is unaccountable to me that he has not taken it, in the natural Way before now. I am under little Apprehension, prepared as he is, if he should. I am concerned about you, much more. So many Persons about you, sick. The Children troublesome -- your Mind perplexed -- yourself weak and relaxed. The Situation must be disagreable. The Country Air, and Exercise however, will refresh you. I am put upon a Committee to prepare a Device for a Golden Medal to commemorate the Surrender of  Boston to the American Arms, and upon another to prepare  Devices for a Great Seal for the confederated States. There is a Gentleman here of French Extraction, whose Name is Du simitiere, a Painter by Profession whose Designs are very ingenious, and his Drawings well executed. He has been applied to for his Advice. I waited on him yesterday, and saw his Sketches. For the Medal he proposes Liberty with her Spear and Pileus, leaning on General Washington. The British Fleet in  Boston Harbour, with all their Sterns towards the Town, the American Troops, marching in. For the Seal he proposes. The Arms of the several Nations from whence  America has been peopled, as English, Scotch, Irish, Dutch, German &c. each in a Shield. On one side of them Liberty, with her Pileus, on the other a Rifler, in his Uniform, with his Rifled Gun in one Hand, and his Tomahauk, in the other. This Dress and these Troops with this Kind of Armour, being peculiar to  America -- unless the Dress was known to the Romans. Dr.  [Franklin ]shewed me, yesterday, a Book, containing an Account of the Dresses of all the Roman Soldiers, one of which, appeared exactly like it. This Mr. Du simitiere is a very curious Man. He has begun a Collection of Materials for an History of this Revolution. He begins with the first Advices of the Tea Ships. He  out of the Newspapers, every Scrap of Intelligence, and every Piece of Speculation, and pastes it upon clean Paper, arranging them under the Head of the State to which they belong and intends to bind them up in Volumes. He has a List of every Speculation and Pamphlet concerning Independence, and another of those concerning Forms of Government. Dr. F. proposes a Device for a Seal. Moses lifting up his Wand, and  dividing the Red Sea, and Pharaoh, in his Chariot overwhelmed with the Waters. -- This Motto. Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God. Mr. Jefferson proposed. The Children of  Israel in the Wilderness, led by a Cloud by day, and a Pillar of Fire by night, and on the other Side Hengist and Horsa, the Saxon Chiefs, from whom We claim the  of being descended and whose Political Principles and Form of Government We have assumed. I proposed the Choice of Hercules, as engraved by Gribeline in some Editions of Lord Shaftsburys Works. The Hero resting on his . Virtue pointing to her rugged Mountain, on one Hand, and perswading him to ascend. Sloth, glancing at her flowery Paths of Pleasure, wantonly reclining on the Ground, displaying the Charms both of her Eloquence and Person, to seduce him into Vice. But this is too complicated a Group for a Seal or Medal, and it is not original. I shall conclude by repeating my Request for Horses and a servant. Let the Horses be good ones. I cant ride a bad Horse, so many hundred Miles. If our Affairs had not been in so critical a state at  N. York, I should have run away before now. But I am determined now to stay,  some Gentleman is sent here in my Room, and untill my Horses come. But the Time will be very tedious. The whole Force is arrived at  Staten Island. "

","My Letters to you are an odd Mixture. They would appear to a Stranger, like the Dish which is sometimes called Omnium Gatherum. This is the first Time, I believe that these two Words were ever put together in Writing. The  Interpretation of them, I take to be ""A Collection of all Things."" But as I said before, the Words having never before been written, it is not possible to be very learned in telling you what the Arabic, Syriac, Chaldaic, Greek and Roman Commentators say upon the Subject. Amidst all the Rubbish that constitutes the Heap, you will see a Proportion of Affection, for my Friends, my Family and Country, that gives a Complexion to the whole. I have a very tender feeling Heart. This Country knows not, and never can know the Torments, I have endured for its sake. I am glad they never can know, for it would give more Pain to the benevolent and humane, than I could wish, even the wicked and malicious to feel. I have seen in this World, but a little of that pure flame of Patriotism, which certainly burns in some Breasts. There is much of the Ostentation and Affectation of it. I have known a few who could not bear to entertain a selfish design, nor to be suspected by others of such a Meanness. But these are not the most respected by the World. A Man must be selfish, even to acquire great Popularity. He must grasp for himself, under specious Pretences, for the public Good, and he must attach himself to his Relations, Connections and Friends, by becoming a Champion for their Interests, in order to form a Phalanx, about him for  his own defence; to make them Trumpeters of his Praise, and sticklers for his Fame, Fortune, and Honour. My Friend Warren, the late Governor Ward, and Mr. Gadsden, are three Characters in which I have seen the most generous disdain of every Spice and Species of such Meanness. The two last had not great abilities, but they had pure Hearts. Yet they had less Influence, than many others who had neither so considerable Parts, nor any share at all of their Purity of Intention. Warren has both Talents and Virtues beyond most Men in this World, yet his Character has never been in Proportion. Thus it always is, has been, and will be. Nothing has ever given me, more Mortification, than a suspicion, that has been propagated of me, that I  was actuated by private Views, and have been aiming at high Places. The Office of  [Chief Justice] has occasioned this jealousy, and it never will be allayed, untill I resign it. Let me have my Farm, Family and Goose Quil, and all the Honours and Offices this World has to bestow, may go to those who deserve them better, and desire them more. I covet them not. There are very few People in this World, with whom I can bear to converse. I can treat all with Decency and Civility, and converse with them, when it is necessary, on Points of Business. But I am never happy in their Company. This has made me a Recluse, and will one day, make me an Hermit. I had rather build stone Wall upon  Penns Hill, than be the first Prince in  Europe, the first General, or first senator in  America. Our Expectations are very high of some great Affair at  N. York.

","Yours without a Date, but written, as I suppose about the  Twelfth of August  came by the Post this Morning. I wish  joy that she has at last a Receipt in full. This is much better than to be in doubt. Charles! never fear, Charles! you will have it yet, and as good a Receipt as any of them. The Drs. cannot account for the numerous Failures of . I can. No Phisician has either Head or Hands enough to attend a Thousand Patients. He can neither see that the Matter is good, nor that the Thread is properly covered with it, nor that the Incision is properly made, nor any Thing else. I wish you had taken Dr. Tufts for your Phisician and no other. I never liked your Man, and I like him now less than ever. I wish you had all come to  Philadelphia, and had the Distemper here. Then I should not be uneasy about getting home. -- I beg Pardon for this Flight about your Dr. I may have done him Wrong. But am afraid you have suffered from his being of rather too much Importance, in the present Scarcity of Phisicians. With Regard to my Health, as the  Heat of the Weather has abated, I am better than I was, but not well. I am so comfortable however, as to be determined to wait for a servant and Horses. Horses are so intollerably dear, at this Place, that it will not do for me to purchase one, here. And our Representation is so thin, that it will not do for me to leave this Place, untill another comes in my Room. I have received a very polite Letter from Mrs. Temple, which I shall answer by the next Post. I wish that something may be done for her Relief, but it will  be attended with such Difficulties, that I can promise nothing. I have the Pleasure of congratulating her upon Mr. Temples Arrival. Congress was informed of it, two days ago by the General, and I suppose by this Time, he is on his Way to  Ten Hills. Lord Howe seems afraid to attack and has got to the old Work of Amusement and Chicanery. But he cannot catch old Birds. They are aware of the snare. "
"Philadelphia  August 21, 1776
","Yesterday Morning I took a Walk, into Arch Street, to see Mr. Peele's Painters Room. Peele is from  Maryland, a tender, soft, affectionate Creature .... He  me a large Picture containing a Group of Figures, which upon Inquiry I found were his Family. His Mother, and his Wifes Mother, himself and his Wife, his Brothers and sisters, and his Children, Sons and Daughters all young. There was a pleasant, a happy Chearfulness in their Countenances, and a Familiarity in their Airs towards each other. He  me one moving Picture. His Wife, all bathed in Tears, with a Child about six months old, laid out, upon her Lap. This Picture struck me prodigiously. He has a Variety of Portraits -- very well done. But not so well as  Portraits. Copeley is the greatest Master, that ever was in  America. His Portraits far exceed Wests. Peele has taken General Washington, Dr. Franklin, Mrs. Washington, Mrs. Rush, Mrs. Hopkinson. Mr. Blair McClenachan and his little Daughter in one Picture. His Lady and her little son, in another. Peele  me some Books upon the Art of Painting, among  the rest one by Sir Joshua Reynolds, the President of the English Accademy of Painters, by whom the Pictures of General Conway and Coll. Barry  [Barre] in  Fanuil Hall were taken. He  me too a great Number of Miniature Pictures, among the rest Mr. Hancock and his Lady -- Mr. Smith, of  S.C. whom you saw the other day in  Boston -- Mr. Custis, and many others. He  me, likewise, Draughts, or rather Sketches of Gentlemen's Seats in  Virginia, where he had been -- Mr. Corbins, Mr. Pages, General Washingtons &c. Also a Variety of rough Drawings, made by great Masters in  Italy, which he keeps as . He  me, several Imitations of Heads, which he had made in Clay, as large as the Life, with his Hands only. Among the Rest one of his own Head and Face, which was a great Likeness. He is ingenious. He has Vanity -- loves Finery -- Wears a sword -- gold Lace -- speaks French -- is capable of Friendship, and strong Family Attachments and natural Affections. At this shop I met Mr. Francis Hopkinson, late a Mandamus Councillor of  New Jersey, now a Member of the Continental Congress, who it seems is a Native of  Philadelphia, a son of a Prothonotary of this County who was a Person much respected. The son was liberally educated, and is a Painter and a Poet. I have a Curiosity to penetrate a little deeper into the Bosom of this curious Gentleman, and may possibly give you some more particulars concerning him .... He is one of your pretty little, curious, ingenious Men. His Head is not bigger, than a large Apple -- less than our Friend Pemberton or Dr. Simon Tufts. I have not met with  in natural History much more amusing and entertaining, than his personal Appearance. Yet he is genteel and well bred, and is very social. I wish I had Leisure, and Tranquility of Mind to amuse myself with these Elegant, and ingenious Arts of Painting, Sculpture, Statuary, Architecture, and . But I have not. A Taste in all of them, is an agreable Accomplishment. Mr. Hopkinson has taken in Crayons, with his own Hand, a Picture of Miss Keys, a famous  New Jersey Beauty. He talks of bringing it to Town, and in that Case I shall see it, I hope. "
"Philadelphia  August 25, 1776
","The day before Yesterday and Yesterday, We expected Letters and Papers by the Post, but by some Accident, or Mismanagement of the Riders, no Post is arrived yet, which has been a great Disappointment to me. I watch, with longing Eyes for the Post, because you have been very good of late in writing by every one. I long to hear, that  is in as fair a Way, thro the Distemper as the rest of you. Poor Barrell is violently ill, in the next Chamber to mine, of an inflammatory Fever. I hear every Cough, Sigh, and Groan. His Fate hangs in a critical , the least Thing may turn the Scale against him. Miss  [Katharine] Quincy is here, very humanely employed in nursing him. This Goodness does her Honour. Mr. Paine has recovered of his illness, and by present Appearances, is in better Health than before. I hope it will not be my Fate to be sick here. Indeed I am not much afraid of these acute Disorders, mine are more chronical, nervous, and slow. -- I must have a Ride. I cannot make it do without it. We are now approaching rapidly to the autumnal Equinox, and no great Blow has yet been struck, in the martial Way, by our Enemies nor by Us. If We should be blessed this Year, with a few Storms as happy as those which fell out last Year, in the Beginning of September, they will do much for Us. The British Fleet, where they now lie, have not an , so convenient, or safe, as they had last Year. Another Winter will do much for Us too. We shall have more and better Soldiers. We shall be better armed. We shall have a greater Force at Sea. We shall have more Trade. Our Artillery will be greatly increased, our Officers will have more Experience, and our Soldiers more Discipline -- our Politicians more Courage and Confidence, and our Enemies less Hopes. Our American  Commonwealths will be all compleatly form'd and organized, and every Thing, I hope, will go on, with greater Vigour. After I had written thus far the Post came in and brought me, your  of the 14 of August . Nabby, by this Time, I conclude is well, and Charles I hope is broke out. Dont you recollect upon this occasion, Dr. Biles's Benediction to me, when I was innoculated? As you will see the Picquancy of it, now more than ever you could before, I will tell the Story. After having been 10 or 11 days , I lay lolling on my Bed, in Major Cunninghams Chamber, under the Tree of Liberty, with half a Dozen young Fellows as lazy as my self, all waiting and wishing for Symptoms and Eruptions. All of a sudden, appeared at the Chamber Door, the reverend Doctor, with his rosy Face, many curled Wigg, and pontifical Air and Gate. I have been thinking, says he, that the Clergy of this Town, ought upon this Occasion, to adopt the Benediction of the Romish Clergy, and, when we enter the Apartments of the sick, to cry, in the foreign Pronunciation ""Pax tecum."" These Words are spoken by foreigners as the Dr. pronounced them Pox take 'em. One would think that Sir Isaac Newton's Discovery of the system of Gravitation did not require a deeper reach of Thought, than this frivolous Pun. Your Plan of making our worthy Brother, Professor, would be very  to me. Your Sentiments of the Importance of Education in Women, are exactly  to my own. Yet the Femmes Scavans, are contemptible Characters. So is that of a Pedant, universally, how much so ever of a male he may be. In reading History you will generally observe, when you light upon a great Character, whether a General, a Statesman, or Philosopher, some female about him either in the Character of a Mother, Wife, or Sister, who has Knowledge and Ambition above the ordinary Level of Women, and that much of his Emminence is owing to her Precepts, Example, or Instigation, in some shape or other. Let me mention an Example or two. Sempronius Gracchus, and Caius Gracchus, two great  unfortunate Men, are said to have been instigated to their great Actions, by their Mother, who, in order to stimulate their Ambition, told them, that she was known in  Rome by the Title of the Mother in Law of Scipio, not the Mother of the Gracchi. Thus she excited their Emulation, and put them upon reviving the old Project of an equal Division of the conquered Lands, (a genuine republican Measure, tho it had been too long neglected to be then practicable,) in order to make their Names as illustrious as Scipios. The great Duke, who first excited the Portuguese to revolt from the Spanish Monarchy, was spurred on, to his great  by a most artfull, and ambitious Wife. And thus indeed you will find it very generally. What Tale have you heard of Gerry? What Mistress is he courting? "
"Philadelphia  August 27. 1776
","Within this half Hour, I received  yours of the 18  by the Post. I have only Time before the Post goes out again to thank you for it, and to express my Resignation to the Will of Heaven whatever it may be respecting my dear . I think his Fate is very uncertain. I will hope the best, but Symptoms so terrible indicate the Utmost danger. Besides he will be more troublesome than the rest, if he recovers, because his exquisite Feelings make him more impatient. You desire me not to forget your ""Herbs."" I am totally at a Loss for your Meaning. Pray explain -- or perhaps your Letter by Mr. Smith, which I have not received, Mr. Smith not being as yet come to Town, will explain it.  "
"Philadelphia  August 28. 1776
","Mr. Benjamin Smith of  S. Carolina, was kind enough to send forward from  New York,  your  of August 14  and it came safely to Hand to day. There is nothing in it, about ""your Herbs,"" which in your Letter of the Eighteenth instant, you wish me to remember. I am yet at a loss for your Meaning. Mr. Gerry carried a Cannister of  India Herb for you, which I hope you received. Pray let me know whether you have or not. Yours of the Eighteenth  has fixed an Arrow in my Heart, which will not be drawn out,  the next Post arrives, and then, perhaps, instead of being withdrawn, it will be driven deeper. My sweet Babe, Charles, is never out of my Thoughts. -- Gracious Heaven preserve him! -- The Symptoms you describe, are so formidable, that I am afraid almost to flatter myself with Hope. -- Why should I repine? Why should I grieve? He is not mine, but conditionally, and subject to the Will of a Superiour, whose Will be done. I shall  with this a Pamphlet, intituled ""The present Method of innoculating for the Small Pox, to which are added, some Experiments instituted with a View to discover the Effects of a similar Treatment, in the natural Small Pox, by Thomas Dinsdale M.D."" This Pamphlet is recommended to me, by Dr. Khun, an eminent Phisician of this City, as containing the best Method, and that which is practised by the greatest Masters in this City. I send this as a Present to you, but you must lend it to Dr. Tufts. I have not Time to read it. Every Moment grows more and more critical at  New York. We expect every Hour, News of serious joy, or Sorrow. The two Armies are very near each other, at  Long Island. "
"Phil.  Aug. 30, 1776
","The two Armies, on  Long Island have been shooting at each other, for this whole Week past, but We have no particular Account of the Advantages gained or Losses suffered, on either side. The General and Officers have been so taken up, with their military Operations, that they have not been able to spare Time to give Us any very particular Information, and the Post which ought to come punctually every day, has been very irregular. I fear We have suffered a good deal. Amidst all my Concern for the Army, my dear  is continually present to my Mind. I dont know what to think. A Load of variolous Matter, sufficient to stupify him for forty Eight Hours, and then to break out so thick, as to threaten a Confluence, I fear will be more than his delicate frame can support. Children of his Age, however, are often seen to bear a great deal. If I had foreseen, that he would have been seized so violently, I should have had no Heart to tell you the vain story of Mather Biles, as I did in  my Letter of the 25th . I have been obliged to hire a servant here, to attend me,  another shall come for me, with my Horses. My Horses I want beyond Measure. I have never been once on Horse back, since I came here, and I suffer, in my Health, for Want of Exercise. Mr. Barrell is thought to be past recovery. After I had written the above, my Servant came in from the Post Office, which he watches very diligently, and brought me  yours of the 22d.  and if you knew how much joy it gave me, your Benevolence would be satisfied. It has given me fine Spirits. I feel quite light. I did not know what fast Hold that little  Charles had upon me before. Give my Love to my little Speckeled Beauty, Nabby. Tell her I am glad she is like to have a few Pitts.  She will not look the worse for them. If she does, she will learn to prize looks less, and Ingenuity more. The best Way to prevent the Pitts from being lasting and conspicuous, is to keep her out of the sun for some time to prevent her from tanning.  and Tom, hardy fellows! I have hardly had occasion to feel at all anxious about them.  is not appointed. Ward is requested to continue. I hope he will. I am much pleased with your Spirit, in resolving to procure me Horses  and not to wait for a Method, which would be more round about and uncertain. -- I think I have a Right and that it is my duty, to take a little Respit and Relaxation. If my Life and Health is of any Use to the Public, it is necessary for the Public as well as for me, that I should take a little rest, in order to preserve them. If they are of none, it is no matter how much rest, I take. "
"Wednesday Septr. 4, 1776","Mr.  arrived Yesterday, and brought me  yours of August 17 . and soon afterwards the Post came in, with  yours of the 25 of Aug.  Am happy to find you, in so good a Way, and am glad to learn that Horses and a Man are coming. I want them much. But our Affairs having taken a Turn at  Long Island and  New York, so much to our Disadvantage, I cannot see my Way clear, to return home so soon as I intended. I shall wait here, untill I see some more decisive Event, in our Favour or against Us. The General Court however will appoint some other Gentleman to relieve me, and my Man and Horses will come, and then I can ride a little in a Morning for my Health, and come home as soon as Circumstances will admit. I am obliged to General Lincoln for his Information, concerning the Fortifications, which I hope will be effectually attended to, as I am not clear, that  Boston is yet secure from Invasion. I hope, the Disasters at  Long Island, and  New York will not dispirit our People. The Ways of Providence are inscrutable. I have strong suspicions that these Disasters have saved  Boston from another Invasion, which I think would have been attempted by the two  Brothers, with their whole Fleet and Army, if they had not obtained  Long Island.

","Mr. Bass arrived this Day, with the  News, that you were all well. By this Opportunity, I shall send you a Cannister of Green Tea, by Mr. Hare. Before Mr.  went away from hence, I asked Mrs. Yard to send a Pound of Green Tea to you. She readily agreed. When I came home  [illegible]   at Night I was told Mr. G. was gone. I asked Mrs. Y. if she had sent the Cannister? She said Yes and that Mr. G. undertook to deliver it, with a great deal of Pleasure. From that Time I flattered my self, you would have the poor Relief of a dish of good Tea under all your Fatigues with the Children, and under all the disagreabble Circumstances attending the small Pox, and I never conceived a single doubt, that you had received it untill Mr. Gerrys Return. I asked him, accidentally, whether he delivered it, and he said Yes to Mr. S.A.'s Lady. -- I was astonished. He misunderstood Mrs. Y. intirely, for upon Inquiry she affirms she told him, it was for Mrs. J.A. I was so vexed at this, that I have ordered another , and Mr. Hare has been kind enough to undertake to deliver it. How the Dispute will be settled I dont know. You must send a Card to Mrs. S.A., and let her know that the Cannister was intended for You, and she may send it you if she chooses, as it was charged to me. It is amazingly dear, nothing less than 40s. lawfull Money, a Pound. I am rejoiced that my Horses are come. I shall now be able to take a ride. But it is uncertain, when I shall set off, for home. I will not go, at present. Affairs are too delicate and critical. -- The Panic may seize whom it will, it shall not seize me. I will stay here, untill the public Countenance is better, or much worse. It must and will be better. I think it is not now bad. Lyes by the Million will be told you. Dont believe any of them. There is no danger of the Communication being cutt off, between the northern and southern Colonies. I can go home, when I please, in spight of all the Fleet and Army of  Great Britain. "
"Fryday Septr. 6, 1776","This day, I think, has been the most remarkable of all. Sullivan came here from Lord Howe, five days ago with a Message that his Lordship desired a half an Hours Conversation with some of the Members of Congress, in their private Capacities. We have spent three or four days in debating whether We should take any Notice of it. I have, to the Utmost of my Abilities during the whole Time, opposed our taking any Notice of it. But at last it was determined by a Majority ""that the Congress being the Representatives of the free and independent states of  America, it was improper to appoint any of their Members to confer, in their private Characters with his Lordship. But they would appoint a Committee of their Body, to wait on him, to know whether he had Power, to treat with Congress upon Terms of Peace and to hear any Propositions, that his Lordship may think proper to make."" When the Committee came to be ballotted for, Dr. Franklin and your humble servant, were unanimously chosen.  R. H. Lee and Mr.  [Edward] Rutledge, had an equal Number: but upon a second Vote Mr. R. was chosen. I requested to be excused, but was desired to consider of it untill tomorrow. My Friends here Advise me to go. All the stanch and intrepid, are very earnest with me to go, and the timid and wavering, if any such there are, agree in the request. So I believe I shall undertake the journey. I doubt whether his Lordship will see Us, but the same Committee will be directed to inquire into the State of the Army, at  New York, so that there will be Business enough, if his Lordship makes none. -- It would fill this  Letter Book, to give you all the Arguments, for and against this Measure, if I had Liberty to attempt it. -- His Lordship seems to have been playing off a Number of Machiavillian Maneuvres, in order to throw upon Us the Odium of continuing this War. Those who have been Advocates for the Appointment of this Committee, are for opposing Maneuvre to Maneuvre, and are confident that the Consequence will be, that the Odium will fall upon him. However this may be, my Lesson is plain, to ask a few Questions, and take his Answers. I can think of but one Reason for their putting me upon this Embassy, and that is this. An Idea has crept into many Minds here that his Lordship is such another as Mr. Hutchinson, and they may possibly think that a Man who has been accustomed to penetrate into the mazy Windings of Hutchinsons Heart, and the serpentine Wiles of his Head, may be tolerably qualified to converse with his Lordship. Yesterdays Post brought me  yours of Aug. 29 . The Report you mention ""that I was poisoned upon my Return at  New York"" I suppose will be thought to be a Prophecy, delivered by the Oracle in mystic Language, and meant that I should be politically or morally poisoned by Lord Howe. But the Prophecy shall be false. "
"Philadelphia  Saturday Septr. 14, 1776
","Yesterday Morning I returned with Dr. F. and Mr. R. from Staten Island where We met  and had about three Hours Conversation with him. The Result of this Interview, will do no disservice to Us. It is now plain that his  [Lordship] has no Power, but what is given him in the Act of  [Parliament]. His Commission authorises him to grant Pardons upon Submission, and to converse, confer, consult and advise with such Persons as he may think proper, upon American Grievances, upon the Instructions to Governors and the Acts of Parliament, and if any Errors should be found to have crept in, his Majesty and the Ministry were willing they should be rectified. I found  yours of 31 of Aug. and  of September   [1776 September 2 is part of the letter dated 31 of Aug. 1776.] . I now congratulate you on your Return home with the Children. Am sorry to find you anxious on Account of idle Reports. -- Dont regard them. I think our Friends are to blame to mention such silly Stories to you. What good do they expect to do by it? My Ride has been of Service to me. We were absent but four days. It was an  Excursion. His  [Lordship] is about fifty Years of Age. He is a well bred Man, but his Address is not so irresistable, as it has been represented. I could name you many Americans, in your own Neighbourhood, whose Art, Address, and Abilities are greatly superiour. His head is rather confused, I think. When I shall return I cant say. I expect now, every day, fresh Hands from Watertown.  "
"Monday Septr. 16, 1776","The Postmaster at  N. York, in a , about a fortnight ago fled to  Dobbs's Ferry, about 30 Miles above  N.Y. upon Hudsons River, which has thrown the Office into disorder, and interrupted the Communication so much that I have not received a Line of yours, since that dated the  Second of September . Nor have I received a News Paper, or any other Letter from  Boston since that date. The same Cause, it is probable has disturbed the Conveyance, to the Eastward, and prevented you from receiving Letters regularly, from me. One of the Horses, which has been sent me, is very low in flesh. I must wait, some time, I fear for him to recruit. No new Delegates come yet. I hope to see some in a few days. We have good News from  France and the  French West Indies . . . . There is great Reason to think they will not always remain inactive. You commanded me to write every Post, and I obey  I have nothing in Particular to say, only that I am as usual, not worse in Health, nor yet well,  but ever Yours.  "
Septr. 21. 1776,"Yours of  9. I have received. Septr. 5. I sent you another Cannister by Mr. Hare. I have only Time to tell you I am not worse in Health than I have been. Where are your new Delegates? None arrived here yet. Our People are as lazy and slothfull, as Congress. "
22 Sept. 1776,"We have at last agreed upon a Plan, for forming a regular Army. We have offered 20 dollars, and 100 Acres of Land to every Man, who will , during the War. And a new sett of Articles of War are agreed on. I will send you, if I can a Copy of these Resolutions and Regulations. I am at a Loss what to write. News We have not. Congress seems to be forgotten by the Armies. We are most unfaithfully served in the Post Office, as well as many other Offices, civil and military.  in public Stations, is deeply criminal. But there is no Encouragement to be faithfull. Neither Profit, nor Honour, nor Applause is acquired by faithfullness. But I know by what. There is too much Corruption, even in this infant Age of our Republic. Virtue is not in Fashion. Vice is not infamous. Since I wrote the foregoing Lines, I have not been able to find Time to write you a Line.  I cannot write you, so often as I wish, you are never out of my Thoughts. I am repining at my hard Lot, in being torn from you, much oftener than I ought. I have often mentioned to you, the Multiplicity of my Engagements, and have been once exposed to the Ridicule and Censure of the World for mentioning the great Importance of the Business which lay upon me, and if this Letter should ever see the Light, it would be again imputed to Vanity, that I mention to you, how busy I am. But I  must repeat it by Way of Apology for not writing you oftener. From four O Clock in the Morning untill ten at Night, I have not a single Moment, which I can call my own. I will not say that I expect to run distracted, to grow melancholly, to drop in an Apoplexy, or fall into a Consumption. But I do say, it is little less than a Miracle, that one or other of these Misfortunes has not befallen me before now. Your  of September 15 ,  20 , and  23d.  are now before me. Every Line from you gives me inexpressible Pleasure. But it is a great Grief to me, that I can write no oftener to you. There is one Thing which excites my utmost Indignation and Contempt, I mean the Brutality, with which People talk to you, of my Death. I beg you would openly affront every Man, Woman or Child, for the future who mentions any such Thing to you, except your Relations, and Friends whose Affections you cannot doubt. I expect it of all my Friends, that they resent, as Affronts to me, every Repetition of such Reports. I shall  to you, Governor Livingstons Speech, the most elegant and masterly, ever made in  America. Depend upon it, the Enemy cannot  off the Communication. I can come home when I will. They have  N. York -- and this is their Ne Plus Ultra. "
Septr. 25. 1776,"I have only Time to say, by Mr. Taylor, that I am not worse than I have been -- that however, I think, the  might have sent somebody here, before now -- and that it will not be many days before I shall sett off. I shall wait for the Completion of a few Things and then go -- perhaps in a Week or ten days. "
Octr. 4. 76,"I send you, all the News. When I do not write I suffer more Pain than you do, when you dont receive a Line. I have no greater Pleasure than in Writing to you, but I have not Time. When I shall come home I dont know. But this you may depend on, I can come when I will. The Communication is open and will remain so. It cannot be  off. The General Court have not appointed any one in my stead. I expected they would -- but whether they do or not I shall come home, before long. "

The first day of October, the day appointed by the Charter of  Pensilvania for the annual Election of Representatives, has passed away, and two Counties only have chosen Members, Bucks and Chester. The Assembly is therefore dead, and the Convention is dissolved. A new Convention is to be chosen, the Beginning of November. The Proceedings of the late Convention are not well liked, by the best of the . -- Their Constitution is reprobated and the Oath with which they have endeavoured to prop it, by obliging every Man to swear that he will not add to, or diminish from or any Way alter that Constitution, before he can vote, is execrated. We live in the Age of political Experiments. Among many that will fail some, I hope will succeed. -- But  Pensilvania will be divided and , and rendered much less vigorous in the Cause, by the wretched Ideas of Government, which prevail, in the Minds of many People in it.  "
Oct. 5. 1776,"Mr. Eliot brought me  yours of  21 , this day. My Health is rather better than worse. The cool Weather, in conjunction with my Ride to  Staten Island, has braced me up, a little, but I shall soon relax again and must have another ride. I sympathize with you, in the Recollection of the  scaenes of the last Year; and I rejoice with you, in the vigorous Health of your excellent Father. I hope his Vigour and Vivacity will be long preserved, for the Benefit of all about him. I long to spend one of our social Evenings with him and the Dr., you Girls sitting by and listening to our profound discourse, as you used to do. I feel a real Sorrow and Affliction at the Loss of my worthy  Field. His deserving Family have sustained a great Loss. Remember me to them, and tell them that I am an hearty Mourner with them. I feel as much for my worthy Brother and sister, as I do for , and for their family as for mine. Both are going to Wreck, but we shall leave them free tho we leave them poor -- And the meanest, poorest American scorns the richest slave, at least I would have it so. I cannot think his scheme of purchasing a Farm will do. -- As to  Colledge I know nothing of it. That Business is misplaced is true. I know more of it, than I have yet thought it prudent to tell the World. I was restrained by dangers of various Kinds, but I will not be always restrained. I will renounce the office of Chief Justice and then I shall be upon equal Ground with other People, and then I will speak and write as freely as my natural Disposition inclines me to do. I have suffered Indignities to , and I have observed without clamouring about Abuses to the Public, when I thought that indulging either public or private Resentment would endanger our Cause -- but I will bear it no longer than the public Cause requires this Patience of me. "
Octr: 7th: 1776,"I have been here,  I am stupified. If I set down to write even to you, I am at a Loss what to write. We expect General Lee, in Town every Hour, He dined at  Wilmington Yesterday. His Appearance at Head Quarters on the Heights of  , would give a flow of Spirits to our Army, there. Some Officer of his Spirit and Experience, seems to be wanted. The Quarter Master Generals Department, the Adjutant Generals Department, and the  Generals Department, have for sometime past, been in great Confusion. The Army have suffered, in their Baggage, Discipline and Health, from those Causes.  "
Oct. 8. 76,"I ought to acknowledge with Gratitude, your constant Kindness in Writing to me, by every Post.  Your  of Septr. 29  came by the last. I wish it had been in my Power, to have returned your Civilities with the same Punctuality, but it has not. Long before this you have received Letters from me, and Newspapers containing a full Account of the . The Communication is still open and the Post Riders now do their Duty and will continue to do so. I assure you, We are as much at a Loss, about Affairs at  New York, as you are. In general, our Generals were out generalled on  Long Island, and Sullivan and Stirling with 1000 Men were made Prisoners, in Consequence of which, and several other unfortunate Circumstances, a Council of War thought it prudent to retreat from that Island, and  Governors Island and then from  New York. They are now posted at   about 10 or 11 Miles from the City. They left behind them some Provisions, some Cannon and some Baggage. Wherever the Men of War have approached, our Militia have most manfully turned their backs and run away, Officers and Men, like sturdy fellows -- and their  have sometimes seized the regular Regiments. One little skirmish on  Montresors Island, ended with the Loss of the brave Major Henley, and the disgrace of the rest of the Party.  Another Skirmish, which might indeed be called an Action, ended in the defeat and shamefull flight of the Enemy, with the Loss of the brave Coll. Knowlton on our Part. The Enemy have Possession of  Paulus Hook and  Bergen Point, Places on the  Jersy side of the North River. By this Time their Force is so divided between  Staten Island,  Long Island,  New York, Paulus Hook and  Bergen Point, that, I think they will do no great Matter more this fall, unless the Expiration of the Term of  of our Army, should disband it. If our new Inlistments fill up, for Soldiers during the War, We shall do well enough. -- Every Body must encourage this. You are told that a Regiment of Yorkers behaved ill, and it may be true, but I can tell you that several Regiments of  Massachusetts Men have behaved ill, too. The Spirit of Venality, you mention, is the most  and alarming Enemy, that  America has to oppose. It is as rapacious and insatiable as the Grave. We are in the Faece Romuli, non Republica Platonis. This predominant Avarice will ruin  America, if she is ever ruined. If God almighty does not interpose by his Grace to controul this universal Idolatry to the Mammon of Unrighteousness, We shall be given up to the Chastisements of his judgments. I am ashamed of the Age I live in. You surprise me with your Account of the Prayers in  for an Abdicated King, a Pretender to the Crown. Nothing of that Kind is heard in this Place, nothing or any other Part of the Continent, but  New York and the Place you mention. This Practice is Treason against the State and cannot be long tolerated. I lament the Loss of Soper, as an honest, and  Member of Society. Dont leave off writing to me -- I write as often as I can. I am glad Master  has an office so usefull to his Mamma and Pappa, as that of Post rider. "
"Philadelphia  Octr. 11, 1776
","I suppose your Ladyship has been in the Twitters, for some Time past, because you have not received a Letter by every Post, as you used to do. -- But I am coming to make my Apology in Person. I, Yesterday asked and obtained Leave of Absence. It will take me till next Monday, to get ready, to finish off a few Remnants of public Business, and to put my private Affairs in proper Order. On the 14th. day of October, I shall get away, perhaps. But I dont expect to reach Home, in less than a fortnight, perhaps not in three Weeks, as I shall be obliged to make stops by the Way. "
"Dedham January 9, 1777","My dear The  Hospitality of Dr. Sprague and his Lady has prevailed upon me, and my worthy Fellow Traveller, to put up at his happy Seat. --We had an agreable Ride to this Place, and tomorrow Morning We sett off, for  Providence, or some other Rout. Present my affection, in the tenderest Manner to my little deserving  and my amiable sons. It was cruel Parting this Morning. My Heart was most deeply affected,, I had the Presence of Mind, to appear composed.  May God almightys Providence protect you, my dear, and all our little ones. My good Genius, my Guardian  whispers me, that We shall see happier Days, and that I shall live to enjoy the Felicities of domestic Life, with her whom my Heart esteems above all earthly Blessings.  "
"Hartford  Jan. 13 1777
","The Riding has been so hard and rough, and the Weather so cold that We have not been able to push farther than this Place. My little Colt has performed very well hitherto, and I think will carry me through the journey, very pleasantly. Our Spirits have been cheered, by two or three Pieces of good News which  who is now with me, tells us, saw Yesterday in a Letter from  [General] Washington, who has gained another considerable Advantage of the Enemy at  Stonny Brook in  the Jersies, as  [General ]Putnam has gained another at  Burlington, and the Jersy Militia a third. The Particulars, you will have before this reaches you in the public Prints. The Communication of Intelligence begins to be more open, and We have no Apprehensions of Danger in the  We shall take. How  has Reason to repent of his Rashness, and will have more. My Love to my dear little ones. They are all very good Children and I have no doubt will continue so. I will drop a Line as often as I can.  "
"Hartford  jany. 14, 1777
","It is now generally believed here that  has killed and taken at least two Thousands of Mr. Howes Army since Christmas. Indeed the Evidence of it is from the Generals own Letters. You know I ever thought Mr. Hows march through  the jerseys a rash Step. It has proved so -- but how much more so would it have been thought if the Americans could all have viewed it in that light and exerted themselves as they might and ought. The whole Flock would infallibly have been taken in the Net. The little Nest of Hornets in  Rhode Island -- is it to remain unmolested this Winter? The  of  N. E. is concerned -- if they are not crushed I will never again glory in being a  N.E. man. There are now  N.E. Generals, Officers and soldiers and if something is not done, any Man may after that call New England men Poltroons with all my Heart.  "
Fish Kill  [17 or 18 January] 1777,"After a March like that of Hannibal over the  Alps We arrived last Night at this Place, Where We found the Utmost Difficulty to get Forage for our Horses, and Lodgings for ourselves, and at last were indebted to the Hospitality of a private Gentleman  Brinkhoff  [Brinckerhoff], who very kindly cared for Us. We came from  Hartford through  Farmington,  Southington,  Waterbury,  Woodbury,New Milford,  New Fairfield,  the Oblong, &c. to  Fish Kill. Of all the Mountains I ever passed these are the worst. -- We found one Advantage however in the Cheapness of Travelling. I dont find one half of the Discontent, nor of the Terror here that I left in the  Massachusetts. People seem sanguine that they shall do something grand this Winter. I am well, and in good Spirits. -- My Horse performs  well. He clambers over Mountains that my old Mare would have stumbled on. The Weather has been dreadfully severe.  "
"Poughkeepsie Jan. 19, 1777","There is too much Ice in  Hudsons River to cross it in Ferry Boats and too little to cross it, without, in most Places, which has given Us the Trouble of riding up the Albany Road as far as this Place, where We expect to go over on the Ice, but if We should be  here, We must go up as far as  Esopus about fifteen miles farther. This, as well as  Fishkill is a pretty Village. We are almost wholly among the Dutch -- Zealous against the Tories, who have not half the Tranquillity here that they have in the Town of  Boston, after all the Noise that has been made about  N. York Tories. We are treated with the Utmost Respect, wherever We go, and have met with nothing like an Insult, from any Person whatever. I heard ten Reflections, and twenty Sighs and Groans, among my Constituents to one here. I shall never have done hoping that my Countrymen will contrive some Coup de main, for the Wretches at  Newport. The Winter is the Time. Our Enemies have divided their Force. Let Us take Advantage of it.  "
"Bethlehem Orange County, State of N. York January 20, 1777
","This Morning We crossed the North River at  Poughkeepsie, on the Ice, after having ridden many Miles on the East side of it to find a proper Place. We landed at  New Marlborough, and passed through that and Newborough  to  New Windsor, where We dined. This Place is nearly opposite to  Fish kill, and but little above the Highlands, where  Fort Constitution and  Fort Montgomery stand. The Highlands are a grand Sight, a range of vast Mountains, which seem to be rolling like a tumbling Sea. -- From  New Windser, We came to this Place, Where We put up, and now We have a free and uninterrupted Passage in a good Road to  Pensilvania. General Washington with his little Army is at  . Cornwallis with his larger one at  Brunswick. Oh that the Continental Army was full. Now is the Time. My little Horse holds out, finely,  We have lost much Time and travelled a great deal of unnecessary Way, to get over the North River. We have Reports of our Peoples taking  Fort Washington again, and taking 400 more Prisoners and six more Pieces of Cannon -- but as I know not the Persons who bring these Accounts I pay no Attention to them.  "
"Easton at the Forks of Delaware River in the State of Pensilvania, Jan. 24, 1777
","We have at last crossed the  Delaware, and are  lodged in  Easton, a little Town, situated on a Point of Land formed by the Delaware on one Side and the  River Lehi, on the other. There is an elegant Stone Church here built by the Dutch People, by whom the Town is chiefly inhabited, and what is remarkable because uncommon, the Lutherans and Calvinists united to build this Church, and the Lutheran and Calvinist Minister, alternately officiate in it. There is also an handsome Court House. The Buildings public and private are all of Lime stone. -- Here are some Dutch Jews. Yesterday We had the Pleasure of seeing the Moravian Mills in  New Jersey. These Mills belong to the Society of Moravians in Bethlehem in  . They are a great Curiosity. The Building is of Limestone four Stories high. It is not in my Power to give a particular Description of this Piece of Mechanism. A vast Quantity of Grain of all sorts  is collected here. We have passed through the famous  County of Sussex in  New Jersey, where the Sussex Court House stands and where We have so often been told the Tories are so numerous and so dangerous. We met with no Molestation, nor Insult. We stopped at some of the most noted Tory Houses, and were treated  with the Utmost Respect. Upon the strictest Inquiry I could make, I was assured that a great Majority of the Inhabitants are stanch Whiggs.Sussex they say can take Care of  Sussex, and yet all agree that there are more Tories in that County  [than in any] other. If the British Army should get into that County in sufficient Numbers to protect the Tories there is no doubt to be made they would be insolent enough and malicious and revengefull. But there is no danger at present and will be none untill that Event takes Place. The Weather has been sometimes bitterly cold, sometimes warm, sometimes rainy and sometimes snowy, and the Roads, abominably hard and rough, so that this journey has been the most tedious I ever attempted. Our Accommodations have been often, very bad, but much better and cheaper than they would have been if We had taken the Road from  Peeks Kill to  Morriston where the Army lies.  "
"Baltimore  Feby. 2, 1777
","Last Evening We arrived safe in this Town after the longest journey, and through the worst Roads and the worst Weather, that I have ever experienced. My Horses performed  well. Baltimore is a very pretty Town, situated on  Petapsco River, which empties itself into the great  Bay of . The Inhabitants are all good Whiggs, having sometime ago banished all the Tories from among them. The Streets are very dirty and miry, but every Thing else is agreable except the monstrous Prices of Things. We cannot get an Horse kept under a Guinea a Week. Our Friends are well. The continental Army is filling up fast, here and in  Virginia. I pray that the Massachusetts may not fail of its Quota, in Season. In this journey, We have crossed four mighty Rivers,  ,  Hudson,Delaware, and  Susquehannah. The two first We crossed upon the Ice, the two last in Boats -- the last We crossed, a little above the Place where it empties into  Cheasapeak Bay. I think I have never been better pleased  with any of our American States than with  Maryland. We saw most excellent  [Farms] all along the Road, and what was  [very] striking to me, I saw more sheep and more flax in  Maryland than I ever saw in riding a like Distance in any other State. We scarce passed a Farm without seeing a fine flock of sheep, and scarce an House without seeing Men or Women, dressing Flax. Several Times We saw Women, breaking and swingling this necessary Article. I have been to Meeting, and heard my old Acquaintance Mr. Allison, a worthy Clergyman of this Town whom I have often seen in  Philadelphia.  "
"Baltimore  Feby. 3, 1777
","This Day has been observed in this Place, with exemplary Decency and Solemnity, in Consequence of an Appointment of the Government, in Observance of a Recommendation of Congress, as a Day of Fasting. I went to the Presbyterian Meeting and heard Mr. Allison deliver a most pathetic and animating, as well as pious, patriotic and elegant Discourse. I have seldom been better pleased or more affected with a sermon. The Presbyterian Meeting House in  Baltimore stands upon an Hill just at the Back of the Town, from whence We have a very fair Prospect of the Town, and of the Water upon which it stands, and of the Country round it. Behind this Eminence, which is the Bacon   Hill of  Baltimore, lies a beautifull Meadow, which is entirely incircled by a Stream of Water. This most beautifull Scaene must be partly natural and partly artificial. Beyond the Meadow and Canall, you have a charming View of the Country. Besides the Meeting House there is upon this Height, a large and elegant Court House, as yet unfinished within, and a small Church of England in which an old Clergyman officiates, Mr. Chase, Father of Mr. Chace one of the Delegates of  Maryland, who they say is not so zealous a Whigg as the Son. I shall take Opportunities to describe this Town and State more particularly to you hereafter. I shall inquire into their Religion, their Laws, their Customs, their Manners, their Descent and Education, their Learning, their Schools and  and their Morals. -- It was said of Ulysses I think that he saw the Manners of many Men and many Cities, which is like to be my Case, as far as American Men and Cities extend, provided Congress should continue in the rolling Humour, which I hope they will not. I wish however, that my Mind was more at rest than it is, that I might be able to make more exact Observations of Men and Things as far as I go. When I reflect upon the Prospect before me of so long an Absence from all that I hold dear in this World, I mean all that contributes to my private personal Happiness, it makes me . When I think on your Circumstances I am more so, and yet I rejoice at them in spight of all this Melancholly. --  God almightys Providence protect and bless you and yours and mine. "
"Baltimore  Feby: 7, 1777
","I am at last after a great deal of Difficulty, settled in comfortable Quarters, but at an infinite  . . . . The Price I pay for my Board is more moderate than any other Gentlemen give, excepting my Colleagues, who are all in the same Quarters, and at the same Rates except Mr. H  [Hancock] who keeps an House by himself. The Prices of Things here, are much more  than at  Boston. The Attempt of  New England to regulate Prices, is  popular in Congress, and who will recommend an Imitation of it to the other States: for my own Part I expect only a partial and a temporary Relief from it. And I fear that after a Time the Evils will break out with greater Violence. The Water will flow with greater Rapidity for having been dammed up for a Time. The only radical Cure will be to stop the Emission of more Paper, and to draw in some that is already out, and devise Means effectually to support the Credit of the Rest. To this End We must begin forthwith to tax the People, as largely as the distressed Circumstances of the Country will bear. We must raise the Interest from four to six Per Cent. We must if possible borrow Silver and Gold from abroad. We must, above all Things,  this Winter, to gain farther Advantages of the Enemy, that our Power may be in somewhat higher Reputation than it is, or rather than it has been.  "
"Baltimore  Feb 7, 1777
","I think, in some Letter I sent you, since I left  Bethlehem, I promised you a more particular Account of that curious and remarkable Town. When We first came in sight of the Town, We found a Country better cultivated and more  diversified with Prospects of orchards and Fields, Groves and Meadows, Hills and Valleys, than any We had seen. When We came into the Town We were directed to a public House kept by a Mr. Johnson, which I think was the best Inn, I ever saw. It belongs it seems to the Society, is furnished, at their , and is kept for their Profit, or at their Loss. Here you might find every Accommodation that you could wish for yourself, your servants and Horses, and at no extravagant Rates neither. The Town is regularly laid out, the Streets straight and at right Angles like those in  Philadelphia. It stands upon an Eminence and has a fine large Brook flowing on one End of it, and   a Branch of  the Delaware on the other. Between the Town and  the Lehigh are beautifull public Gardens. They have carried the mechanical Arts to greater Perfection here than in any Place which I have seen. They have a  of Pumps which go by Water, which force the Water up through leaden Pipes, from the River to the Top of the Hill, near an hundred feet, and to the Top of a little Building, in the shape of a Pyramid, or Obelisk, which stands upon the Top of the Hill and is twenty or thirty feet high. From this Fountain Water is conveyed in Pipes to every Part of the Town. Upon the River they have a fine  of Mills. The best Grist Mills and bolting Mills, that are any where to be found. The best fulling Mills, an oil Mill, a Mill to grind Bark for the Tanyard, a Dying House where all Colours are died, Machines for shearing Cloth &c. There are three public Institutions here of a very remarkable Nature. One, of the young Men, another of the young Women, and a Third of the Widows. There is a large Building, divided into many Appartments, where the young Men reside, by themselves, and carry on their several Trades. They pay a Rent to the Society for their Rooms, and they pay for their Board, and what they earn is their own. There is another large Building, appropriated in the same Manner to the young Women. There is a Governess, a little like the Lady Abbess, in some other Institutions, who has the Superintendence of the whole, and they have elders. Each Apartment has a Number of young Women, who are vastly industrious, some Spinning, some Weaving, others employed in all the most curious Works in , Wool, Cotton, Silver and Gold, Silk and Velvet. This Institution displeased me much. Their Dress was uniform and clean, but very inelegant. Their Rooms were kept extreamly warm with Dutch Stoves: and the Heat, the Want of fresh Air and Exercise, relaxed the poor Girls in such a manner, as must I think destroy their Health. Their Countenances were languid and pale. The Society of Widows is very similar. Industry and Economy are remarkable in all these Institutions. They  Us their Church which is hung round with Pictures of our Saviour from his Birth to his Death, Resurrection and Ascention. It is done with  very strong Colours, and very violent Passions, but not in a very elegant Taste. The Painter who is still living in  Bethelehem, but very old -- he has formerly been in Italy, the school of Paints. They have a very good organ in their Church of their own make. They have a public Building, on Purpose for the Reception of the dead, to which the Corps is carried as soon as it expires, where it lies untill the Time of Sepulture. Christian Love is their professed Object, but it is said they love Money and make their public Institutions subservient to the Gratification of that Passion. They suffer no Law suits with one another, and as few as possible with other Men. It is said that they now profess to be against War. They have a Custom, peculiar, respecting Courtship and Marriage. The Elders pick out Pairs to be coupled together, who have no Opportunity of Conversing together, more than once or twice, before the Knot is tied. The Youth of the two sexes have very little Conversation with one another, before Marriage. , a very agreable, sensible Gentleman, who shewed Us the Curiosities of the Place, told me, upon Inquiry that they profess the Augsburg Confession of Faith, are Lutherans rather than Calvinists, distinguish between Bishops and Presbyters, but have no Idea of the Necessity of the uninterrupted Succession, are very liberal and candid in their Notions in opposition to Bigottry, and live in Charity with all Denominations. "
"Baltimore  Feby. 10, 1777
","Yesterday, I took a long Walk with our Secretary Mr. Thompson to a Place called  Fells Point, a remarkable Piece of Ground about a mile from the Town of Baltimore. It is a Kind of Peninsula which runs out into the , and forms a Bason before the Town. This Bason, within thirty Years, was deep enough for large Tobacco ships to ride in, but since that Time has filled up ten Feet, so that none but small light Vessells can now come in. Between the Town and the Point We pass a Bridge over a small run of Water which empties itself into the Bason, and is the only Stream which runs into it and is quite insufficient to float away the Earth which every year runs into the Bason from the dirty streets of the the Town and the neighbouring Hills and  [illegible]   fields. There are four Men of War just entered   Bay, which makes it difficult for Vessells to go out, and indeed has occasioned an Embargo to be laid here for the present. Your Uncle has two Vessells here, both detained -- one is now employed as a Transport for a little While. These Men of War will disappoint you of your Barrell of flour. Your Uncle's Vessells would sell very well here. Hardens would fetch 800 Pounds of this Money.  "
"Baltimore  Feby. 10, 1777
","Fells Point, which I mentioned in a Letter this Morning, has a considerable Number of Houses upon it. The Shipping all lies now at this Point. You have from it on one side a  View of the Harbour, and on the other a fine Prospect of the Town of  Baltimore. You see the Hill, in full View and the Court House, the Church and Meeting House, upon it. The Court House makes an haughty Appearance, from this Point. There is a Fortification erected, on this Point with a Number of Embrasures for Cannon facing the Narrows which make the Entrance into the Harbour. At the Narrows they have a Fort, with a Garrison in it. It is now a Month and a few days, since I left you. I have heard nothing from you, nor received a Letter from the  Massachusetts. I hope the Post Office will perform better than it has done. I am anxious to hear how you do. I have in my Mind a Source of Anxiety, which I never had before, since I became such a Wanderer. You know what it is. Cant you convey to me, in , which no other Person can comprehend, Information which will relieve me. Tell me you are as well as can be expected. My Duty to your Papa and  my Mamma. Love to Brothers, and Sisters. Tell Betcy I hope She is married. --Tho I want to throw the Stocking. My Respects to Mr. S. [Shaw] Tell him he may be a Calvinist if he will, provided always that he preserves his Candour, Charity and Moderation. What shall I say of or to my  J. C. and T.? What will they say to me for leaving them, their Education and Fortune so much to the Disposal of Chance? -- May almighty and allgracious Providence protect, and bless them. I have this Day sent my Resignation of a certain mighty office. It has relieved me from a Burden, which has a long Time  me. But I am determined, that, while I am ruining my Constitution of Mind and Body, and running dayly Risques of my Life and Fortune in Defence of the Independency of my Country, I will not knowingly resign my own.  "
"Baltimore  Feb. 15, 1777
","Mr. Hall, by whom this Letter will be sent, will carry several Letters to you, which have been written and delivered to him, several Days. He has settled his Business, . I have not received a Line from the Massachusetts, since I left it. Whether We shall return to  Philadelphia, soon, or not, I cannot say. I rather conjecture it will not be long. You may write to me, in Congress, and the Letter will be brought me, wherever I shall be. I am settled now  enough in my Lodgings, there is nothing in this Respect that lies uneasily upon my Mind, except the most extravagant Price which I am obliged to give for every Thing. My Constituents will think me extravagant, but I am not. I wish I could sell or send home my Horses, but I cannot. I must have Horses and a Servant, for Congress will be likely to remove several Times in the Course of the ensuing Year. I am impatient to hear from you, and most tenderly anxious for your Health and Happiness. I am also most affectionately solicitous for my dear  J. C. and T. to whom remember Yours. We long to hear of the Formation of a new Army. We shall loose the most happy opportunity of destroying the Enemy this Spring, if We do not exert ourselves instantly. We have from  New Hampshire a , a Physician by Profession, a Man of Humour. He has a large Budget of droll Stories, with which he entertains Company perpetually. I heard about Twenty or five and twenty Years ago, a Story of a Physician in Londonderry, who accidentally  with one of our  new  England Enthusiasts, call'd  [Exhorters]. The Fanatic soon began to examine the Dr. [concerning] the Articles of his Faith, and what he thought of original Sin? Why, says the Dr., I satisfy myself about it in this manner. Either original Sin is divisible or indivisible. If it was divisible every descendant of Adam and Eve must have a Part, and the share which falls to each Individual at this Day, is so small a Particle, that I think it is not worth considering. If indivisible, then the whole Quantity must have descended in a right Line, and must now be possessed by one Person only, and the Chances are Millions and Millions and Millions to one that that Person is now in  Asia or  Africa, and that I have nothing to do with it. I told  the story and that I suspected him to be the Man. He said he was. He belongs to  Londonderry.  "
"Baltimore  Feb. 17, 1777
","It was this Day determined, to adjourn, tomorrow Week to Philadelphia. How, as you know my opinion always was, will repent his mad march through the Jersies. The People of that Commonwealth, begin to raise their Spirits exceedingly, and to be firmer than ever. They are actuated by Resentment now, and Resentment coinciding with Principle is a very  Motive. I have got into the old Routine of War Office and Congress, which takes up my Time in such a manner that I can scarce write a Line. I have not Time to think, nor to speak. There is an united States Lottery abroad. I believe you had better buy a  and make a Present of it to our four sweet ones, not forgetting the other sweet one. Let us try their Luck. I hope they will be more lucky than their Papa has ever been, or ever will be. I am as well as can be expected. How it happens I dont know nor how long it will last. My Disposition was naturally gay and , but the awful Prospects I have ever had before me, and these  [illegible]  cruel Times will make me melancholly.  I who would not hurt the Hair of the Head of any Animal, I who am always made miserable by the Misery of every sensible being, that comes to my Knowledge, am obliged to hear continual Accounts of the Barbarities, the cruel Murders in cold Blood, even by the most tormenting Ways of starving and freezing, committed by our Enemies, and continual Accounts of the Deaths and Diseases contracted by our People by their own Imprudence. These Accounts harrow me beyond Description. These incarnate Daemons say in great Composure,  Humanity is a Yankey Virtue. -- But that they  [are] governed by Policy."" -- Is there any Policy on this side of Hell, that is inconsistent with Humanity? I have no Idea of it. I know of no Policy, God is my Witness but this -- Piety, Humanity and Honesty are the best Policy. Blasphemy, Cruelty, and  have prevailed and may again. But they wont prevail against America, in this Contest, because I find the more of them are employed the less they succeed.  "

","I shall  with this a Newspaper or two. I am as yet in  Health. My Eyes are somewhat troublesome. I believe I must assume the Appearance of Wisdom, Age and Gravity and put on Spectacles to walk in, about the Streets. I hear nothing from you, nor from any Part of  New England, but I am endeavouring to devise some better Regulations of the Post Office, so that I hope that  of Communication will be opened. We are told that the Air of  Baltimore is unhealthy, and I confess I should dread it, if I were to stay here long. But We shall soon remove. You may write now by the Post. I am very anxious to hear from you, and to know the State of public Affairs, in your Part of the World. I have written by Mr. Hall a Resignation of an Office. I suppose it will make a Noise. But I hope not much. I cant help it. But should be glad to hear from you, how it is received. I hope they  will fill it up soon, that the Talk may be soon over. I could not be, at the same Time in  Maryland and  Massachusetts Bay, which was Reason enough for the Measure, if I had no other, but I have many more, and much stronger. I have not Health enough, and never shall have to discharge such a Trust. I can but just keep myself alive, and in  Spirits when I am master of my own Time and Course of Life. But this is not all. I am not formal and ceremonious enough for such a stiff Situation. -- But you know I have many Reasons more. "
"Baltimore  Feb. 20th, 1777
","This Morning I received  yours of the 26th . Ult. It is the first I have received from you, and except one from  Palmer of the 28th. it is the first I have received from our State. Yours made me very happy. Dont be   uneasy about my Waiter. He behaves very well to me, and he has not the least Appearance of a Spy or a Deserter. He has not Curiosity, nor Activity nor sense enough for such a Character. He does his Duty extreamly well however in his station. But if he was a Spy he would learn nothing from me. He knows no more, from me, than the Horse he rides, nor shall he know . . . . I have no Conversation with him upon Politicks, nor shall he come to the Sight of Papers. I hope our Soldiers for the new Army will be all inoculated at Home before they begin their March. The Small Pox is so thick in the Country that there is no Chance of escaping it in the natural Way.  Washington has been obliged to inoculate his whole Army. We are inocculating soldiers here and at  Philadelphia.  "
"Baltimore  Feb. 21, 1777
","Yesterday, I had the Pleasure of dining with Mr. Purveyance. There are two Gentlemen of this Name in  Baltimore,  and Robert, eminent Merchants, and in Partnership. We had a brillant Company, the two Mrs. Purveyances, the two Mrs. Lees, the Ladies of the two Colonels R. [Richard] H. [Henry] and F. [Francis],Mrs. H. [Hancock] and Miss Katy  [Quincy], and a young Lady that belongs to the Family. If this Letter, like some other wise ones, should be intercepted, I suppose I shall be call'd to Account for not adjusting the Rank of these Ladies a little better. Mr. H., the two  Lees, Coll. Whipple,Mr. Coll. Page,Coll. Ewing, the two Mr. Purveyances, and a young Gentleman. I fancy I have named all the Company. How happy would this Entertainment have been to me if I could by a single Volition have transported one Lady about five hundred miles. But ! this a greater Felicity than falls to my share. We have voted to go to  Philadelphia next Week. We have made General Lincoln a Continental Major General. We shall make  Glover a Brigadier. I sincerely wish We could hear more from General Heath. Many Persons are  dissatisfied with Numbers of the general Officers of the highest Rank. I dont mean the Commander in Chief, his Character is justly very high, but Schuyler,Putnam, Spencer, Heath, are thought by very few to be capable of the great Commands they hold. We hear of none of their heroic Deeds of Arms. I wish they would all resign. For my Part I will vote upon the genuine Principles of a Republic for a new Election of general Officers annually, and every Man shall have my Consent to be left out, who does not give sufficient Proof of his Qualifications. I wish my Lads were old enough. I would send every one of them into the Army, in some Capacity or other. Military Abilities and Experience, are a great Advantage to any Character.  "
"Philadelphia  March 7, 1777
","I am returned in tolerable Health to this Town --  have received but one Letter from you  since I left you, that which you sent by Mr. Rice. If you send Letters to  Warren, or your Unkle Smith, they will be conveyed, with safety. I hope the Post Office will be upon a better footing soon. An Army is gathering in  the jerseys. They have frequent Skirmishes, and the Enemy generally come off second best. -- Whether We shall stay long here is uncertain. If We remove it will not be far. This will go by Dr. Jackson one of the Managers of the Lottery. I hope it will find you all well. I conjecture you have cold Weather and snow enough. We had at  Baltimore last Saturday and Sunday a deep Snow and very sharp frost, such as froze over the Susquehannah, and obliged Us to ride up 15 miles, to cross the River at  Bald fryars. We found a deep snow all the Way to this Place. Maryland and  , have at last compleated their Governments. Mr. Johnson is Governor of the first and Thomas Wharton Jur. of the other. The  Delaware State too have finished theirs. McInlay is Governor. They have also chosen new Delegates to Congress. So have  S. Carolina -- so has . So has  Maryland. There is indeed  a more chearfull Face upon Things than there was. South Carolina is said to have a great Trade and a plenty of Things. Salt comes in frequently and there is a Prospect of supply, though dear. Our national Revenue is now the most delicate and important Object We have to regulate. If this could be put upon a proper footing, We Should be happy. Money comes in fast upon Loan, which is one great Step -- but We must take others. I sent you from  Baltimore, by  Harden, to the Care of your Unkle a Barrell of Burr flour. I hope it will not be taken, but you know I am not lucky in trade. "
"Philadelphia  March 7, 1777
","The President who is just arrived from  Baltimore, came in a few Minutes ago and delivered me,  yours of  8 , which he found at  Susquehannah River, on its way to  Baltimore. It gives me great Pleasure to find that you have received so many: Letters from me,  I knew they contained nothing of importance. I feel a Restraint in Writing like that which you complain of, and am determined to go on trifling. However, the Post now comes regularly, and I believe you may trust it. I am anxious and impatient to hear of the March of the Massachusetts Soldiers for the new Army. They are much wanted. This City is a dull Place, in  of what it was. More than one half the Inhabitants have removed into the Country, as it was their Wisdom to do -- the Remainder are chiefly Quakers as dull as Beetles. From these neither good is to be expected nor Evil to be apprehended. They are a kind of neutral Tribe, or the Race of the insipids. How may possibly attempt this Town, and a Pack of sordid Scoundrels male and female, seem to have prepared their Minds and Bodies, Houses and Cellars for his Reception: but these are few, and more despicable in Character than Number.America will loose nothing, by  gaining this Town. No such Panick will be spread by it, now as was spread by the Expectation of it in December. However, if We can get together Twenty thousand Men by the first of April, will scarcly cross  Delaware River this Year.  New Jersey may yet be his Tomb, where he will have a Monument very different from his Brothers in Westminster Abbey. I am very uneasy that no Attempt is made at  Rhode Island. There is but an  left there, who might be made an easy Prey. The few invalids who are left there are scattered over the whole Island, which is Eleven Miles in length and three or four wide. Are  New England  Men such Sons of Sloth and Fear, as to loose this  [Opportunity?] We may possibly remove again from hence, perhaps to  Lancaster or  Reading. It is good to change Place -- it promotes Health and Spirits. It does good many Ways -- it does good to the Place We remove from as well as to that We remove to -- and it does good to those who move. I long to be at Home, at the Opening Spring, but this is not my Felicity. -- I am tenderly anxious for your Health and for the Welfare of the whole House.  "
"Philadelphia  March 7 1777
","Yours of  12  received this day. I have begged a Bundle of Newspapers, to inclose. They contain some Intelligence. I am pretty well, after all my fatiguing journeys. The  are in as good a Temper as ever I knew them -- more spirited and determined than ever. The Southern  are not full. But are in a good Way. Rejoice to learn that Measures are taking to send along the Eastern Quotas. We are raising a large Body of light Horse --   a large Troop of them are this Moment passing the Window. Fine Horses and good Men. The trampling of these Creatures is grand. , whom I just now saw, assures me that he has bought an excellent Assortment of Medicines and has the best Prospect of putting the Hospitals in good order, so that the sick will not suffer this year as they did last. We have some french  arrived here with Druggs and salt, and other Things. Let me be remembered by all that I remember. You know who they are. "
"Philadelphia  March 14, 1777
","Congress has been sitting several Days and proceeding upon Business. I have been in Town above a Week and have spent much of my Time, in making Inquiries after the cheapest Places in Town for Board and stabling. I have at last removed my Horses from a stable at six and six Pence a Night, to another at three dollars a Week each. So that for the future I am to pay only six dollars a Week for Hay and, oats for my Horses. Oats they must have here, for the Hay is such as, our Horses cannot live upon, nor indeed their own. I am this day to remove my Quarters, from three Pounds a Week for myself and thirty shillings for my servant, to another Place where they vouchsafe to keep me for forty seven and six Pence, and my servant for twenty shillings. I shall then live at the cheapest Lay. Cheap indeed! What will become of you, I know not. How you will be able to live past my Comprehension, but I hope the Regulation of Prices, will be of Service to you. I dont know whether I have mentioned to you in any former Letter, that I sent you a Barrell of burr flour from  Baltimore, by  Harden, in your Uncles Vessell. I hope she is not taken. I wish to hear often from you. Believe the Post may be now trusted. Believe me to be more yours, and more anxious for your Welfare than any Words can express. The Government of   is taking Root downwards, and bearing Fruit upwards, notwithstanding the Squibbs in the News Papers. They are making Treason Laws and Militia Laws, &c. The  Government is making a Militia Law too. The People of that State will be all soldiers. They are exasperated, to a great degree, at the Treatment they have received, and are panting for Revenge. The Quakers too are inflamed with Resentment. They say, that they were used worse, than any other People. In a Time of , and especially a War like this, one may see the Necessity and Utility, of the divine Prohibitions of Revenge, and the Injunctions of forgiveness of Injuries and love of Enemies, which We And in the Christian Religion. Unrestrained, in some degree by these benevolent Laws, Men would be Devils, at such a Time as this. Prattle for me to my little Friends. Give them my best Wishes, Blessings and Prayers. "

","The Spring advances, very rapidly, and all Nature will soon be  in her gayest Robes. The green Grass, which begins to shew itself, here, and there, revives in my longing Imagination my little Farm, and its dear Inhabitants. What Pleasures has not this vile War deprived me of? I want to wander, in my Meadows, to ramble over my Mountains, and to sit in Solitude, or with her who has all my Heart, by the side of the Brooks. These beautifull Scaenes would contribute more to my Happiness, than the sublime ones which surround me. I begin to suspect that I have not much of the Grand in my Composition.  The Pride and Pomp of War, the continual Sound of Drums and Fifes as well played, as any in the World, the Prancings and Tramplings of the Light Horse numbers of whom are paraded in the Streets every day, have no Charms for me. I long for rural sceanes and domestic scaenes, for the warbling of Birds and the Prattle of my Children. Dont you think I am somewhat poetical this morning, for one of my Years, and considering the Gravity, and Insipidity of my Employment. -- As much as I converse with Sages and Heroes, they have very little of my Love or Admiration. I should prefer the Delights of a Garden to the Dominion of a World. I have nothing of Caesars Greatness in my soul. Power has not my Wishes in her Train. The Gods, by granting me Health, and Peace and Competence, the Society of my Family and Friends, the Perusal of my Books, and the Enjoyment of my Farm and Garden, would make me as happy as my Nature and State will bear. Of that Ambition which has Power for its Object, I dont believe I have a Spark in my Heart . . . There there  other Kinds of Ambition of which I have a great deal. I am now situated, in a pleasant Part of the Town, in  Street, in the south side of it, between second and third Streets, at the House of Mr. Duncan, a Gentleman from  Boston, who has a Wife and three Children. It is an agreable Family. General Wolcott of  Connecticutt, and Coll. Whipple of  Portsmouth, are with me in the same House. Mr. Adams has removed to Mrs. Cheasmans  [Cheesman's], in fourth Street near the Corner of Markett Street, where he has a curious Group of Company consisting of Characters as opposite, as North and South. Ingersol, the Stamp man and judge of Admiralty, Sherman, an old Puritan, as honest as an Angell and as stanch as a blood Hound firm as a Rock in the Cause of American Independence, as Mount Atlass, and Coll. Thornton, as droll and funny as Tristram Shandy. Between the Fun of Thornton, the Gravity of Sherman, and the formal Toryism of Ingersol, Adams will have a curious Life of it. The Landlady too who has buried four Husbands, one Tailor, two shoemakers and Gilbert Tenant  [Tennent], and still is ready for a fifth, and well deserves him too, will add to the Entertainment. -- Gerry and Lovell are yet at Miss Leonards, under the Auspices of Mrs. Yard. Mr. Hancock has taken an House in  Street, near the Corner of fourth Street near the State House. We this day received Letters from Dr. Franklin and . I am not at Liberty to mention particulars. But in general the Intelligence is very agreable. I am now convinced, there will be a general War. "
"Philadelphia  March 22. 1777
","The Post now comes regularly, once a Week, and brings me the  Boston News Papers, but no Letters from  Penns Hill or its Environs. How do you do? Anxious, faint, ? Chear up -- dont be distressed. We shall see many good days yet, I hope. I derive a secret Pleasure from a Circumstance which I suppose at present occasions the most of your Apprehensions. I wish I could know more particularly, concerning your Health, but I will presume it to be, as well as can be expected. The little Folk are all happy I hope. May they continue so, to a good old Age. May they enjoy many happy,  and honourable Days. "

The Barber means, that a Villain was taken up, and examined Yesterday, who appears by his own Confession to have been employd by Lord Howe and Jo. Galloway to procure Pilots to conduct the Fleet up  Delaware River and through the  Chevaux de Frizes. His Confidant is a Woman, who is said to be kept by a Jew.

","I know not the Time, when I have omitted to write you, so long. I have received but three Letters from you, since We parted, and these were short ones. Do you write by the Post? If you do there must have been some Legerdemain. The Post comes now constantly once a Week, and brings me News Papers, but no Letters. I have ventured to write by the Post, but whether my Letters are received or not, I dont know. If you distrust the Post, the Speaker or your  Smith will find frequent Opportunities of conveying Letters. I never was more desirous of hearing frequently from Home, and never before heard so seldom. We have Reports here, not very  to the Town of  Boston. It is said that Dissipation prevails and that Toryism abounds, and is openly avowed at the Coffee Houses. I hope the Reports are false. Apostacies in  Boston are more abominable than in any other Place. Toryism finds worse Quarter here. A poor fellow, detected here as a Spy, employed as he confesses by Lord Howe and Mr. Galloway to procure Pilots for  Delaware River, and for other Purposes, [illegible]   was this day at Noon, executed on the Gallows in the Presence of an immense Crowd of Spectators. His Name was James Molesworth. He has been Mayors Clerk to three or four Mayors. I believe you will think my Letters, very trifling. Indeed they are. I write in . Accidents have thrown so many Letters into the Hands of the Enemy, and they take such a malicious Pleasure, in exposing them, that I choose they should have nothing but Trifles from me to expose. For this Reason I never write any Thing of Consequence from  Europe, from  Philadelphia, from Camp, or any where else. If I could write freely I would lay open to you, the whole system of Politicks and War, and would delineate all the Characters in Either Drama, as minutely,altho I could not do it, so elegantly, as Tully did in his Letters to Atticus. We have Letters however from  France by a  in at  Portsmouth -- of her important Cargo you have heard. There is News of very great Importance in the Letters, but I am not at Liberty. The News, however, is very agreeable. "
April 2 1777,"Yesterdays Post brought me  your kind  of March 8. 9. 10,  with a Letter inclosed for  [from] each of my Sons. But where is my Daughters Letter? That is missing. I regret the Loss of it much. You think I dont write  enough! Indeed I have a surfeit of them. But I shall give you now and then a Taste, since you have such a Goust for them. By a Letter of 17.  Dr. Franklin, Mr. Deane and Dr. Lee, met in  Paris, and on 28. december had an Audience of the Count de Vergennes, Secretary of State and Minister of foreign Affairs; laid before him their Commission, with the Articles of the proposed Treaty of Commerce; were assured of the Protection of his Court, and that due Consideration should be given to what they offered. Soon after they presented a Memorial on the Situation of our States, drawn up at the Ministers Request, together with the Articles of general Confederation, and the Demand for ships of War,agreable to their Instructions. Copies of all which Papers, they gave to the Count D'Aranda, the Spanish Ambassador, to be communicated to his Court. They were promised an Answer from the french Court, as soon as they could know the Determination of  Spain, with whom they design to Act with perfect Unanimity. In the mean Time they are expediting several Vessels laden with Artillery, Arms, Ammunition and . The Ports of  France,  Spain and  Florence (that is Leghorne in the Mediterranean) are open to the American , upon the usual Terms of Neutrality. They write for Commissions to be given to Privateers, and for more frequent and authentic Intelligence. Great Efforts are now making by the British Ministry, to procure more Troops from  Germany. The Princes in Alliance with  France, have refused to lend any, or to enter into any  of Hanover, which  England has been mean enough to ask, being apprehensive for that Electorate if she should draw from it, any more of its Troops. Four more Regiments (two of them to be light Horse) are raising in Hesse, where there has been an Insurrection, on Account of drafting the People: and now great sums of Money, are distributed for procuring Men. They talk of Ten thousand Men in all to be sent over this Spring. The Hearts of the French are universally for Us, and the Cry is strong for immediate War with  Britain. Indeed  tends that Way, but the Court has Reasons for postponing it, a little longer. In the mean Time, Preparations are making. They have Twenty six sail of the Line manned and fit for the Sea. Spain has seventeen sail in the same State, and more are fitting with such Diligence, that they reckon to have thirty sail in each Kingdom, by April. This must have an immediate good Effect in our Favour, as it keeps the English Fleet at Bay, coops up their Seamen, of whom they will scarce find sufficient to man their next set of Transports, will probably keep Lord Howes fleet more together for fear of a Visit, and leave Us more Sea room, to prey upon their Commerce and a freer Coast to bring in our Prizes, and supplies from abroad. The Letter then mentions a Circumstance much to our Advantage but this is a secret. So strong is the Inclination of the Wealthy, in  France to assist Us, that our Ambassadors have been offered a Loan of two Millions of Livres, without Interest, and to be repaid when the   are settled in Peace and Prosperity. No Conditions or securities are required. They have accepted this noble Benefaction, and one half of it is paid into the Hands of their Banker. On the strength of this supply, they are now in Treaty for some strong ships. Lee is in  N.Y. confined, but otherwise treated well. "
"Philadelphia  April 3. 1777
","As you seem so inquisitive about , I will indulge you so far (indulge, I say, observe that Word indulge! I suppose you will say it ought to have been oblige) as to send you a little more News from abroad. As foreign Affairs are now become more interesting to Us than ever, I dare say your political Curiosity has extended itself e'er this all over Europe. The Agent of the King of Prussia, has often made Proposals of a commercial Nature, to our Agents in  France, and expressed a Desire that some American would go to  Berlin, at the Instance of his sovereign, who wishes to have a clear Idea of the Nature of our Commerce. You must know, that this Prince has been several Years, dreaming of making his  Port of Embden, an  Amsterdam. We cannot as yet, depend that the Dutch Merchants will venture to trade directly to  America, at their own . The States however have declared, in Answer to a fresh Remonstrance of General York, that their Ports are open to all Nations, and that their Trade, to and from their own Colonies, shall be unmolested, their subjects complying with the ordinances issued by their high Mightynesses. Their Prohibition of exporting Warlike stores extends to all British subjects. Without a very material and apparent success of the British Arms in  America, a Loan would be very slowly negotiated for  England in  Amsterdam. Nothing hinders them now from selling out of the English Funds, but their not knowing what to do with their Money. For that Country may be called the Treasury of Europe, and its Stock of Specie is more or less, according to the Necessities of the different Princes in  Europe. The Credit of  France has been very low of late. The Mismanagement of the Finances in the late Kings Reign: The Character of the late Comptroller General, Mr. De Olugny, had reduced it so low, that it was impossible to borrow  considerable, on perpetual Funds. By Life Rents, something might be done. Perhaps a Financier, in whose Probity the World have a Confidence, may restore their Credit. The French Stocks rise on the Appointment of Mr. Taboureau. That it is possible for  France to borrow, is certain, for at the Time when Mr. Turgot was removed, he was negotiating a Loan, and was likely to succeed, for Sixty Millions of Guilders. The Credit of  Spain is extreamly good: That Kingdom may have what Money it will, and on the best Terms. The Emperors Credit is also good, not as Emperor but from his hereditary Dominions.  Sweeden and  Denmark have good Credit. The first the best. They have Money at four Per Cent. and it is not long since the King of Sweeden borrowed Three Millions of Guilders, at that Interest, to pay off old debts at five Per Cent. -- his Interest is paid punctually.  Prussia has no Credit but his Treasury is full, by squeezing the last Farthing from his People, and now and then he draws a little Money from Holland, by reviving obsolete Claims. The Credit of the Empress of  Russia, is very good, for she has punctually paid the Interest of Twelve Millions of Guilders, which she borrowed in her War with the Turks, and has lately paid off, one Million and an half of the Principal. These are the strongest Recommendations to a mercantile People. As to  America, in the present state of Affairs, it is not probable, that a Loan is practicable, but should it appear evident, that We are likely to support our Independency, or should either  France or  Spain acknowledge it: in either of these Cases We might have Money. And when it shall be seen that We are punctual in our first Payments of the Interest, We should have as much as We pleased. "
"Philadelphia  April 6, 1777
","You have had many , propagated among you, which I suppose you know not how to account for. One was, that Congress, the last Summer, had tied the Hands of General Washington, and would not let him fight, particularly on the  White Plains. This Report was totally groundless. -- Another was, that at last Congress untied the General, and then he instantly fought and conquered at  Trenton. This also was without foundation, for as his Hands were never tied, so they were. not untied. -- Indeed, within a few days past a Question has been asked Congress, to the Surprize I believe of every Member there, whether the General was bound by the Advice of a Council of War? No Member of Congress, that I know of ever harboured or conceived such a Thought. ""Taking the Advice of a Council of War"" are the Words of the Generals Instructions, but this meant only that Councils of War, should be called and their Opinions and Reasons demanded, but the General like all other Commanders of Armies, was to pursue his own judgment after all. Another Report, which has been industriously circulated, is, that the General has been made by Congress, Dictator. But this is as false as the other Stories. Congress it is true, upon removing to  Baltimore, gave the General Power, to raise fifteen , in Addition to those which were ordered to be raised before, and to appoint the Officers, and also to raise three thousand Horse, and to appoint their Officers, and also to take Necessaries for his Army, at an appraised Value. But no more. Congress never thought of making him Dictator, or giving him a Sovereignty.  I wish I could find a Correspondent, who was idle enough to attend to every Report and write it to me. Such false News, uncontradicted, does more or less Harm. Such a Collection of , would be a Curiosity for Posterity. The Report you mentioned in your last, that the British Administration had proposed to Congress, a Treaty and Terms, is false and without a . On the Contrary, it is now more than ever past a doubt, that their fixed Determination is Conquest, and unconditional Subjugation. But there will be many Words and Blows too, before they will accomplish their Wishes. -- Poor abandoned, infatuated Nation. Infatuation is one of the Causes to which, great Historians ascribe many Events: and if it ever produced any Effect, it has produced this War, against America. Arnold, who carries this, was taken in his Passage from  Baltimore. He sailed with Harden, for  Boston. They took 15 , while he was on Board the Man of War. Your Flour was highly favoured with good Luck. "
"Philadelphia  April 6. 1777
","This Evening Major Ward  me  Yours of 23d. of March .-- It is a great Pleasure to me to learn that your Flour has arrived. I begin to have some opinion of my good Fortune. If I could have been certain, of the Vessells escaping the many Snares in her Way, I would have sent a dozen Barrells. The Act, my dear, that you were so fond of will do no good. Legislatures cannot effect Impossibilities. I detest all Embargoes, and all other Restraints upon Trade. Let it have its own Way, in such a Time as this and it will cure its own Diseases. The Paper emitted by the states jointly and separately is too much, it is more than enough to purchase every Commodity and every Species of  that is wanted, and this Excess of Quantity is the true Cause of the Artificial Scarcity of Things, but the Price of this will be in Proportion to the Demand, in spite of all Regulations. -- To save my self the Trouble of thinking I will transcribe for your Amusement a few observations of Lord Kaims, on the subject of Money, Scarcity, Plenty, and Demand. Read them, compare them with the Increase of Money in  America, the Decrease of Goods and Labour, and the Increase of Demand for both, and then judge whether the Regulations and Embargoes can do any good ....        "
Ap. 8. 1777,"Yours of 26 March  came by this days Post. Am happy to hear you have received so many Letters from me. You need not fear Writing in your cautious Way by the Post, which is now well regulated. But if your Letters should be intercepted, they would do no Harm. The F. turns out to be the Man, that I have seen him to be, these two Years. He is in total Neglect and Disgrace here. I am sorry for it, because of the forward Part he took, in the Beginning of the Controversy. But there is certainly such a Thing as falling away, in Politicks, if there is none in Grace. Lee fares as well as a Man in close Prison, can fare, I suppose, constantly guarded and watched. I fancy, Howe will engage that he shall be treated as a Prisoner of War, and in that Case, We shall all be easy. For my own Part, I dont think the Cause depends upon him. I am sorry to see such wild  in your Newspapers. I wish they would consider the Woes against Idolatry. Congress is now full. Every one of the thirteen States has a Representation in it, which has not happened before a long Time. Maryland has taken a Step which will soon  their Quota. They have made it lawfull for their Officers, to inlist servants and Apprentices. The fine new Frigate, called the Delaware,  Alexander, has sailed down the River. I stood upon the Wharf to see the fine figure and Show she made. They are fitting away the Washington,Captn. Reed  [Read], with all possible dispatch. We have at last finished the System of Officers for the Hospitals, which will be printed Tomorrow. As soon as it is done, I will  it to you. A most ample, generous, liberal Provision it is. The Expence will be great. But Humanity overcame Avarice. "
"Sunday April 13, 1777","Enclosed with this you have a Correspondence, between the two Generals, concerning the Cartell for the Exchange of Prisoners.  is in the Right, and has maintained his Argument with a Delicacy, and a Dignity, which do him much Honour. He has hinted, at the flagitious Conduct of , towards their Prisoners, in so plain and clear a manner, that he cannot be misunderstood; but yet a decency and a Delicacy is preserved which is the more to be applauded, because the natural Resentment of such Atrocious Cruelties renders it very difficult to avoid a more pointed Language, in describing them. They might indeed, without much Impropriety, have been painted in crimson Colours of a deeper Die. If  Heart is not callous, what must be his Feelings, when he recollects the Starvings, the Freezings, the pestilential Diseases, with which, he coolly and deliberately destroyed the Lives of so many, unhappy Men. If his Conscience is not seared, how will he bear its Lashes when he remembers his Breach of Honour, his Breach of Faith, his offence against Humanity, and Divinity, his Neighbour and his God, if he thinks there is any such Supream Being, in impairing Health that he ought to have cherished, and in putting an End to Lives that he ought to have preserved, and in choosing the most slow, lingering and torturing Death, that he could have devised? I charitably suppose, however, that he would have chosen the shortest Course and would have put every Man, to the Sword or Bayonett,  and thereby have put an End to their Sufferings, at once, if he could have done it without Detection. But this would have been easily proved upon him, both by his Friends and Enemies. Whereas, by Starving Hunger, Frost and Disease, he might commit the Murders, with equal Certainty, and yet be able to deny that he had done it. He might lay it to Hurry, to Confusion, to the fault of Commissaries and other Officers. Nay might deny, that they were starved, frozen and infected. He was determined to put them out of the Way, and yet to deny it, to get rid of his Enemies, and yet save his Reputation. -- But his Reputation is ruined forever. The two Brothers will be ranked by Posterity with Pizarro, with Borgia, with Alva, and with others in the Annals of Infamy, whose Memories are  to the Hisses and Execrations of all virtuous Men. These two unprincipled Men are the more detestable, because they were in the opposition at home, their Connections, Friendships and Interest lay with the opposition, to the opposition they owed their Rise, Promotion and Importance. Yet they have basely deserted their Friends and Party, and have made themselves the servile Tools of the worst of Men in the Worst of Causes. But what will not desperate Circumstances tempt Men to do, who are without Principle? and who have a strong aspiring Ambition, a towering Pride, and a tormenting Avarice. These two Howes were very poor, and they have spent the little Fortunes they had in bribery at Elections, and having obtained Seats in Parliament, and having some Reputation as brave Men, they had nothing to do but to carry their Votes and their  to Markett, and it is very true, they have sold them at an high Price. Are Titles of , the Reward of Infamy? Is Gold a Compensation for Vice? Can the one or the other, give that Pleasure to the Heart, that Comfort to the Mind, which it derives from doing Good? from a Consciousness of Acting, upon upright and generous Principles, of promoting the Cause of Right, Freedom and the Happiness of Men. Can Wealth or Titles, soften the Pains of the Mind upon reflecting that a Man has done Evil, and endeavoured to do Evil to Millions, that he has destroyed free Governments and established Tyrannies! I would not be an , for all the Empires of the Earth, and all the Riches, and Glories thereof. Who would not rather be brave, even  unfortunate, in the Cause of Liberty? Who would not rather be Sydney, than Monk? However, if I am not deceived, Misfortune as well as Infamy awaits these Men. They are doomed to defeat, and Destruction. It may take Time to effect it, but it will certainly come.  America is universally convinced of the Necessity of meeting them in the Field in firm  -- and American Fire is terrible. "
"April 13, 1777","I have spent an Hour, this Morning, in the Congregation of the dead. I took a Walk into the Potters Field, a burying Ground between the new stone Prison, and the Hospital, and I never in my whole Life was affected with so much . The Graves of the soldiers, who have been buryed, in this Ground, from the Hospital and bettering House, during the Course of the last Summer, Fall, and Winter, dead of the small Pox, and Camp Diseases, are enough to make the Heart of stone to melt away. The Sexton told me, that upwards of two Thousand soldiers had been buried there, and by the Appearance, of the Graves, and Trenches, it is most probable to me, he speaks within Bounds. To what Causes this Plague is to be attributed I dont know. It seems to me, that the Want of Tents, , soap, Vegetables,Vinegar, Vaults &c. cannot account for it all. Oatmeal and Peas, are a great Preservative of our Enemies. Our Frying Pans and Gridirons, slay more than the Sword. Discipline, Discipline is the great Thing wanted. There can be no order, nor Cleanliness, in an Army without Discipline. We have at last, determined on a Plan for the Sick, and have called into the Service the best Abilities in  and Chirurgery, that the Continent affords. I pray God it may have its desired Effect, and that the Lives and Health of the Soldiers may be saved by it. Disease has destroyed Ten Men for Us, where the Sword of the Enemy has killed one. Upon my Return from my pensive  Walk, I heard a Piece of disagreable News-That the ship Morris, Captain Anderson from Nantz, with Cannon, Arms, Gunlocks, Powder &c. was chased into Delaware Bay by two or three Men of War -- that she defended herself manfully against their Boats and Barges, but finding no Possibility of getting clear, she run aground. The Crew, and two French Gentlemen Passengers got on shore, but the Captain, determined to disappoint his Enemy in Part, laid a Train and blew up the ship, and lost his own Life unfortunately in the Explosion. I regret the Loss of so brave a Man much more than that of the ship and Cargo. The People are fishing in order to save what they can, and I hope they will save the Cannon. The French Gentlemen, it is said have brought Dispatches from France to the Congress. I hope this is true. If it is, I will let you know the Substance of it, if I may be permitted to disclose it. "
"Philadelphia  Ap. 16, 1777
","We are waiting with some Impatience to hear of the Arrival of some of the Massachusetts Troops at Head Q--rs . The Lassitude and Torpor, that has seized  our New Englandmen, is to me, very surprizing. Something will happen I believe, to  them from their Lethargy. If they dont go and crush that little Nest of Hornetts at  Newport, I shall think them dead to all Sense of Honour, Virtue, Shame, and Love to their Country. The continental Troops must all march to  Fishkill and  Ti  . . . . These are the Places to stop the Progress of the Enemy into  New England, which I believe is their Intention, notwithstanding all that they give out about coming to  Philadelphia. If they come here, they shall get little but bare Walls. And here they will be starved and drubbed. "
"Ap. 19, 1777","We have now an ample Representation from  N. York. It consists of Six Delegates, and they are to all Appearance, as high, as decisive, and as determined, as any Men ever were, or can be. There is a new Hand, a Mr. Duer, who is a very fine fellow -- a Man of sense, Spirit and Activity, and is exceeded by no Man in Zeal. Mr. Duane and Mr. Phillip Livingston, are apparently, as determined as any Men in Congress. You will see by the  Newspaper, that Duane  and Jay have arrived at the Honour of being ranked, with the Two Adams's. I hope they will be duely sensible, of the illustrious Distinction, and be sure to behave in a manner becoming it. This is the Anniversary of the ever memorable 19. April 1775 -- Two  Years We have maintained open War, with Great Britain and her Allies, and after all our Difficulties and Misfortunes, are much abler to cope with them now than We were at the Beginning.

You seem to be in fine Spirits -- I rejoice at it.  has commanded in  Philadelphia, until about a Fortnight ago, he went to  Ticonderoga, where he is to command all Summer. Schuyler is here, where he now commands. We are  along Soldiers to the General, as fast as they get well of Inocculation. I think our N. Englandmen have been rather tardy, but I hope soon to hear of the Arrival of their Men at  Morristown. The Army there, and at  Ticonderoga too, is too weak. But Howes Army is weak too. Let the Tories, and Cowardly , exagerate, as much as they will, How has not in all America, Ten Thousand Men fit for Duty, nor in my Opinion Seven. "
"Ap. 23, 77","My Barber has just left the Chamber. The following curious Dialogue was the Amusement, during the gay Moments of Shaving. Well, Burn, what is the Lye of the day? -- Sir, Mr.  just told me, that a Privateer from  Baltimore, has taken two valuable Prizes, with Sixteen Guns each. I can scarcely believe it. -- Have you heard of the Success of the Rattlesnake of  Philadelphia, and the Sturdy Beggar of  Maryland, Mr. Burn? These two Privateers have taken Eleven Prizes, and sent them into the  West India Islands, Nine Transports and two Guinea Men. -- Confound the ill Luck, sir, I was going to sea myself on board the Rattlesnake and my Wife fell a yelping. These Wives are queer Things. I told her I wondered she had no more Ambition. Now, says I, when you walk the Street, and any Body asks who that is? The Answer is ""Burn the Barbers Wife."" Should you not be better pleased to hear it said ""That is Captain Burns Lady, the Captain of Marines on board the Rattlesnake""? Oh! says she, I had rather be called Burn the Barbers Wife, than Captain Burns Widow. I dont desire to live better, than you maintain me, my dear. So it is, Sir, by this sweet, honey Language I am choused out of my Prizes, and must go on, with my Soap and Razors and Pinchers and Combs. I wish she had more Ambition. --  If this Letter should be intercepted by the Tories, they will get a Booty. -- Let them enjoy it. If some of their Wives had been as tender and discreet, as the Barbers, their Husbands Ambition would not have led them into so many Salt Ponds . . . What an Ignis fatuus this Ambition is! How few of either Sex, have arrived at Mrs. Burns pitch of Moderation, and are able to say, I dont desire to live better: and had rather be the Barbers Wife than the Captains Widow. -- Quite smart I think as well as Philosophical. "
Saturday Evening 26 April 1777,"I have been lately more remiss, than usual in Writing to you. There has been a great Dearth of News. Nothing from  England, nothing from  France,  Spain, or any other Part of  Europe, nothing from the  West Indies. Nothing from Howe, and his Banditti, nothing from General Washington. There are various Conjectures that  is dead, sick, or gone to England, as the Proclamations run in the Name of Will. Howe only, and nobody from  New York can tell any Thing of his Lordship. I am wearied out, with Expectations that the Massachusetts Troops would have arrived,  now, at Head Quarters. -- Do our People intend to leave the Continent in the Lurch? Do they mean to submit? or what Fatality attends them? With the noblest Prize in View, that ever Mortals contended for, and with the fairest Prospect of obtaining it upon easy Terms, The People of the  Massachusetts Bay, are dead. Does our State intend to send only half, or a third of their Quota? Do they wish to see another, crippled, disastrous and  Campaign for Want of an Army? -- I am more sick and more ashamed of my own Countrymen, than ever I was before. The Spleen, the Vapours, the Dismals, the Horrors, seem to have seized our whole State. More Wrath than Terror, has seized me. I am very mad. The gloomy Cowardice of the Times, is  in  N. England. Indeed I feel not a little out of , from Indisposition of Body. You know, I cannot pass a Spring, or fall, without an ill Turn -- and I have had one these four or five Weeks -- a Cold, as usual. Warm Weather, and a little Exercise, with a little Medicine, I suppose will cure me as usual. I am not confined, but moap about and drudge as usual, like a Gally Slave. I am a Fool if ever there was one to be such a Slave. I wont be much longer. I will be more free, in some World or other. Is it not , that the opening Spring, which I should enjoy with my Wife and Children upon my little Farm, should pass away, and laugh at me, for labouring, Day after Day, and Month after Month, in a Conclave, Where neither Taste, nor Fancy, nor Reason, nor Passion, nor Appetite can be gratified? Posterity! You will never know, how much it cost the present Generation, to preserve your Freedom! I hope you will make a good Use of it. If you do not, I shall repent in Heaven, that I ever took half the Pains to preserve it. "
"Ap. 27, 1777","Your  of Ap. 2  and  Ap. 7 . I have received. The  Evening Post, will give you, some Idea, of the Humanity of the present Race of Brittons. -- My Barber, whom I quote as often as ever I did any Authority, says  ""he has read Histories of Cruelty; and he has read Romances of Cruelty: But the Cruelty of the British exceeds all that he ever read."" For my own Part, I think We cannot dwell too much, on this Part of their Character, and Conduct. It is full of important Lessons. If the Facts only were known, in the Utmost Simplicity of Narration, they would strike every pious, and humane Bosom, in  Great Britain with Horror .... Every Conscience in that Country is not callous nor every Heart hardened. The plainest Relation of Facts, would interest the Sympathy, and Compassion of all  Europe in our . And it would convince every American that a Nation, so great a Part of which is thus deeply depraved, can never be again trusted with Power over Us. I think that not only History should perform her Office, but Painting, Sculpture, Statuary,  and Poetry ought to assist in publishing to the World, and perpetuating to Posterity, the horrid deeds of our Enemies. It will shew the Persecution, We suffer, in defence of our Rights -- it will shew the Fortitude, Patience, Perseverance and Magnanimity of Americans, in as strong a Light, as the Barbarity and Impiety of Britons, in this persecuting War. Surely, Impiety consists, in destroying with such hellish Barbarity, the rational Works of the Deity, as much as in blaspheming and defying his Majesty. If there is a moral Law: if there is a divine Law -- and that there is every intelligent Creature is conscious -- to trample on these Laws, to hold them in Contempt and ; is the highest Exertion of Wickedness, and Impiety, that Mortals can be guilty of. The Author of human Nature, who gave it its Rights, will not see it ruined, and suffer its destroyers to escape with Impunity. Divine Vengeance will sometime or other, overtake the Alberts, the Phillips, and Georges -- the Alvas, the Grislers and Howes, and vindicate the Wrongs of oppressed human Nature. I think that Medals in Gold, Silver and Copper ought to be struck in Commemoration of the shocking Cruelties, the brutal Barbarities and the diabolical Impieties of this War, and these should be contrasted with the Kindness, Tenderness, Humanity and Philanthropy, which have marked the Conduct of Americans towards their Prisoners. It is remarkable, that the Officers and Soldiers of our Enemies, are so totally depraved, so  destitute of the Sentiments of Philanthropy in their own Hearts, that they cannot believe that such delicate Feelings can exist in any other, and therefore have constantly ascribed that Milk and Honey with which We have treated them to Fear, Cowardice, and conscious Weakness. -- But in this they are mistaken, and will discover their Mistake too late to answer any good Purpose for them. "
"Ap. 28, 1777","There is a Clock Calm, at this Time, in the political and military Hemispheres. The Surface is smooth and the Air serene. Not a Breath, nor a Wave. No News, nor Noise. Nothing would promote our Cause more, than Howes March to this Town. Nothing quickens and determines People so much, as a little Smart. -- The Germans, who are numerous and wealthy in this state and who have very imperfect Ideas of Freedom, have a violent Attachment to Property. They are passionate and vindictive, in a Degree that is scarce credible to Persons who are unacquainted with them, and the least Injury to their Property, excites a Resentment and a Rage beyond Description. A few Houses and Plantations plundered, as many would be, if Howe should come here, would set them all on Fire. Nothing would unite and determine   so effectually. The Passions of Men must cooperate with their Reason in the Prosecution of a War. The public may be clearly convinced that a War is just, and yet, their Passions are excited, will carry it languidly on. The Prejudices, the Anger, the Hatred of the English, against the French, contributes greatly to their Valour and Success. The British Court and their Officers, have studied to excite the same Passions in the Breasts of their Soldiers against the Americans, well knowing their powerfull Effect. We, on the Contrary, have treated their Characters with too much Tenderness.  The Howes, their Officers and Soldiers too, ought to be held up to the Contempt, Derision, Hatred and Abhorrence of the Populace in every State, and of the common Soldiers in every Army. It would give me no Pain, to see them burn'd or hang'd in Effigy in every Town and Village. "
"Ap. 29, 1777","This days Post brought me  yours of 17th . inst. and Miss Nabbys obliging  of the 16. This young Lady writes a very pretty Hand, and expresses her Thoughts with great Propriety. I shall hardly excuse Miss from writing to me, so long as I have done, now I find she can write so well. I shall carefully preserve her Letter and if she neglects to write me frequently I shall consider this Letter as Proof that it is not Want of Abilities, but Want of Inclination. The Death of Mrs. Howard I greatly and sincerely lament. She was one of the choice of the Earth. The Account you give me of the Evasions of your Regulations  me not. I detest the Regulations as well as the Embargo. I find it is necessary for me to resign, for I never, of late, think like my Constituents. I am bound by their Sense in Honour and Principle -- But mine differs from them every day. I always knew the Regulations would do more Hurt than good. The  Speculations upon the Health of the Army, were written I suppose by Dr. Rush, as the former ones I know were done by him. There is a letter of 20  from Dr. Lee, which says that  Boston was to be attacked by Ten thousand Germans and three thousand British under Burgoin. But Circumstances since may have altered Cases. "
"April 30, 1777","We have a fine Piece of News this Morning of the March of 2000 of the Enemy, and destroying a fine Magazine there -- and the stupid sordid cowardly torified Country People let them pass without Opposition. All  New England is petrified, with Astonishment, Horror, and Despair, I believe in my Conscience. They behave worse than any Part of the Continent. Even in   2000 Men could not have marched so far. "
"May 1, 1777","This is King Tammany's Day. Tammany was an Indian King, of this Part of the Continent, when Mr. Penn first came here. His Court was in this Town. He was friendly to Mr. Penn and very serviceable to him. He lived here among the first settlers for some Time and  old Age and at last was burnt. Some say he lived here with Mr. Penn when he first came here, and upon Mr. Pens Return he heard of it, and called upon his Grandchildren to lead him down to this Place to see his old Friend. But they went off and left him blind and very old. Upon this the old Man finding himself forsaken, he made him up a large Fire and threw himself into it. The People here have sainted him and keep his day. "
"May 2, 1777","We have promoted Arnold, one Step this day, for his Vigilance, Activity, and Bravery, in the late Affair at  . -- We shall make Huntingdon a Brigadier, I hope. We shall sleep in a whole Skin for some Time I think in  Philadelphia, at least  a strong Reinforcement arrives. I want to learn, where Sir William Erskine with his Two Thousand Men, went after his Exploit at  Danbury. -- Perhaps to  Newport. "
May 4 1777," with this you have an Evening Post, containing some of the tender Mercies of the Barbarians to their Prisoners. If there is a Man, Woman or Child in  America, who can read these Depositions, without Resentment, and Horror, that Person has no soul or a very wicked one. Their Treatment of Prisoners, last Year added to an Act of Parliament, which they have made to enable them to send Prisoners to  England, to be there murthered, with still more relentless Cruelty, in prisons, will bring our Officers and Soldiers to the universal Resolution to conquer or die. This Maxim, conquer or die, never failed to raise a People who adopted it, to the Head of Man kind. An Express from  Portsmouth last night brought Us News of the Arrival of Arms and  enough to enable Us to take Vengeance of these Foes of Human Nature. "
"May 6, 1777","We have no News here but what comes from you -- except that all is well and quiet at  Ticonderoga, that We have four Thousand Troops there, and that they were not afraid of Carlton. The   and People have given Sir Wm. Erskine a  Concord and  Lexington Drubbing. But I am very angry at our People for making a Magazine, so near the Water and among such a Gang of high Church Tories. The Loss however, will not be much felt, as We have many Magazines and a plentifull Supply. Send our Men along and We shall drubb them yet effectually. Ample Vengeance will be yet taken, of these Disturbers of human Nature . . . . There is a chosen Curse, red with uncommon Wrath, yet reserved in the stores of Heaven for these, most mean and most wicked of Men. "
"Philadelphia  May 7, 1777
","We have no News here, except what We get from your Country. The Privateers act with great Spirit, and are blessed with remarkable Success. Some Merchant ships are arrived this Week from  Maryland. They were first chased by Men of War, in attempting to get into   -- they run from them and attempted  Delaware Bay -- there they were chased again. Whereupon they again shifted their course for  Cheasapeak and got in safe in spight of all the Men of War could do. Thus you see We can and will have Trade, in  of them . . . . And this Trade will probably increase fast. It requires Time for The Stream of Commerce to alter its Channell. Time is necessary, for our Merchants and foreign Merchants to think, plan, and correspond with each other. Time is also necessary for our Masters of Vessells and Mariners to become familiar with the Coasts, Ports and Harbours of foreign Countries -- and a longer Time still is needfull for French, Spanish, and Dutch Masters and Mariners to learn our Coasts, and Harbours. "
"Philadelphia  May 10, 1777
","The Day before Yesterday, I took a Walk, with my Friend Whipple to Mrs. Wells's, the Sister of the famous , to see her Waxwork. She has two Chambers filled with it. In one, the Parable of the Prodigal Son, is represented. The Prodigal is prostrate on his Knees, before his Father, whose joy, and Grief, and Compassion all appear in his Eyes and Face, struggling with each other. A servant Maid, at the Fathers command, is pulling down from a Closet Shelf, the choicest Robes, to cloath the Prodigal, who is all in Rags. At an outward Door, in a Corner of the Room stands the elder Brother, chagrined at this Festivity, a Servant coaxing him to come in. A large Number of Guests, are placed round the Room. In another Chamber, are the Figures of Chatham,Franklin, Sawbridge, Mrs. Maccaulay, and several others. At a Corner is a Miser, sitting at his Table, weighing his Gold, his Bag upon one Side of the Table, and a Thief behind him, endeavouring to pilfer the Bag. There is Genius, as well as Taste and Art, discovered in this Exhibition: But I must confess, the whole  was disagreable to me. The Imitation of Life was too faint, and I seemed to be walking among a Group of Corps's, standing, sitting, and walking, laughing, singing, crying, and weeping. This Art I think will make but little Progress in the World. Another Historical Piece I forgot, which is Elisha, restoring to Life the Shunamite's Son. The Joy of the Mother, upon Discerning the first Symptoms of Life in the Child, is pretty strongly expressed. Dr. Chevots Waxwork, in which all the various Parts of the human Body are represented, for the Benefit of young Students in Anatomy and of which I gave you a particular Description, a Year or two ago, were much more pleasing to me. Wax is much fitter to represent dead Bodies, than living ones. Upon a Hint, from one of our Commissioners abroad, We are looking about for American Curiosities, to send across the Atlantic as presents to the Ladies.Mr. Rittenhouse's Planetarium, Mr. Arnolds Collection of  in the Virtuoso Way, which I once saw at  Norwalk in  Connecticutt,  Narragansett Pacing Mares, Mooses, Wood ducks, Flying Squirrells, Redwinged Black birds, Cramberries, and Rattlesnakes have all been thought of. Is not this a pretty Employment for great Statesmen, as We think ourselves to be? Frivolous as it seems, it may be of some Consequence. Little Attentions have great Influence. I think, however, We ought to consult the Ladies upon this Point. Pray what is your Opinion?  "
"Philadelphia  May 10  [1777]
","We have at last accomplished a troublesome Piece of Business. We have chosen a Number of additional Ambassadors. Mr. Ralph Izzard of  S. Carolina, a Gentleman of large Fortune, for the Court of the Grand Duke of  Tuscany, and Mr. William Lee, formerly Alderman of  London, for the Courts of  Vienna and  Berlin.  "
"May 14, 77","Prices with you are much more moderate than here. Yesterday I was obliged to give Forty shillings Pen. Curl Thirty two L.M. for one Gallon of Rum. In my station here, I have Business with many Gentlemen who have occasion to visit me, and I am reduced to the Necessity of treating them with plain Toddy and Rum and Water -- a Glass of Wine, once in a while to a great stranger, of uncommon Consideration. The Prices of Beef, Pork, Veal, Mutton, Poultry, Butter, Cheese, Milk is Three Times higher, here than with you. I live like a Miser, and an Hermit, to save Charges, yet my Constituents will think my  beyond all Bounds. -- My Love to Dr. Tufts. I have received two agreable Letters from him, which I will answer as soon as I can. "
May 15. 1777," Warren writes me, that my Farm never looked better, than when he last saw it, and that Mrs. -- was like to outshine all the Farmers. I wish I could see it. -- But I can make Allowances. He knows the Weakness of his Friends Heart and that nothing flatters it more than praises bestowed upon a certain Lady. I am suffering every day for Want of my farm to ramble in. -- I have been now for near Ten Weeks in a drooping  Way, loaded constantly with a Cold. In the Midst of infinite Noise, Hurry, and Bustle, I lead a lonely melancholly Life, mourning the Loss of all the Charms of Life, which are my family, and all the Amusement that I ever had in Life which is my farm. If the warm Weather, which is now coming on, should not cure my Cold, and make me better I must come home. If it should and I should get tolerably comfortable, I shall stay, and reconcile  to the Misery I here suffer as well as I can. I expect, that I shall be chained to this Oar,  my Constitution both of Mind and Body are totally destroyed, and rendered wholly useless to my self, and Family for the Remainder of my Days. However, now We have got over the dreary, , torpid Winter, when We had no Army, not even Three Thousand Men to protect Us against all our Enemies foreign and domestic; and now We have got together a pretty respectable Army, which renders Us tolerably secure against both, I doubt not, We shall be able to perswade some Gentleman or other, in the Massachusetts, to vouch safe, to undertake the dangerous Office of Delegate to Congress. However, I will neither whine, nor croak. The Moment our Affairs are in a prosperous Way and a little more out of Doubt -- that Moment I become a private Gentleman, the  Husband of Mrs. the amiable Mrs. A. of B. and the affectionate Father of her Children, two Characters, which I have scarcely supported for these three Years past, having done the Duties of neither.

","I never fail to  to you the News papers, which contain the most of the Intelligence that comes to my Knowledge. I am obliged to slacken my Attention to Business a little, and ride and walk for the Sake of my Health, which is but infirm. -- Oh that I could wander, upon Penns Hill, and in the Meadows and Mountains in its  free from Care! But this is a Felicity too great for me. Mr. Gorham and Mr. Russell are here with a Petition from  . It grieves me that they are to return without success. I feel, most exquisitely, for the unhappy People of that Town. Their Agents have done every Thing in their Power, or in the Power of Men to do, and the  Mass. Delegates have seconded their Efforts to the Utmost of their Power, but all in vain. The Distress of the States, arising from the Quantity of Money abroad, and the monstrous Demands that would be made from  Virginia,  ,  N. York and elsewhere, if a Precedent should be once set, has determined the Congress, almost with Tears in their Eyes, to withstand this Application at present. Every Man expressed the Utmost Tenderness and Humanity, upon the Occasion: But at the same Time every Man except the   Delegates expressed his full Conviction of the ill Policy of granting any Thing at present. "
"May 21, 1777","Dont be two much alarmed at the Report of an Attack of  Boston. The British Court are pursuing a system which in the End I think they will find . They are alarming the Fears of the People, every where. Wentworths Letter was contrived to terrify  Portsmouth. -- Other Threats are given out against  Boston. Others against the Eastern shore of Virginia and  Maryland. Now  Philadelphia is to be invaded -- then  Albany. Sometimes  New London, at others  N. Haven. After all they will make but a poor Figure this Summer. There is some Reason to think, they have sent to  Canada, for the Troops there by Water. Their Reinforcement from Europe, I think will not be great. Our Army is grown pretty strong. Pray let my dear Countrymen turn out, and not let a Man be wanting of their Quota. The Enemy will find it  to awaken the Apprehensions of so many People. Because when the Peoples Fears subside which most of them will, they will be succeeded by Contempt. My Eyes are weak again, and I am in bad Health but I keep about. I ride every fair Morning and walk every pleasant Evening, so that I cannot write so often as I wish. -- Have received no Letter from you by the two last Posts. The Country here looks most deliciously and the Singing Birds of which Species there is here a great Variety are inspired. The Spring is backward but promised great Fertility, Plenty and Abundance. I wish I could see your Garden and little Farm. "
May 22  [1777]. 4 O Clock in the Morning,"After a Series of the souerest, and harshest Weather that ever I felt in this Climate, We are at last, blessed with a bright Sun and a soft Air. The Weather here has been like our old Easterly Winds to me, and southerly Winds to you. The Charms of the Morning at this Hour, are . The Streakes of Glory dawning in the East: the freshness and Purity in the Air, the bright blue of the sky, the sweet Warblings of a great Variety of Birds intermingling with the martial Clarions of an hundred Cocks now within my Hearing, all conspire to chear the Spirits. This kind of puerile Description is a very pretty Employment for an old Fellow whose Brow is furrowed with the Cares of  and War. I shall be on Horseback in a few Minutes, and then I shall enjoy the Morning, in more Perfection. I spent last Evening at the War -- Office, with General Arnold .. . . He has been basely slandered and libelled.  The Regulars say,  ""he fought like Julius Caesar."" I am wearied to Death with the Wrangles between military officers, high and low. They  like Cats and Dogs. They worry one another like Mastiffs. Scrambling for Rank and Pay like Apes for Nutts. I believe there is no one Principle, which predominates in human Nature so much in every stage of Life, from the Cradle to the Grave, in Males and females, old and young, black and white, rich and poor, high and low, as this Passion for Superiority .... Every human Being compares itself in its own Imagination, with every other round about it, and will find some Superiority over every other real or imaginary, or it will die of Grief and Vexation. I have seen it among Boys and Girls at school, among Lads at , among Practicers at the Bar, among the Clergy in their Associations, among Clubbs of Friends, among the People in Town Meetings, among the Members of an House of Reps. [Representatives], among the Grave Councillors, on the more solemn Bench of justice, and in that awfully August Body the Congress, and on many of its Committees -- and among Ladies every Where -- But I never saw it operate with such Keenness, Ferocity and Fury, as among military Officers. They will go terrible Lengths, in their Emulations, their Envy and Revenge, in Consequence of it. So much for Philosophy. -- I hope my five or six Babes are all well. My Duty to my Mother and your Father and Love to sisters and Brothers, Aunts and Uncles. Pray how does your Asparagus perform? &c. I would give Three Guineas for a Barrell of your  -- not one drop is to be had here for Gold. And wine is not to be had under Six or Eight Dollars a Gallon and that very bad. I would give a Guinea for a Barrell of your Beer. The small beer here is wretchedly bad. In short I can get nothing that I can drink, and I believe I shall be sick from this Cause alone. Rum at forty shillings a Gallon and bad Water, will never do, in this hot Climate in summer where Acid Liquors are necessary against Putrefaction. "

","We have an Army in  the Jersies, so respectable that We seem to be under no Apprehensions at present, of an Invasion of  Philadelphia at least  a powerfull Reinforcement shall arrive from  Europe. When that will be and how powerfull, it is impossible to say: But I think, it will not be very soon, nor very strong. Perhaps, the Troops from  Canada may come round by Water. If they do, the whole Force they can make, with all the Reinforcements from  Europe will do no great Things this Year. I think, our Cause will never again be in so low a state as it was last December -- then was the Crisis. There are four Men of War and four Tenders in  Delaware Bay. The Roebuck, and a Fifty Gun ship, and two other Frigates, are the Men of War. They come up the River a little Way to get Water sometimes with Fear and Trembling, and dare not come up far enough to get fresh Water, but content themselves with brackish Water. They go on shore sometimes to steal some lean Cattle, if any happen to wander into lonely Places, where they dare venture. "
"May 25, 1777","At half past four this Morning, I mounted my Horse, and took a ride, in a Road that was new to me. I went to  Kensington, and then to Point No Point, by Land, the Place where I went, once before, with a large Company in the Rowe Gallies, by Water. That Frolic was almost two Years ago. I gave you a Relation of it, in the Time, I suppose. The Road to Point No Point lies along the  River Delaware, in fair Sight of it, and its opposite shore. For near four Miles the Road is as strait as the Streets of  Philadelphia. On each Side, are  Rowes of Trees, Buttonwoods, Oaks, Walnutts, Cherries and Willows, especially down towards the Banks of the River. The Meadows, Pastures, and Grass Plotts, are as Green as Leeks. There are many Fruit Trees and fine orchards, set with the nicest Regularity. But the Fields of Grain, the Rye, and Wheat, exceed all Description. These Fields are all sown in Ridges; and the Furrough between each Couple of Ridges, is as plainly to be seen, as if a swarth had been mown along. Yet it is no wider than a Plough share, and it is as strait as an Arrow. It looks as if the Sower had gone along the Furrough with his Spectacles to pick up every grain that should accidentally fall into it. The Corn is just coming out of the Ground. The Furroughs struck out for the Hills to be planted in, are each Way, as straight as mathematical right Lines; and the Squares between every four Hills, as exact as they could be done by Plumb and Line, or Scale and Compass. I am ashamed of our Farmers. They are a lazy, ignorant , in Husbandry, I mean -- For they know infinitely more of every Thing else, than these. But after all the Native Face of our Country, diversified as it is, with Hill and Dale, Sea and Land, is to me more agreable than this enchanting artificial scaene. The Post brought me  yours of May 6th .  and 9th . You express Apprehensions that We may be driven from this City. We have No such Apprehensions here.  is unable to do any Thing but by Stealth.Washington is strong enough to keep Howe, where he is. How could it happen that you should have 5 of counterfeit  New Hampshire Money? Cant you recollect who you had it of? Let me  you not to take a shilling of any but continental Money, or  Massachusetts -- and be very carefull of that. There is a Counterfeit Continental Bill abroad sent out of  New York but it will deceive none but Fools, for it is Copper Plate -- easily detected, miserably done. "
"Philadelphia  May 28, 1777
","An horrid cold Day for Election -- warm work however, in the Afternoon, I suppose. You will see by the  Papers, among the Advertisements, how the Spirit of Manufacturing grows. There never was a Time when there was such full Employment, for every Man, Woman and Child, in this City. Spinning, Knitting, Weaving, every Tradesman is as full as possible. Wool and Flax in great Demand. Industry will supply our Necessities, if it is not cramped by injudicious Laws -- such as Regulations of Prices &c., Embargoes &c. These discourage Industry and turn that Ingenuity which ought to be employed for the  general Good, into Knavery. "
June 2 1777,"Yesterday, I took a ride to a  Hill eleven Miles out of Town. It is called  Rush Hill. An old Lady Mrs. Morris and her Daughter Mrs. Stamper, live here with a Couple of servants, and one little Boy, who is left with the Family for Education. It is the most airy, and at the same Time the most rural Place in . The good Lady has about sixty Acres of Land, two fine orchards, an excellent Garden, a charming Brook, beautifull Meadows and Clover in Abundance. This excellent Lady is the Mother of Dr. Rush and Mr. Jacob Rush the Lawyer. I went out with the Lawyer, and I relished the Excursion the more because I know the Pleasure of visiting a Mother. -- This ride has refreshed me much. I ride every day. A fine growing Season here --  Crops -- and at present perfect Peace. My Love to  J. C. and Th. Pray how does the other one, or two? "
Monday June 2. 1777,"Artillery Election! -- I wish I was at it, or near it. Yours of the 18th . reached me this Morning. The Cause that Letters are so long in travelling, is that there is but one Post in a Week who goes from hence to  Peeks Kill,  there are two that go from thence to  Boston. Riding every day, has made me better than I was,  I am not yet quite well. I am determined to continue this Practice, which is very necessary for me. I rejoice to find, that the Town have had the Wisdom to send but one . The House last Year was too numerous and unwieldy. The Expence was too great. I suppose you will have a Constitution formed this Year. Who will be the Moses, the Lycurgus, the Solon? Or have you a score or two of such? Whoever they may be and whatever Form may be adopted, I am perswaded there is among the Mass of our People a Fund of Wisdom, Integrity and Humanity, which will preserve their Happiness, in a tolerable Measure. If the Enemy come to  Boston again, fly with your little ones all of them to Philadelphia. But they will scarcely get to  Boston, this Campaign. I admire your Sentiments concerning Revenge. Revenge, in ancient Days, you will see it through the whole Roman History, was esteemed a generous, and an heroic Passion. Nothing was too good for a Friend or too bad for an Enemy. Hatred and Malice, without Limits, against an Enemy, was indulged, was justified, and no Cruelty was thought unwarrantable. Our Saviour taught the Immorality of Revenge, and the moral Duty of forgiving Injuries, and even the Duty of loving Enemies. Nothing can  the amiable, the moral, and divine Excellency of these Christian Doctrines in a stronger Point of Light, than the Characters and Conduct of Marius and Sylla, Caesar, Pompey, Anthony and Augustus, among innumerable others. Retaliation, we must practice, in some Instances, in order to make our barbarous Foes respect in some degree the Rights of Humanity. But this will never be done without the most palpable Necessity. The Apprehension of Retaliation alone, will restrain them from Cruelties which would disgrace Savages. To omit it then would be cruelty to ourselves, our Officers and Men. We are amused here with Reports of Troops removing from  ,  N. York,Staten Island &c. -- Waggons, Boats, Bridges &c. prepared -- two old Indiamen cutt down into floating Batteries mounting 32 Guns sent round into  Delaware R. [River] &c. &c. But I heed it no more, than the whistling of the Zephyrs. In short I had rather they should come to  Philadelphia than not. It would either purify this City of its Dross. Either the Furnace of Affliction would refine it of its Impurities, or it would be purged yet so as by fire. This Town has been a dead Weight, upon Us -- it would be a dead Weight also upon the Enemy. The Mules here would plague them more than all their Money. "
"June 4, 1777","I wish I could know, whether your season is cold or warm, wet or dry, or barren. Whether you had late Frosts. Whether those Frosts have hurt the Fruit, the Flax, the Corn or Vines, &c. We have a fine season here and a bright Prospect of Abundance. You will see by the  Papers, in a Letter from my Friend Parsons, a very handsome Narration of one of the prettiest Exploits of this War -- a fine Retaliation for the  Danbury Mischief. Meigs who was before esteemed a good Officer has acquired by this Expedition a splendid Reputation. You will see by the same Papers too, that the Writers here in Opposition to the Constitution of  , are making a factious Use of my Name and Lucubrations. Much against my Will, I assure you, for altho I am no Admirer  of the Form of this Government, yet I think it is agreable to the Body of the People, and if they please themselves they will please me. And I would not withchoose to be impressed into the service of one Party, or the other -- and I am determined I will not inlist. Besides it is not very genteel in these Writers, to put my Name to a Letter, from which I cautiously withheld it myself. However, let them take their own Way. I shant trouble myself about it. I am growing better, by Exercise and Air. I must write a Letter, in Behalf of Mr. Thaxter, to the Bar and Bench in Boston, in order to get him sworn, at July Court. Will my Brother, when the Time comes, officiate for his Brother at a Christening? If it is a young Gentleman call him William after your Father -- if a Young Lady, call her Elizabeth after your Mother, and sister. "
"June 8, 1777","Upon an Invitation from the Board of War of  , a Committee was appointed a few days ago to go down  Delaware River and take a View of the Works there, erected with a View to prevent the Enemy from coming up to  Philadelphia by Water. Mr. Duer, your humble servant and Mr. Middleton made the Committee. Yesterday we went, in three Boats, with Eight Oars each. Mr. Rittenhouse, Bull and Coll. Deane, went from the  Pensilvania Board of War. General Arnold, General De Coudrai, an experienced french officer of Artillery, Monsr. Le Brune, an Engineer, and Mr. Rogers an Aid de Camp of Gen. De Coudray were in Company. We had a Band of  in Company which is very agreable upon the Water. We went first to  Billingsport, about 10 Miles down the River on the Jersey side, where the River is obstructed with Vesseaux de Frizes, and where a large Fort is laid out with a great deal of Work done upon it. We then came back to  Fort Island, or  Province Island, where the River is obstructed again, and the only Passage for  is commanded by a Fort of 18. 18. Pounders.  Here lay the Fire ships, Fire Rafts, floating Batteries, Gallies and the Andrew Doria, and the fine new Frigate Delaware. We then crossed the River and went to   on the Jersey side, where Coll. Bull has thrown up the strongest Works that I have ever seen. Here We dined, and after Dinner Coll. Bull ordered out his Regiment upon the Parade, where they went through their Exercises and Maneuvres, very well. We had a long Passage home and made it 9 o Clock before We reached the Wharf. We suffered much with the Heat, yet upon the whole it was an  day. Upon our Return to Town We expected to hear some News but not a Word had been received. All is quiet still. How long will this Calm continue? I begin to suspect We shall have an unactive Campaign -- that  will shut himself up, in some impregnable Post, and lie still. We shall see, however, and I think We shall trouble him whether he moves or lies still. "

","This Week has produced an happy Reconciliation between the two Parties in this City and Commonwealth, the Friends of the new Constitution and those who wish for Amendments in it . . .. Mifflin invited the People to assemble in the State House Yard, at the Desire of , who sent them an Account that the Motions of the Enemy indicated an intention to begin an Expedition, and that every Appearance intimated this City to be their Object. Mifflin made an , in which he applauded the Exertions of the Citizens last December, ascribed the successes of  Trenton and  Princeton to their Behaviour and exhorted them to the same Spirit, Unanimity and Firmness, upon this occasion. Advised them to choose their Officers, under the new Militia Law and meet him in the common on Fryday. The Citizens by loud shouts and Huzzas, promised him to turn out, and accordingly, they met him in great Numbers Yesterday. Mean Time, Generals Armstrong, Mifflin and Reed, waited on the Assembly, to  with them, to gratify those who wished Amendments in the Constitution with an Appeal to the People. The Pensilvania Board of War too, applied, for the same Purpose as you will see by one of the  Papers. The House agreed to it. Thus the Dispute is in a Way to be determined, and a Coalition formed. Yesterday We had an Alarm, and News that the Enemy were on their March, towards  Philadelphia in two Divisions -- one at  Shanks Mills 8 miles from Brunswick, the other at Ten Mile Run, about Ten Miles from  Brunswick on another Road, a Road that goes to  Corells  Ferry. We feel pretty bold, here. -- If they get  Philadelphia, they will hang a Mill stone about their Necks. They must evacuate  . The Jersey Militia have turned out, with great Spirit. Magistrates and Subjects, Clergy and Laity, have all marched, like so many Yankees. If  should get over the  Delaware River, and We should not have an Army to stop him, Congress I suppose will remove, fifty or sixty Miles into the Country. But they will not move hastily. Riding and walking, have given me tolerable Health, and I must confess my Spirits, notwithstanding the Difficulties We have to encounter, are very good. "

I know not what would become of me, and mine, if I had not such a Friend to take Care of my Interests in my Absence. You will have Patience with me this Time, I hope, for this Time will be the last. I shall stay out this Year, if I can preserve my Health, and then come home, and bid farewell to great Affairs. I have a Right to spend the Remainder of my days in small ones. "

He is an Artillery Officer.  is here too, a great Writer upon Horsemanship and Cavalry. He has presented me with two Volumes written by himself upon these subjects, elegantly printed, bound and gilt. Mr. De Vallenais is with him, who speaks very good English. The  Papers will give you all the News. You get Intelligence sooner and better than We.

","My dearest Friend It would give Pleasure to  your Way but the few, unfeeling Tories, to see what a Spirit prevails here. The  which How was foolish enough to spread by his March out of Brunswick, raised the Militia of   [the] Jersies universally, and in this City it united the Whiggs, to exert themselves under their new Militia Law, in such a Degree that nobody here was under any Apprehensions of danger from Hows March. It seemed to be the general Wish that he might persevere in his March that he might meet with certain Destruction. But the poor Wretches have skulked back to  Brunswick. -- This is a great Disgrace. It will be considered so in Europe. It is certainly thought so by our People, and it will be felt to be so by their own People -- the poor Tories especially. It will dispirit that Army in such a manner, that Desertions will become very numerous. The Tories in this Town seem to be in absolute Despair. Chopfallen, in a most remarkable Manner. The Quakers begin to say they are not Tories -- that their Principle of passive Obedience will not allow them to be , but that they are as far from being Tories as the Presbyterians. The true Secret of all this is, We have now got together a fine Army, and more are coming in every day. An Officer arrived from  Virginia, this day, says he passed by Three Thousand continental Troops between   and this Town. -- I am with an Affection, that neither Time nor Place can abate,  Yours, ever Yours.

","My dearest Friend The enclosed Newspapers will communicate to you, all the News I know. The Weather here begins to be very hot. Poor Mortals pant and sweat, under the burning Skies. Faint and feeble as children, We seem as if We were dissolving away. Yet We live along. The two Armies are now playing off their Arts. Each acts with great Caution. Howe is as much afraid of putting any Thing to Hazard as Washington. What would Britain do, surrounded with formidable Powers in Europe just ready to strike her if Howes Army should meet a Disaster? Where would she find another Army? How are you? -- I hope very well. -- Let Mr. Thaxter write, let the Children write, when you cannot. I am very anxious, but Anxiety at 400 Miles distance can do you no more good, than me. I long to hear a certain Piece of News from Home, which will give me great joy. Thank Mr. John for his kind Letter. I will answer  him and all my little Correspondents as soon as I can. Tell Mr. John, that I am under no Apprehensions about his Proficiency in Learning. With his Capacity, and Opportunities, he can not fail to acquire Knowledge. But let him know, that the moral Sentiments of his Heart, are more important than the Furniture of his Head. Let him be sure that he possesses the great Virtues of Temperance, Justice, Magnanimity,  and Generosity, and with these added to his Parts he cannot fail to become a wise and great Man. Does he read the Newspapers? The Events of this War, should not pass unobserved by him at his Years. As he reads History you should ask him, what Events strike him most? What Characters he esteems and admires? which he hates and abhors? which he despises? No doubt he makes some Observations, young as he is. Treachery, Perfidy, Cruelty, Hypocrisy, Avarice, &c. &c. should be pointed out to him for his Contempt as well as Detestation. My dear Daughters Education is near my Heart. She will suffer by this War as well as her Brothers. But she is a modest, and discreet Child. Has an excellent Disposition, as well as Understanding. Yet I wish it was in my Power, to give her the Advantages of several Accomplishments, which it is not. "

","We have no News: a long, cold, raw, northeast Storm has chilled our Blood, for two days past. It is unusual, to have a storm from that Point, in June and July. It is an Omen no doubt. Pray what can it mean? I have so little Ingenuity, at interpreting the Auspices, that I am unable to say whether it bodes Evil to , or to Us. I rather think it augurs a fine Crop of Wheat, Rye, Barley, Corn, Spelts, Buckwheat, and Grass. It is a Presage of Plenty. Therefore let the Land rejoice. Flax and Cotton will grow, the better for this Weather. The News Papers, , with this, will tell you all, that I know concerning the military operations in  N. Jersey.

Before this Letter is sealed, which will not be till Sunday next, I hope I shall be able to inform you better. I rejoice at your fine Season, and  at my Brother Cranches Attention to Husbandry. Am very glad he bought the Farm, and that he likes it so well. I pant for domestic Life, and rural Felicity like his. I am better than I have been. But I dread the Heats, which are coming on. This Day  Six Months since I left you. I am wasted and exhausted in Mind and Body, with incessant Application to Business, but if I can possibly endure it, will hold out the Year. It is nonsense to dance backwards and forwards. After this Year I shall take my Leave. Our Affairs are in a fine prosperous Train, and if they continue so, I can leave this Station with . Next Month  Three Years, that I have been devoted to the Servitude of Liberty. A slavery it has been to me, whatever the World may think of it. To a Man, whose Attachments to his Family, are as strong as mine Absence alone from such a Wife and such Children, would be a great sacrifice. But in Addition to this , what have I not done? what have I not suffered? What have I not hazarded? -- These are Questions that I may ask you, but I will ask such Questions of no else. Let the  [illegible]  Cymballs of Popularity tinckle still. Let the Butterflies of Fame glitter with their Wings. I shall envy neither their Musick nor their Colours. The Loss of Property affects me little. All other hard Things , but the Loss of your Company and that of my dear Babes I so long a Time, I consider as a Loss of so much solid Happiness. The tender social Feelings of my Heart, which have distressed me beyond all Utterance, in my most busy, active , as well as in the numerous Hours of melancholly solitude, are known only to God and my own soul. How often have I seen my dearest Friend a Widow and her Charming Prattlers Orphans, exposed to all the Insolence of unfeeling impious Tyrants!

I had the  to serve with him upon the naval Committee, who laid the first Foundations, the Corner Stone of an American navy, by fitting to Sea the Alfred, Columbus, Cabott, Andrew Doria, Providence, and several others. An Honour, that I make it a Rule to boast of, upon all Occasions, and I hope my Posterity will have Reason to boast .... Hewes has a sharp Eye and keen, penetrating Sense, but what is of much more Value is a Man of Honour and Integrity. If he should call upon you, and you should be about, I hope you will treat him with all the Complaisance that is due to his Character. I almost envy him his Journey, altho he travells for his Health, which at present is infirm.  I am yours, yours, yours,  John Adams  My dearest Friend My dearest Friend We have had no News from Camp for 3 or 4 days. Mr. How, by the last Advices, was  his Fleet and Army in such a Manner, as  [to] give Us Expectations of an Expedition, some where. But whether to  Rhode Island,  Hallifax, up the North River or the  Delaware, is left to Conjecture. I am much in doubt whether he knows his own Intentions. A Faculty of penetrating into the Designs of an Enemy is said to be the first Quality of a General. But it is impossible to discover the Designs of an Enemy who has no Design at all. An Intention that has no Existence, a   Plan that is not laid, cannot be divined.

I am much afraid, We shall loose that Post, as We did  Forts Washington and Lee, and indeed, I believe We shall if the Enemy surround it. But it will prove no Benefit to them. I begin to Wish there was not a Fort upon the Continent. Discipline and Disposition, are our Resources. It is our Policy to draw the Enemy into the Country, where We can avail ourselves of Hills, Woods, Walls, Rivers, Defiles &c.  our Soldiers are more inured to War.  and Burgoine will not be able to meet, this Year, and if they were met, it would only be better for Us, for We should draw all our Forces to a Point too. If they were met, they could not  off the Communication, between the Northern and Southern States.

I have inclosed you the Newspapers and written you a Line, every Week, for several Months past. If there is one Week passes without bringing you a Letter from me, it is because the Post does not its Duty. After another Week, you will probably write me no more Letters for some Days. But I hope you will make Mr. Thaxter, or somebody write.  or Mr. John may write. We have another  Fort Washington and  Fort Lee affair at  Ticonderoga. I hope at last We shall learn Wisdom. I wished that Post evacuated Three Months ago. We are Fools if We attempt at present to maintain Posts, near navigable Water. As to the Tories, I think our General Court would do well to imitate the Policy of  , who have enjoyned an Oath to be taken by all the People, which has had an amazing Effect. The Tories have been tolerated, even to long Suffering. Beings so unfeeling, unnatural, , as to join an Enemy of their Country so unprincipled, unmerciless and blood thirsty, deserve a Punishment much severer than Banishment. But you should establish an Oath, and outlaw all who will not take it that is suffer them to hold no Office, to vote no where for any Thing, to bring no Action, to take out no Execution. I am grieved to hear that our Fruit is injured by the Frost because as Wine and Rum will wholly fail, from the stoppages of Trade,  will be our only Resource.

Notwithstanding the Mortification arising from such Considerations, yet I can truly say that this Event is a Relief to my Mind, for I have a long Time expected this Catastrophe, and that it would be aggravated by the Loss of the Garrison, which it seems has been happily saved. My only Hope of holding that Post, has been a long Time founded in a Doubt whether the Enemy had Force enough in  Canada, to attempt it. The Design of the Enemy, is now no doubt to attack poor  New England on all sides, from  Rhode Island,  New York and  Ticonderoga. But I believe their Progress will be stopped, for our Army is pretty numerous, and Discipline, upon which alone We must finally depend, under Providence, for Success, is advancing.

I hope the People with you will not be too much dejected at the Loss. Burgoine is a wild Man, and will rush into some inconsiderate Measures, which will put him in our Power, but if not, his Career will be stopped.

","My best friend I have long sought for a  History of the Revolution in the low Countries, when the Seven united Provinces seperated from the Kingdom of  Spain, but without the Success that I wished, untill a few days ago. Sir William Temples Account is elegant and entertaining, but very brief and general. Puffendorfs , I have not yet seen. Grotius's I have seen, and read in Part, but it is in Latin, and I had it not in my Possession long enough, to make myself master of the whole. A few days ago, I heard for the first Time, of an History of the Wars in Flanders, written in Italian by Cardinal Bentivoglio, and translated into English by the Earl of Monmouth. The Cardinal was a Spaniard and a Tory, and his History has about as much Candor towards the Flemish and their Leaders as Clarendon has towards Pym and Hampden, and Cromwell.  The Book is in Folio, and is embellished with a Map of the Country and with the Portraits of about Thirty of the Principal Characters. , who lent me the Book, told me, that in the Year 1765 or 6, being in  England, he was invited together with Dr. Franklin to spend a Week in the Country with a Mr. Steel a Gentleman of Fortune,  [illegible]   at present an eloquent Speaker in the Society of Arts, descended from Sir Richard Steel. Upon that Visit Mr. Steel told them that the Quarrell which was now begun by the Stamp Act would never be reconciled, but would terminate in a Separation between the two Countries. -- Ingersol was surprized at the Praediction and asked why and how? -- I cant tell you why [illegible]   how says he, but if you want to know how why, when you return to  London, enquire at the Booksellers for Bentivoglios History of the Wars in  Flanders, read it through, and you will be convinced that such Quarrells cannot be made up. He bought the Book accordingly and has now lent it to me.  It is very similar to the American Quarrell in the Rise and Progress, and will be so in the Conclusion. "

I wait with Impatience for Monday Morning, when the Post is to arrive. I am more Anxious, now, than ever, on another Account. The Enemy's Fleet has sailed -- But to what Place, they are destined, is unknown. Some conjecture Philadelphia, some  Rhode Island, and some, that they mean only a Feint and intend soon to return to the  North River. If they go to  Rhode Island, I suppose they will not remain inactive there, which will throw you and your  into Distress. Poor, unhappy I! who have never an opportunity to share with my Family, their Distresses, nor to contribute in the least degree to relieve them! I suffer more in solitary silence, than I should if I were with them. "
"Philadelphia  July 28, 1777
","My dearest Friend Never in my whole Life, was my Heart affected with such Emotions and Sensations, as were this Day occasioned by  your Letters of the 9.   10 .  11 . and 16 of July . Devoutly do I return Thanks to God, whose kind Providence has preserved to me a Life that is dearer to me than all other Blessings in this World. Most fervently do I pray, for a Continuance of his Goodness in the  Restoration of my best Friend to perfect Health. Is it not unaccountable, that one should feel so strong an Affection for an Infant, that one has never seen, nor shall see? Yet I must confess to you, the Loss of this sweet little Girl, has most tenderly and sensibly affected me. I feel a Grief and Mortification, that is heightened the it is not wholly occasioned, by my Sympathy with the Mother. My dear little  Tears are sweetly becoming her generous Tenderness and sensibility of Nature. They are Arguments too of her good sense and Discretion. "

","My dearest Friend I am sorry to find by your late Letter what indeed I expected to hear, that my Farm wants manure. I fear by your Expressions that your Crop of Hay falls short. But, there has been an Error in our Husbandry in which We have been very inconsiderate and extravagant, that is in pasturing the Mowing Ground. This will ruin any Farm. The true Maxim of profitable Husbandry is to contrive every Means for the Maintenance of Stock. -- Increase your Cattle and  your Farm. -- We bestow too much manure upon Corn -- too little upon Grass. Make Manure, make food for Cattle, increase your stock -- this is the Method.  Fleet has been at Sea, these 8 days. We know not where he is gone. We are puzzling ourselves in vain, to conjecture his Intention. Some guess he is gone to  Cheasapeak, to land near  Susquehanna and cross over Land to  Albany to meet Burgoine. But they might as well imagine them gone round  Cape horn into the South Seas to land at  California, and march across the Continent to attack our back settlements. Others think them gone to  Rhode Island, others think they mean only a Deception and to return to the North River. A few days will reveal their Scheme .... We have now before Us, the Months of August, September, October and November, for the Operations of the Campaign. -- Time enough for Mischief.  is so near this City, that if the Enemy come into  Delaware Bay, he will meet them before they can come near this City. "
"Philadelphia  August 1, 1777
","My best Friend The Fleet is in  Delaware Bay. 228 of them were seen, in the Offing, from Cape Henlopen, the day before yesterday. They come in but slowly. G. Washington, and the light Horse came into Town last Night. His Army will be in, this day -- that is the two or three first Divisions of it -- Greens, Sterlings and Stevensons  [Stephen's]. The rest is following on, as fast as possible. General Nash with about 1500 North Carolina Forces, has taken Post on the Heights of  Chester, about 15 miles below this City on the River. The Fire Ships &c. are ready. I really think that  Providence has ordered this Country to be the Theatre of this Summers Campaign, in  to Us, for many Reasons. 1. It will make an entire and final Seperation of the Wheat from the Chaff, the Ore from the Dross, the Whiggs from the Tories. 2. It will give a little Breath to you in  N. England. 3. If they should fail in their Attempt upon  Philadelphia, it will give Lustre to our Arms and Disgrace to theirs, but if they succeed, it will cutt off this corrupted City, from the Body of the Country, and it will take all their Force to maintain it. "

","My best Friend By an express last night from  Cape May, We learn that the Fleet went out of the Bay, the Morning before, i.e. on Thursday Morning and put to Sea, and went out of Sight. What this Man is after, no Wisdom can discover. Last night another Express says the Fleet appeared  again, i.e. part of it, upwards of one hundred Sail. After all these Feints and , it is most likely he designs to run up the  North River, by and by. The hot weather grows burthensome. And our Business thickens, and presses. I feel as if I could hardly get along through this Month and the next. But must see it out as well as I can. We have News from  France, from our Embassadors. The French will not declare War, as yet. They tell the English they neither desire War nor fear it. But they will lend Us Money, and they have sold Us Eighty thousand Stands of Arms, and will aid Us in every indirect Way. So will  Spain. I hope by this Time you are in perfect Health.  Post, I hope will confirm the most agreable Account, in the last I received from you, of your being in a good Way. My Health and Spirits and Life are bound up in yours. May Heaven preserve my dearest Friend, and make her happy. Never was Wretch, more weary of Misery than I am of the Life I lead, condemned to the dullest servitude and Drudgery,  from all that I love, and wedded to all that I hate. Digging in a Potato Yard upon my own Garden and living in my own Family would be to me Paradise. The next Time I come home, shall be for a long Time. "
"Philadelphia  August 4, 1777
","My dearest Friend Your kind   of July 23 , came by the Post, this Morning. It revives me, to hear of your Health, and Welfare,altho I shall be, and am disappointed of a Blessing, which I hoped to enjoy. But this is the Result of Wisdom superiour to ours and must be submitted to with chearfull Resignation. The Loss of  Ti . has occasioned as loud Complaints and as keen Resentment in Philadelphia as in  Boston. And Congress have determined that an Inquiry shall be made, and have ordered the Major Generals Schuyler and St. Clair, to Head Quarters and ordered M.G. Gates to relieve M.G. Schuyler. Lincoln and Arnold are there. These three I believe will restore our Affairs in that Department. We have Letters from  France,  Spain and the  West Indies, which  that our Ground in  Europe is firm, and that a War is brewing. We have all the English Papers, till the latter End of May, which  that  Britain is in a wretched Condition indeed -- their  East India Affairs in Distraction, their Affrican Trade ruined and their West Indian  Concerns in the Utmost Distress. Almost all their  West India Planters have left in the Kingdom in Despair. Their Scavengers of the Streets of  Germany have been able to rake together, but a little Filth. Where How is going No  can determine. He has left the  Capes of Delaware and where he is gone no one can tell. -- We expect to hear from him at the  North River, or at  Rhode Island, but cant tell when. I, for my Part am very homesick, but I will not leave the Field  the Campaign is ended -- unless I should fall sick. This horrid Hot Weather melts my Marrow within my Bones, and makes me faint away almost. I have no other Way to keep alive, but by Abstinence from Eating and drinking. I should not live a Month if I did not starve myself. When I come home I shall be an Epicure. Tell Tom, I would give a Guinea to have him climb upon my shoulder, and another to chase him into his jail. -- My Love to all the rest. I will write them as soon as I can. I wrote  inclosing Letters to the Court and Bar. Has he received them? "

Some Conjecture  Charlestown S.C. -- others,  Georgia -- others  . For my Part, I have formed an Opinion, in which I am as clear and positive as ever I was in my Life. I think I can adduce Arguments enough to convince any impartial, cool Mind, that I am in the Right. My Opinion is, that four Months Time will discover where the Fleet is gone -- perhaps less Time than that. Some begin to be whimsical, and guess them gone to the  West Indies. But this is impossible. Some surmise   -- some old  England. But these are too flattering Conjectures. "

","My dearest We have not yet the least Intimation of  Design. He is wasting away the Time. Let him aim at what Object he will, he will have scarcely Time to secure that, and will have none left to pursue his Advantage, if he gains any.  I hope will be checked, and driven back. I hope the New Englandmen will now exert themselves, for it has cost Us, severe Conflicts, to get Affairs in that Department, in the Order they are. Gates cost Us a great deal of Pains. "

","I have concluded to run the  of sending Turner Home. It will save me the Expence of his Board and Horse. The Moment he arrives, I hope you will send his Horse to  Boston to be sold at Vendue. If he rides the Horse let him be sold immediately. If he rides the Mare, you may keep her if you  to do so and sell the old Horse, provided the Mare will go in a Carriage which must be tried, because I dont know that she ever was in one. We have heard nothing from the Enemys Fleet, since they left the  Capes of Delaware. They may intend for  Philadelphia yet, which makes me a little irresolute about sending away my Man and Horse  without which I should be puzzled to get away from this Place, if it should be invaded. I believe I shall delay his journey for a few days. Perhaps We shall hear more within that Time. This day  Seven Months, since I left all that I delight in. When shall I return? Not untill the Year is out, provided I can keep myself tolerably well. Our Accounts from the Northward are still gloomy.  is gone, and I hope will restore some degree of Spirits and Confidence there. Burgoigne is laying himself open to destruction, in that Quarter, every day. It is strange that no Check is given him. These vile , that seize People and Soldiers too, are very difficult to get over.  -- But at last they turn to , Fury and Desperation, as they did in the jerseys. I suppose a few Tories in  New York, in the Grants and in  Berkshire and  Hampshire will join Burgoigne, but they will soon repent their rash Folly, and be sick of their Masters. For indeed they will find that neither Burgoigne nor Howe, nor their Master are kind Masters. The longer We live, the more clearly We see, that nothing will serve our Purpose, but discipline and Experience. Discipline -- Discipline, is wanting and must be introduced. The Affair of Ti. will introduce it. The Public calls for justice, and will have it. This Demand does  to the People and is a sure Omen of future Success and Prosperity. "
" [Philadelphia] Aug. 11, 1777","I have paid Turner, his Wages up to this day, and settled all Accounts with him. Besides which I have given him 3 : 2s : 0d. L.M. towards his  home. When he arrives he is to produce his Account to you, of the Expences of his journey. See that he produces Receipts from the Tavern Keepers. Dont pay a Farthing, but what he produces a Receipt for. I am glad he is going, for between you and me he is a very stupid, and a very intemperate Fellow, very fit for a Companion of the Man who recommended him. Yet He is honest. I never saw  knavish in him. He has had a fine Opportunity weaving Stockings to the Tune of a dollars a Day -- besides, receiving Wages and Board from me. If he has drank it all, it is his own fault. At the End of the Year, when you send Horses for me again, send some other Man. I will not have him. A low lived Fellow, playing Cards with Negroes, and behaving like a Rival with them for Wenches. I intend to write you, to  your Father or my Brother to purchase me, too other Horses. These I will sell.  "
"Aug. 11, 1777","Your kind  of July 30 . and  31 . was handed me, just now from the Post office. I have regularly received a Letter from you every Week excepting one, for a long Time past, and as regularly send a Line to you  Papers. -- My Letters are scarcely worth sending. Indeed I dont choose to indulge much Speculation, lest a Letter should miscarry, and free Sentiments upon public Affairs intercepted, from me, might do much hurt. Where the Scourge of God, and the Plague of Mankind is gone, no one can guess. An Express from  Sinnepuxent, a Place between  the Capes of Delaware and  , informs that a fleet of 100 sail was seen off that Place last Thursday. But whether this is Fishermens News like that from  Cape Ann, I know not. The Time spends and the Campaign wears away and  makes no great Figure yet. -- How many Men and Horses will he cripple by this strange Coasting Voyage of 5 Weeks. We have given N. Englandmen what they will think a  Tryumph in the Removal of Generals from the Northward and sending Gates there. I hope every Part of  New England will now exert itself, to its Utmost Efforts. Never was a more glorious Opportunity than Burgoine has given Us of destroying him, by marching down so far towards  Albany. Let  New England turn out and cutt off his Retreat. Pray continue to write me every Week. You have made me merry with the female Frolic, with the Miser. But I hope the Females will leave off their Attachment  to Coffee. I assure you, the best Families in this Place have left off in a great Measure the Use of  West India Goods. We must bring ourselves to live upon the Produce of our own Country.

","My dearest Friend I think I have sometimes observed to you in Conversation, that upon examining the Biography of illustrious Men, you will generally find some Female about them in the Relation of Mother or Wife , to whose Instigation, a great Part of their Merit is to be ascribed. You will find a curious Example of this, in the Case of Aspasia, the Wife of Pericles. She was a Woman of the greatest Beauty and the first Genius. She taught him, it is said, his refined Maxims of Policy, his lofty imperial Eloquence; nay, even composed the Speeches, on which so great a Share of his Reputation was founded. The best Men in Athens frequented her House, and brought their Wives to receive Lessons from her of Economy and right Deportment. Socrates himself was her Pupil in Eloquence and gives her the  of that funeral oration which he delivers in the Menexenus of Plato.Aristophanes indeed abuses this famous Lady but Socrates does her Honour. I wish some of our great Men had such Wives. By the Account in your last Letter, it seems the Women in  Boston begin to think themselves able to serve their Country.  What a Pity it is that our Generals in the Northern District had not Aspasias to their Wives! I believe,  have not very great Women for Wives. If they had We should suffer more from their Exertions than We do. This is our good Fortune. A Woman of good Sense would not let her Husband spend five Weeks at Sea, in the such a season of the Year. A smart Wife would have put Howe in Possession of  Philadelphia, a long Time ago. "
"Phila..Aug. 13, 1777
","My dearest Friend We have been sweltering here, for a great Number of days together, under the scalding Wrath of the Dog Star. So severe a Spell of Heat has scarcely been known these twenty Years. The Air of the City has been like the fierce Breath of an hot oven.  has been running to the Pumps all day long. There has been no finding a Place of Comfort -- the shade, and the very Entrys of Houses where they have the best Draughts of Air, have been scarcely tolerable. This season always affects me, deeply. It exhausts my Spirits, and takes away all my Strength of Mind and Body. I have never lived here in Dog days, without becoming so enfeebled, and irritated, as to be unable to sleep soundly and regularly and to be still more reduced by Night Sweats. If I can avoid these Inconveniences, this year, I shall be happy. But I have experienced something of it, already,altho not in any great Degree. When the Weather is so , the Fatigue of even holding a Pen to write a Letter, is distressing. We have no News from the Fleet since last Thursday when about 200 of them were seen off of  Synepuxent. What will our People do with ? He has put himself in the Power of the People in that Quarter, and if they do not make him repent his Folly, they will be to blame. It is a Shame that such an handfull should ravage in a Country so populous. You will see by the Papers that Manly is taken. -- What a Disappointment to Us! -- Yet We might have expected it. What rational Creatures could order two thirty Gun Frigates to cruise on the American Coast, for the Protection of Trade. They should have been ordered to some other Seas -- to  France, to , to the  Baltic, the  Mediterranean -- any where but where they were. The Ship and Men are a Loss, but We must build more. "
"Philadelphia  August 14, 1777 Thursday
","My dearest Friend  We are still parching under the fierce Heats of Dog days. It is agreed, by most People, that so long and so intense a Heat has scarcely been known. The Day before Yesterday, Dr. Ewing an eminent Philosopher as well as Mathematician, and Divine told me, the Spirit in his Glass, was at 91 in his cool Room, and from thence he concludes that it was above an hundred abroad in the Shade, because he says it is generally ten degrees lower, in his cool Room, than it is in the Shade out of Doors. Yesterday, it was at 94, abroad in the Shade. He placed his Thermometer, against a Post which had been heated by the Sun, and the Spirit arose to an 100, but removing it to another Place, and suspending it at a distance from any warm Object and the Spirit subsided and settled at 94. -- How we shall live through these Heats I dont know. If  Army is at Sea, his Men between Decks will suffer, beyond Expression. Persons, here, who have been at Sea, upon this Coast, at this Season of the Year, say, the Heat is more intollerable, on Shipboard than on Land. There is no Comfort to be had any where, and the Reflection of the Sun Rays from the Deck, are insufferable. I wish this Wiseacre may continue to coast about  an equinoctial Storm shall overtake him. Such a Thing would make fine Sport for his Fleet. The Summer is consuming, and there is not Time enough left, for accomplishing many Things. If he should land tomorrow, it would take him three Weeks to reach  Philadelphia. On the  Jersey Side of the  Delaware, is an ugly Road for him -- many Rivers, Bridges, Causeys, Morasses, by breaking up of which, a Measure which is intended, and for which Preparations are made, his Army might be obstructed, puzzled and confounded in their March. His Army cannot proceed without many Horses, , and Cannon with their Carriages, for the Passage of which he must make new Bridges and Causeys, which would consume much Time, besides that he would be exposed, to the Militia and to the regular Army. On the other side the River there are several Streams and one large River to cross -- the  Schuylkill. And We have many fine Fire ships to annoy his Fleet. It would be happy for Us if he should aim at this Place, Because it would give Us an Opportunity of exerting the whole Force of the Continent against him. The Militia of the  Jerseys,  Pensilvania,  Delaware and  Maryland, would cooperate with Washington here -- those of  N.Y. and  N. England with Gates. Writing this Letter, at Six o Clock in the Morning in my cool Chamber has thrown me into a profuse and universal sweat. "
"Philadelphia  Aug. 15, 1777
","My dearest Friend The Weather continues, as hot as ever. Upon my Word I dont know how to sustain it. Oh for a Bowl of your Punch, a Bottle of your , or something or other that is acid. I am obliged to have recourse to the Liquor of the Roman soldiers and put about a Wine Glass of Vinegar into a Pint of Water. You would laugh to see me pouring down a Pint of this Vinegar and Water at a Time, and admiring it as a great Refreshment. Nothing yet of  Army. It begins to be suspected that they are out at Pasture on  Long Island. No further Account of the Fleet as yet. No further Account from the northern Army. If the Militia dont turn out now, and drive Burgoigne to his own Place, they deserve to suffer. Half after 9 at Night. -- The Wind blows, the  gather, the lightnings Play and the Thunder rolls. You can have no adequate Idea of the joy occasioned here by such a Scaene. They call it a Gust. Dr. Franklin in his Letters on Electricity has explained the Philosophy of it. After a Continuance of Heat it seldom fails to occasion a Change of Weather. It is followed by a cooler and purer Air. The hot Weather has now continued in an extreme for two Weeks together. The People here generally agree that an Heat so intense in Degree and of so long Continuance, has scarcely ever been known. Cold Water has  Numbers. But now it rains a Torrent and thunders and lightens most delightfully. It will clean our streets, it will purge our Air. It will be cool, and comfortable after this Gust. Half after 10. -- It is now a constant,  Rain and the World is all of a Blaze with Lightning, and the grand Rolls of Thunder shake the very Chamber where I am. The Windows jarr, the shutters Clatter, and the floor trembles. "
"Philadelphia  August 17, 1777 Sunday","My dearest Friend Yesterday We had a cool Day, the Wind Easterly and cloudy, this Morning there is a brisk northeast Wind and cool Rain, which restores Us, to some Comfort. A  Number of People died here with excessive Heat, besides others, who fell Sacrifices to their own Imprudence in drinking cold Water. This Wind will oblige the Knight Errant and his Fleet, to go somewhere or other. We have had no Intelligence of it, since last Thursday week. We have a Letter from G. Schuyler, in which he  ""is not insensible of the Indignity of being call'd away, when an Action must soon take Place."" But I hope, the People will not resent this Indignity, so as not to turn out. G. [General] Gates I hope, will be able to find Men, who will stand by him. Never was there a fairer opportunity, than now presents of ruining Burgoigne. By the same Letter, We have confused Hints, that an Attack has been made upon  Fort Schuyler, and the Enemy repulsed. The Letter seems to suppose, that he had written a fuller Account of it before. -- But no such Account has reached Us. The Enemy at  Niagara and  Detroit, are endeavouring to seduce the Indians, to take up the Hatchet, but as yet, with little success. They seem determined to maintain their Neutrality. I read a Letter last Evening directed to Mr. Serjeant, and in his Absence to me from Mr. Clark a Delegate from  N. Jersey who is gone Home to  Elizabeth Town for his Health, giving a particular Account of  Army, in their late precipitate Retreat from  Westfield. They were seized with the Utmost Terror, and thrown into the Utmost Confusion. They were so weak and sickly, and had gorged themselves so with fresh Meat, that they fell down in the Roads, many died, and were half buried, &c. &c. &c. We have many new Members of Congress, among whom are Mr. Vandyke of Delaware, Mr. Jones of  Virginia, and Mr. Lawrence  of  S. Carolina. This last Gentleman is a great acquisition -- of the first Rank in his State, Lt. Governor, of ample Fortune, of great Experience, having been 20 Years in their assembly, of a clear Head and a firm Temper, of extensive Knowledge, and much Travel. He has hitherto appeared as good a Member, as any Weever had in Congress. I wish that all the States would imitate this Example and send their best Men. Vandyke is a Lawyer, and a very worthy Man, his Abilities very good and his Intensions very sincere. Mr. Jones also is a Lawyer, but has so lately come in that We have seen as yet no Exhibitions of him. "
Aug. 19. 1777 Tuesday,"My best Friend Your obliging  of the 5th. came by Yesterdays Post, and I intended to have answered it by this Mornings Post, but was delayed by many Matters, untill he gave me the slip. I am sorry that you and the People of  Boston were put to so much Trouble, but glad to hear that such Numbers determined to fly. The Prices for Carting which were demanded, were detestable. I wish your Fatigue and Anxiety may not have injured your Health. Dont be anxious, for my Safety. If  comes here I shall run away, I suppose with the rest. We are too brittle ware you know to stand the Dashing of Balls and Bombs. I wonder upon what Principle the Roman Senators refused to fly from the Gauls and determined to sit, with their Ivory Staves and hoary Beards in the Porticoes of their Houses untill the Enemy entered the City, and altho they confessed they resembled the Gods, put them to the Sword. I should not choose to indulge this sort of Dignity, but I confess I feel myself so much injured by these  barbarean Britains, that I have a strong Inclination to meet them in the Field. This is not Revenge I believe, but there is something sweet and delicious in the Contemplation of it. There is in our Hearts, an Indignation against Wrong, that is righteous and benevolent, and he who is destitute of it, is defective in the Ballance of his Affections and in his moral Character. As long as there is a Conscience in our Breasts, a moral Sense which distinguishes between Right and Wrong, approving, esteeming, loving the former, and condemning and detesting the other, We must feel a Pleasure in the Punishment, of so eminent a Contemner of all that is Right and good and just, as  is. They are virtuous and pious Passions that prompt Us to desire his Destruction, and to lament and deplore his success and Prosperity. The Desire of assisting towards his Disgrace, is an honest Wish. It is too late in Life,  my Constitution is too much debilitated by Speculation, and indeed it is too late a Period in the War, for me to think of girding on a sword: But if I had the last four Years to run over again, I certainly would. "
"Philadelphia  August 19, 1777 Tuesday
","My best Friend  The Weather still continues cloudy and cool and the Wind Easterly.  Fleet and Army is still incognito. The Gentlemen from  South Carolina, begin to tremble for  Charlestown. If  is under a judicial Blindness, he may be gone there. But what will be the Fate of a scorbutic Army cooped up in a Fleet for Six, Seven or Eight Weeks in such intemperate Weather, as We have had. What will be their Condition landing, on a burning shore abounding with Agues and , in the most unwholesome Season of the whole Year? If he should get  Charlestown, or indeed the whole State, what Progress will this make towards the Conquest of  America? He will stop the Trade of Rice and Indigo, but what then? -- Besides he will get some ugly Knocks. They are honest, sincere and brave and will make his Life uncomfortable. I feel a strong Affection for  , for several Reasons. 1. I think them as stanch Patriots as any in  America. 2. I think them as brave. 3. They are the only People in  America, who have maintained a Post and defended a Fort.  4. They have sent Us a new Delegate, whom I greatly admire,Mr. Lawrence, their Lt. Governor, a Gentleman of great Fortune, great Abilities, Modesty and Integrity -- and great Experience too. If all the States would send Us such Men, it would be a Pleasure to be here. In the Northern Department they begin to fight. The Family of Johnson, the black part of it as well as the white, are pretty well thinned. Rascals! they deserve Extermination. I presume  will be so supported that Burgoingne will be obliged to retreat. He will stop at  Ticonderoga I suppose for they can maintain Posts, altho We cannot. I think We shall never defend a Post,  We shoot a General. After that We shall defend Posts, and this Event in my Opinion is not far off. No other Fort will ever be evacuated without an Enquiry, nor any Officer come off without a Court Martial. We must trifle no more. We have suffered too many Disgraces to pass unexpiated. Every Disgrace must be wiped off. We have been several Days, hammering upon Money. We are contriving every Way We can, to redress the Evils We feel and fear, from too great a Quantity of Paper. Taxation, as deep as possible, is the only radical Cure. I hope you will pay every Tax that is brought you, if you sell my Books, or , or oxen or your Cows to pay it. "
"Philadelphia  August 20th. 1777 Wednesday
","My best Friend This Day  three Years since I stepped into the Coach, at Mr. Cushings Door, in  Boston, to go to  Philadelphia in Quest of Adventures. -- And Adventures I have found. I feel an Inclination sometimes, to write the History of the last Three Years, in Imitation of Thucidides. There is a striking Resemblance, in several Particulars, between the Peloponnesian and the American War. The real Motive to the former was a jealousy of the growing Power of  Athens, by Sea and Land . . . . The genuine Motive to the latter, was a similar Jealousy of the growing Power of  America. The true Causes which incite to War, are seldom professed, or Acknowledged. We are now afloat upon a full Sea: When We shall arrive at a safe , no Mariner has Skill and experience enough to foretell. But, by the Favour of Heaven, We shall make a prosperous Voyage, after all the Storms, and Shoals are passed. 5. o Clock afternoon It is now fair sunshine again and very warm. Not a Word, yet, from  Fleet. The most general Suspicion, now, is that it is gone to  Charlestown S.C.-- But it is a wild Supposition. It may be right however: for Howe is a wild General. We have been hammering , upon a Mode of Tryal for the General Officers at Ti. Whether an Enquiry will preceed the Court Martial, and whether the Enquiry shall be made by a Committee of Congress or by a Council of General Officers, is not determined, but Enquiry and Tryal both I conjecture there will be. If  is gone to  Charlestown, you will have a little Quiet, and enjoy your Corn and Rye and Flax and Hay, and other good Things, untill another Summer. But What shall We do for Sugar, and Wine and Rum? -- Why truly I believe We must leave them off. Loaf Sugar is only four Dollars a Pound here, and Brown only a Dollar, for the meanest sort, and Ten shillings for that a little better. Every Body here is leaving off loaf Sugar, and most are laying aside brown. As to Rum and Wine -- give me  and I would compound.  N.E. Rum is but 40s. a Gallon. But, if Wine was Ten Dollars a Bottle, I would have one Glass a Day, in Water, while the hot weather continues, unless I could get Cyder. "

","My best Friend This Morning, We have heard again from the Fleet. At 9 o Clock at Night, on the 14. Inst. upwards of an hundred Sail were seen, standing in between the Capes of  Bay. They had been seen from the Eastern shore of  Virginia, standing off, and on, for two days before. -- This Method of coasting along the shore, and standing off, and on, is very curious. First seen off  Egg Harbour, then several Times, off the  Capes of Delaware, standing in and out, then off  Sinepuxent, then off the Eastern shore of Virginia, then standing in to  Cheasapeak Bay. How many Men, and Horses, will he loose in this Sea Ramble, in the Heat of Dog days. Whether he is going to Virginia to steal Tobacco, to  N. Carolina to pilfer Pitch and Tar, or to South to plunder Rice and Indigo, who can tell? He will seduce a few Negroes from their Masters let him go to which he will. But is this conquering  America? From the Northward We learn that Arnold has marched with about 2000 Men to the Relief of  Fort Schuyler. Our People have given Sir John Johnson and his Regulars, Tories and Indians, a very fine Drubbing. The Indians scarcely ever had such a Mauling. The Devils are so frightened that they are all run away to howl and mourn. The Papers,  with this, will give you, more particular Information. -- Can nothing be done at  Rhode Island at this critical Time.  -- Opprobrium Novangliae! What is become of all the  Massachusetts continental Troops. Every Regiment and every Man of them is at the Northward, under  and yet We are told they have not 4000 Men fit for Duty Officers included. And there are 3 Regiments there from  N. Hampshire too. 10 o Clock at Night Just come in from Congress. We have within this Hour, received Letters of G. Schuyler and Lincoln, giving an Account of the Battle of  Bennington, wherein Gen. Starks has acquired great Glory, and so has his Militia. The Particulars are to be out in an Hand Bill, tomorrow Morning. I will inclose you one. "
"Philadelphia  August 23 1777
","My best Friend It is now no longer a Secret, where  Fleet is. We have authentic Intelligence that it is arrived, at the Head of  Cheasopeak Bay, above the  River Petapsco upon which the Town of  Baltimore stands. I wish I could describe to you the Geography of this Country, so as to give you an Adequate Idea of the Situation of the two great  Bays of  and Delaware, because it would enable you to form a Conjecture, concerning the Object, he aims at. -- The Distance across Land from the Heads of these Bays is but small, and forms an Istmus, below which is a large Peninsula comprehending the  Counties of Accomack and Northampton in  Virginia, the  Counties of Somersett and Worcester in  Maryland, and the  Counties of Kent and Sussex on Delaware. His March by Land to  Philadelphia, may be about sixty or seventy Miles. I think there can be no doubt that he aims at this Place, and he has taken this Voyage of six Weeks, long enough to have gone to  London, merely to avoid an Army in his Rear.  He found he could not march this Way from Somersett Court House, without leaving G. Washington in his Rear. We have called out the Militia of  Virginia,  Maryland,  Delaware, and , to oppose him, and G. Washington is handy enough, to meet him, and as G. Washington saved  Philadelphia last Winter, by crossing the  Delaware and marching to  Morristown, and so getting in the Rear of Howe, so I conjecture he will still find Means to get in his Rear between him and  Cheasapeak Bay. You may now sit under your own Vine, and have none to make you afraid. -- I sent off my Man and Horse at an unlucky Time, but, if We should be obliged to remove from hence, We shall not go far. If Congress had deliberated and debated a Month they could not have concerted a Plan for  more to our Advantage than that which he has adopted. He gives Us an Opportunity of exerting the Strength of all the middle States against him, while  N.Y. and  N.E. are destroying Burgoine. Now is the Time, never was so good an Opportunity, for my Countrymen to turn out and crush that vapouring, blustering Bully to Attoms. "
Philadelphia  August 23d. [1777] Saturday 4 O Clock,"My best Friend We have an Express, today from Governor Johnson,  Nicholson and several other Gentlemen with an Account that the Fleet, to the Number of Two hundred and Sixty Three Sail, have gone up towards the Head of  Cheasapeak Bay. They lie over against the Shore between the  River Sassafras and the  River Elke. We have also a Letter from  acquainting Us that Tommorrow Morning at seven O Clock, he shall march his Army through the City of Philadelphia, along Front Street, and then turn up Chesnutt Street, in his Way to cross over the Bridge at  Schuylkill River, so that General How will have a grand Continental Army, to oppose him, in very good Season, aided by a formidable Collection of Militia. I like this Movement of the General, through  the City, because, such a show of Artillery, Waggons, Light Horse and Infantry, which takes up a Line of 9 or 10 Miles upon their March and will not be less than 5 or 6 Hours passing through the Town, will make a good Impression upon the Minds of the timourous Whiggs for their Confirmation, upon the cunning Quakers for their Restraint and upon the rascally Tories for their Confusion. I think there is a reasonable Ground for Confidence with the  of Heaven that How will not be able to reach this City. -- Yet I really doubt whether it would not be more for our Interest that he should come here and get Possession of the Town. 1. Because there are Impurities here which will never be so soon or so fully purged away, as by that Fire of Affliction which  inkindles wherever he goes. 2. Because it would employ nearly the whole of his Force to keep Possession of this Town, and the rest of the Continent would be more at Liberty. 3. We could counteract him here better than in many other Places. 4. He would leave  N. England and  N.Y. at Leisure to kill or catch . In all Events I think you may rejoice and sing, for the season is so far gone, that he cannot remove to you. "
"Philadelphia  August 24, 1777
","My dearest Friend We had last Evening a Thunder Gust, very sharp and violent, attended with  Rain. The Lightning struck in several Places. It struck the Quaker Alms House in Walnut Street, between third and fourth Streets, not far from Captn. Duncans, where I lodge. They had been wise enough to place an Iron Rod upon the Top of the Steeple, for a Vane to turn on, and had provided no Conductor to the Ground. It also struck in fourth Street, near Mrs. Cheesmans. No Person was hurt. This Morning was fair, but now it is overcast and rains very hard which will spoil our Show, and  the Army. 12 O Clock. The Rain ceased and the Army marched through the Town, between Seven and Ten O Clock. The  went another Road. Four Regiments of Light Horse -- Blands, Bailers  [Baylor's], Sheldons, and Moylands  [Moylan's]. Four Grand Divisions of the Armyand the Artillery with the Matrosses. They marched Twelve deep, and yet took up above two Hours in passing by.  and the other General Officers, with their Aids on Horse back. The Colonels and other Field Officers on Horse back. We have now an Army, well appointed between Us and , and this Army will be immediately joined, by ten Thousand Militia. So that I feel as secure here, as if I was at  Braintree, but not so happy. My Happiness is no where to be found, but there. After viewing this fine Spectacle and firm  I went to Mr. Duffields Meeting, to hear him pray, as he did most fervently, and I believe he was very sincerely joined by all present, for its success. The Army, upon an accurate Inspection of it, I find to be  well armed, pretty well cloathed, and tolerably disciplined.EdesGill and Town by the Mottoes to their Newspapers, will bring Discipline into Vogue, in Time. -- There is such a Mixture of the Sublime, and the Beautifull, together with the Usefull, in military Discipline, that I wonder, every Officer We have is not charmed with it. -- Much remains yet to be done. Our soldiers have not yet, quite the Air of Soldiers. They dont step exactly in Time. They dont hold up their Heads, quite erect, nor turn out their Toes, so exactly as they ought. They dont all of them cock their Hats -- and such as do, dont all wear them the same Way. A Disciplinarian has affixed to him commonly the Ideas of Cruelty, severity, Tyranny &c. But if I were an Officer I am convinced I should be the most decisive Disciplinarian in the Army. I am convinced their is no other effectual Way of indulging Benevolence, Humanity, and the tender Social Passions, in an Army. There is no other Way of preserving the Health and Spirits of the Men. There is no other Way of making them active, and , in War -- no other Method of guarding an Army against Destruction by surprizes, and no other Method of giving them Confidence in one another, or making them stand by one another, in the Hour of Battle. Discipline in an Army, is like the Laws, in civil Society. There can be no Liberty, in a Commonwealth, where the Laws are not revered, and most sacredly observed, nor can there be Happiness or Safety in an Army, for a single Hour, where the Discipline is not observed. Obedience is the only Thing wanting now for our Salvation -- Obedience to the Laws, in the States, and Obedience to Officers, in the Army. 12 O Clock. No Express, nor accidental News from  Maryland , as yet. "
"Phila.  Aug. 25. 1777
","Yours of Aug. 12 and 13 , came by this Mornings Post. A letter from   Bay, dated Yesterday Morning, informs that the Enemy had not then landed . This Morning General Nash, with his Brigade of North Carolina Forces, marched  the Town with their Band of Musick, their Train of Artillery, and their Bagage Waggons, their Bread Waggons, travelling Forges &c.  Army encamped last Night at Derby. Sullivans Division is expected along in two days. Our Intelligence of the Fleet has been as good as could be expected -- they have been 6 Weeks at sea. If our People do not now turn out and destroy  Gang root and branch, they may justly be reproached as lost to Honour and to Virtue. He is compleatly in our Power.

","My best Friend  Army, at least about 5000 of them besides his Light Horse, are landed, upon the  Banks of the Elke River, and the Disposition he has made of his Forces, indicate a Design to rest and refresh both Men and Horses.  and he was at  Wilmington last Night, and his Army is there to day. The Militia are turning out with great Alacrity both in  Maryland and  Pensilvania. They are distressed for Want of Arms. Many have none -- others have only little fowling Pieces. However, We shall rake and scrape enough to do Howes Business, by the favour of Heaven.  must have intended that  Washington should have sent his Army up to fight Burgoine. But He is disappointed. The Kindness of Heaven, towards Us, has in nothing appeared more conspicuous, than in this Motion of . If the Infatuation is not so universal as to seize Americans, as well as him, it will prove the certain Destruction of Burgoines Army.  The  New England Troops and  N. York Troops are every Man of them at  Peeks Kill and with . The Massachusetts Regiments are all with Gates.  has none but Southern Troops with him, and he has much the largest Army to encounter. If My Countrymen do not now turn out and do something, I shall be disappointed indeed. One fifth Part of  Force has been totally destroyed by Starks and Herkermer. The Remainder must be shocked and terrified at the Stroke. Now is the Time to strike. -- New Englandmen! strike home. "
"Philadelphia  August 29. 1777 Fryday
","My dearest Friend The Newspapers enclosed, will give you, all the Intelligence, of any Consequence.  with a very numerous Army, is between  Wilmington and the Head of Elke. How will make but a pitifull Figure. The Militia of four States, are turning out, with much Alacrity, and chearfull Spirits. The Continental Army, under Washington, Sullivan and Nash, besides is in my Opinion more numerous, by several Thousands, than Howes whole Force. I am afraid that He will be frightened and run on board his ships and go away, plundering, to some other Place. I almost wish he had  Philadelphia, for then he could not get away. I really think it would be the best Policy to retreat before him, and let him into this Snare, where his Army must be ruined. -- However this Policy will not be adopted. In a Letter from good Authority, Mr. Paca, we are informed that many dead Horses have been driven on the Eastern shore of  Maryland. -- Horses thrown overboard, from the Fleet, no doubt. Price current. 4 a Week for Board, besides finding your own Washing, shaving, Candles, Liquors, Pipes, Tobacco, Wood &c. Thirty shillings a Week for a servant. It ought to be 30s. for the Gentleman and 4 for the servant, because he generally eats twice as much and makes twice as much trouble. Shoes five Dollars a Pair. Salt, 27 dollars a . Butter 10s. a Pound. Punch twenty shillings a Bowl. All the old Women  are young Children are gone down to  the Jersey shore to make Salt. Salt Water is boiling all round the Coast, and I hope it will increase. For it is nothing but heedlessness, and shiftlessness that prevents Us from making Salt enough for a Supply. But Necessity will bring Us to it. As to sugar, Molasses, Rum &c. We must leave them off. Whisky is used here instead of Rum, and I dont see but it is just as good. Of this, the Wheat and Rye Countries can easily distill enough, for the Use of the Country. If I could get , I would be content. The Business of the Continent has been in so critical and dangerous a situation for the last 12 Months, that it was necessary the  Massachusetts should have a full Representation, but the  of living are grown so enormous, that I believe it will be necessary to reduce the Number of Delegates to three after this Campaign is over. "
"Philadelphia  August 30th: 1777 Saturday
","My Friend A Letter from , was received last Night by the President, which I read. It is dated the 29th. Yesterday. The Enemy are in Possession of  the Head of Elke, a little Town, at the  Head of the River Elke, in which they found a Quantity of Corn and Oats, belonging to the States.  were so universally taken up, in conveying away the valuable Effects of the Inhabitants, that none could be procured to transport this Grain. Part of their Army, is advanced to Grays Hill about two Miles from the Head of Elke, but whether to take Post there, or only to cover while they remove their Plunder, from  the Head of Elke is uncertain. Our Army is at  Wilmington. We have many Officers out reconnoitring the Country and the Enemy. Our Scouting Parties have taken between Thirty and Forty Prisoners, and Twelve Deserters are come in from the Fleet and Eight from the Army. They say the Men are generally healthy, but their Horses have suffered much by the Voyage. These Prisoners and Deserters are unable to give any other Intelligence. The Enemy give out, that they are Eighteen Thousand strong. But these are like Burgoines ""Make Believes"" and ""Insinuations."" We know better; and that they have not Ten Thousands. The Militia from four States are joining , in large Numbers. The Plan of their military Operations, this Campaign, is well calculated for our Advantage. I hope We shall have heads and Hearts to improve it. For my own Part, I feel a secret Wish, that they might get into this City, because I think it more for our Interest that they should be cooped up here than that they should run away again to  N. York. But according to present Appearances they will not be able to get here. By going into   Bay, they have betrayed a Dread of the Fire Works in  the River Delaware, which indeed are formidable.They must make the most of their Time, for, They cannot rationally depend upon so fine a Season, late in the fall, and Early in Winter, as they had the last Year. September, October, and November are all that remain. We expect Hourly, Advices from  and Arnold. We have Rumours of an Expedition to  Long Island under Parsons, and another to  Staten Island, under Sullivan, but no regular Accounts. I suppose it certain that such Expeditions have been made, but know not the success. "
"Philadelphia  September 1, 1777. Monday
","My dear We have now run through the Summer, and  the Weather is still warm, the fiercest of the Heats is over. And altho the extream temperance of the late Season has weakened and exhausted me, much, yet I think upon the whole I have got thro it, as well as upon any former Occasion. A Letter from , dated Saturday, informs that our light Parties have brought in four and twenty Prisoners, more. So that the Prisoners and Deserters, since Mr. Howe landed is near an hundred. The Question now is, whether there will be a general Engagement? In the first Place I think, after all that has past it is not good Policy for Us to attack them unless We can get a  Advantage of them, in the Situation of the Ground, or an Opportunity to attack a Detachment of their Army, with superiour Numbers. It would be prudent, perhaps for Us, with our whole Force to attack them with theirs. But another Question arises, whether  will not be able compell Us to a General Engagement? -- Perhaps he may: but I make a Question of it:Washington will maneuvre it with him, a good deal to avoid it.  A General Engagement, in which Howe should be defeated, would be ruin to him. If We should be defeated, his Army would be crippled, and perhaps, We might suddenly reinforce our Army which he could not. However all that he could gain by a Victory would be the Possession of this Town which would be the worst Situation he could be in, because it would employ his whole Force by Sea and Land to keep it, and the Command of the River. Their principal Dependence is not upon their Arms, I believe so much, as upon the Failure of our Revenue. They think, they have taken such Measures, by circulating Counterfeit Bills, to depreciate the Currency, that it cannot hold its Credit longer than this Campaign. But they are mistaken. We however must disappoint them, by renouncing all Luxuries, and by a severe economy.  setts a fine Example. He has banished Wine from his Table and entertains his Friends with Rum and Water. This is much to the Honour of his Wisdom, his Policy, and his Patriotism, and the Example must be followed, by banishing sugar, and all imported Articles, from all our Families. If Necessity should reduce Us to a Simplicity of Dress, and Diet, becoming Republicans, it would be an happy and a glorious Necessity. "

","My dear Friend I had Yesterday the Pleasure of yours of  from  Boston, and am happy to find that you have been able to do so well, amidst all your Difficulties. -- There is but one Course for Us to take and that is to renounce the Use of all foreign Commodities. For my own Part I never lived in my whole Life, so meanly and poorly as I do now, and yet my Constituents will growl at my Extravagance. Happy should I be indeed if I could share with you, in the Produce of your little Farm. Milk and Apples and Pork and Beef, and the Fruits of the Garden would be Luxury to me. We had nothing Yesterday from the General. --  Army are in a very unwholesome Situation. Their Water is very bad and brackish, there are frequent Morning and Evening Fogs, which produce Intermittent Fevers in Abundance. --Washington has a great Body of Militia assembled and assembling, in Addition to a grand Continental Army. Whether he will strike or not, I cant say. He is very prudent, you know, and will not unnecessarily hazard his Army. By my own inward Feelings, I judge, I should put more to risque if I were in his shoes. But perhaps he is right.  has proved, that it is possible to hold a Post.Harkermer  [Herkimer] has shewn that it is possible to fight Indians, and Stark has proved that it is practicable, even to attack Lines and Posts, with Militia. -- I wish the Continental Army would prove, that any Thing can be done. But this is sedition at least. I am weary however, I own, with so much Insipidity. St. Ledger  and his Party have run away. So will Burgoine. I wish Stark had the Supream Command in the Northern Department. I am sick of Fabian Systems in all Quarters. The Officers drink a long and moderate War. My Toast is a short and violent War. They would call me mad and rash &c. but I know better. I am as cool as any of them and cooler too, for my Mind is not inflamed with Fear nor Anger, whereas I believe theirs are with both. -- If this Letter should be intercepted and published, it would do as much good, as another did two Years ago. "
"Philadelphia  Monday Septr. 8. 1777
","My dear There has been a very general Apprehension, during the last Week that a general Action would happen, as on Yesterday. But We hear of none. Our Army is  between  Newport and  White-Clay Creek on advantageous Ground. The General has harrangued his Army and published in General orders, in order to prepare their Minds for something great, and has held up the Example of Starks, Harkemer, Gansevoort and their Troops, to animate his Officers and Men with Emulation. -- Whether he expects to be attacked, or whether he designs to offend, I cant say. A General Action which should terminate in a Defeat of  would be compleat and final Ruin to him, if it should terminate only in a drawn Battle, it would be the same Thing. If He should gain a Victory, and maintain Possession of the Field, he would loose so many Men killed and wounded, that he would scarcely have enough left to march to Philadelphia, surrounded as he would be with Militia, and the broken remains of the Continental Army. But if there should be no general Battle, and the two Armies should lounge away the Remainder of the , in silent Inactivity gazing at each other, Howes Reputation would be ruined in his own Country and in all  Europe, and the Dread  of him would cease in all America. The American mind, which I think has more Firmness now than it ever had before since this War begun, would acquire a Confidence and Strength, that all the Efforts of  Great Britain afterwards would not be able to relax. You will see by the Papers , that We have been obliged to attempt to humble the Pride of some Jesuits who call themselves Quakers, but who love Money and Land better than Liberty or Religion. The Hypocrites are endeavouring to raise the Cry of Persecution, and to give this Matter a religious Turn, but they cant succeed. The World knows them and their Communications. Actuated by a land jobbing Spirit, like that of William Penn, they have been soliciting Grants of immense Regions of Land on the  Ohio. American Independence has disappointed them, which makes them hate it. Yet the Dastards dare not avow their Hatred to it, it seems. The Moments are critical here. We know not, but the next, will bring Us an Account of a general Engagement begun -- and when once begun We know not how it will end, for the Battle is not always to the strong. The Events of War are uncertain. All that We can do is to pray, as I do most devoutly, that We may be victorious -- at least that We may not be vanquished. But if it should be the Will of Heaven that our Army should be defeated, our Artillery lost, our best Generals , and  Philadelphia fall into Mr. Howes Hands, still  America is not conquered. America would yet be possessed of great Resources, and capable of great Exertions. As Mankind would see. -- It may for what I know be the Design of Providence that this should be the Case. Because it would only lay the Foundations of American Independence deeper, and cement them stronger. It would cure Americans of their vicious and luxurious and effeminate Appetites, Passions and  [illegible]   Habits, an a more dangerous Army to American Liberty than Mr. Howes. However, without the Loss of  Philadelphia, We must be brought to an entire Renunciation of foreign Commodities, at least of  West India produce. People are coming to this Resolution, very fast here. Loaf sugar at four dollars a Pound, Wine at Three Dollars a Bottle, &c. will soon introduce Economy in the Use of these Articles. This Spirit of Economy would be more terrible to  Great Britain, than  else -- and it would make Us more respectable in the Eyes of all Europe. Instead of acrimonious Altercations between Town and Country and between Farmer and Merchant, I wish, that my dear Countrymen would agree in this Virtuous Resolution, of depending on themselves alone. Let them make salt, and live without sugar -- and Rum. I am grieved to hear of the Angry Contentions among you. That improvident Act, for limiting Prices, has done great Injury, and in my sincere Opinion if not repealed, will ruin the state, and introduce a civil War. -- I know not how unpopular, this sentiment may be: but it is sincerely mine. -- There are Rascally Upstarts in Trade I doubt not, who have made great Fortunes in a small Period, who are Monopolizing, and oppressing. But how this can be avoided entirely I know not, but by  their Goods and letting them perish in their Hands. "

If We should move it will be to Reading,  Lancaster,  York,  Easton or  Bethlehem, some Town in this state. It is the Determination not to leave this state.

","My best Friend It is now a long Time, since I had an Opportunity of writing to you, and I fear you have suffered unnecessary Anxiety on my Account. -- In the Morning of the 19th. Inst., the Congress were , in their Beds, by a Letter from Mr. Hamilton one of General Washingtons Family, that the Enemy were in Possession of the Ford over the  Schuylkill, and the Boats, so that they had it in their Power to be in  Philadelphia, before Morning. The Papers of Congress, belonging to the Secretary's Office, the War Office, the Treasury Office, &c. were before sent to  Bristol. The President, and all the other Gentlemen were gone that Road, so I followed, with my Friend Mr. Merchant  [Marchant] of  Rhode Island, to Trenton in the jersies. We stayed at  Trenton, untill the 21. when We set off, to  Easton upon the  Forks of Delaware. From  Easton We went to  Bethlehem, from thence to Reading, from thence to  Lancaster, and from thence to this Town, which is about a dozen Miles over the  Susquehannah River. -- Here Congress is to sit. In order to convey the Papers, with safety, which are of more Importance than all the Members, We were induced to take this Circuit, which is near 180 Miles, whereas this Town by the directest Road is not more than 88 Miles from Philadelphia. This Tour has given me an Opportunity of seeing many Parts of this Country, which I never saw before. This Morning  arrived here with a large Packett from General Gates, containing very agreable Intelligence, which I need not repeat, as you have much earlier Intelligence from that Part than We have. I wish Affairs here wore as pleasing an Aspect. -- But  they do not. I shall avoid every Thing like History, and make no Reflections. However, General Washington is in a Condition tolerably respectable, and the Militia are now turning out, from  Virginia,  Maryland and  , in small Numbers. All the Apology that can be made, for this Part of the World is that Mr. Howes march from  Elke to  Philadelphia, was thro the very Regions of Passive obedience. The whole Country thro which he passed, is inhabited by Quakers. There is not such another Body of Quakers in all  America, perhaps not in all the World. I am still of Opinion that  Philadelphia will be no Loss to Us. I am very comfortably situated, here, in the House of , whose Hospitality has taken in Mr. S. [Samuel ]A. [Adams] , Mr.  [Gerry] and me. My Health is as good as common, and I assure you my Spirits not the worse for the Loss of Philadelphia. Biddle in the Continental Frigate at  S.

","My best Friend This Town is a small one, not larger than  Plymouth. -- There are in it, two German Churches, the one Lutheran, the other Calvinistical. The Congregations are pretty numerous, and their Attendance upon public Worship is decent. It is remarkable that the Germans, wherever they are found, are  to maintain the public Worship, which is more than can be said of the other Denominations of Christians, this Way. There is one Church here erected by the joint Contributions of Episcopalians and Presbyterians, but the Minister, who is a Missionary, is confined for Toryism, so that they have had for a long Time no publick Worship .... Congress have appointed two Chaplains, Mr. White and Mr. Duffield, the former of whom an Episcopalian is arrived and opens Congress with Prayers every Day. The latter is expected every Hour. Mr. Duche I am sorry to inform you has turned out an Apostate and a Traytor. Poor Man!  I pitty his Weakness, and detest his Wickedness. As to News, We are yet in a  Suspense about Affairs at the Northward, but from  Philadelphia, We have Accounts that are very pleasing. Commodore Hazelwood, with his Gallies, and Lt. Coll.Smith in the Garrison of  Fort Mifflin, have behaved in a manner the most gallant and glorious. They have defended the River, and the Fort with a Firmness and Perseverance, which does Honour to human Nature. If the News from the Northward is true,  will scarcely venture upon Winter Quarters in  Philadelphia. We are waiting, for News, from  Rhode Island. I am wearied with the Life I lead, and long for the joys of my Family. God grant I may enjoy it, in Peace. Peace is my dear Delight. War has no Charms for me. -- If I live much longer in Banishment I shall scarcely know my own Children. Tell my little ones, that if they will be very good, Pappa will come home. "

","My dearest Friend Mr. Colman goes off for  Boston Tomorrow. I have seized a Moment, to congratulate you on the great and glorious Success of our Arms at the Northward, and in  Delaware River. The Forts at Province Island and  Red Bank have been defended, with a Magnanimity, which will give our Country a Reputation in  Europe.  repulsed the Enemy from  Red bank and took Count Donop and his Aid Prisoners. Coll. Smith repulsed a bold Attack upon  Fort Mifflin, and our Gallies disabled two Men of War a 64 and 20 Gun ship in such a Manner, that the Enemy blew them up. This comes confirmed this Evening, in Letters from Gen. Washington enclosing Original Letters from Officers in the Forts. Congress will appoint a Thanksgiving, and one Cause of it ought to be that the Glory of turning the Tide of Arms, is not immediately due to the Commander in Chief, nor to southern Troops. If it had been, Idolatry, and Adulation would have been unbounded, so excessive as to endanger our Liberties for what I know. Now We can allow a certain Citizen to be wise, virtuous, and good, without thinking him a Deity or a saviour. "
"York Town,  Octr. 28. 1777
","My dearest Friend We have been three days, soaking and poaching in the  Rain, that has been known for several Years, and what adds to the Gloom is the Uncertainty in which We remain to this Moment, concerning the Fate of Gates and Burgoigne. -- We are out of Patience. It is impossible to bear this suspence, with any Temper. I am in comfortable Lodgings, which is a Felicity that has fallen to the Lott of a very few of our Members. Yet the House where I am is so thronged, that I cannot enjoy such Accommodations as I wish. I cannot have a Room as I used, and therefore cannot find Opportunities to write as I once did. The People of this Country, are chiefly Germans, who have Schools in their own Language, as well as Prayers, Psalms and Sermons, so that Multitudes are born, grow up and die here, without ever learning the English. -- In  they are a Breed of Mongrels or Neutrals, and benumbed with a general Torpor. If the People, in  ,  Maryland,  Delaware and  Jersy had the Feelings and the Spirit of some People that I know, Howe would be soon ensnared in a Trap, more fatal than that in which, as it is said, Burgoigne was taken.  is compleatly in our Power, and if he is not totally ruined it will be entirely owing to the Aukwardness and Indolence of this Country. Fighting however, begins to become fashionable.  Green has exhibited a glorious Example, in the Defence of  Red bank. But this must be done by a New Englandman at the Head of two  N. England Regiments, Rhode Islanders.  Smith however, is a Marylander, from Baltimore. He has shewn another Example of Magnanimity, which gives me the most agreable Hopes. Commodore Hazelwood too, has behaved in a manner that exceeds all Praise. This Spirit will be caught by other Officers, for Bravery is epidemical and contagious as the Plague. This Army suffers much for Want of  and Shoes. I celebrated the 25th. of this Month, in my own Mind and Heart, much more than I shall the 30th. -- because I think the first a more fortunate day than the last.  My Duty to your Father and my Mother -- to  and Aunts. Love to Brothers and sisters -- but above all, present all the Affection that Words can express to our dear Babes. "

The News on the other Side, is from a Merchant to his Partner.   I am in great Haste, most affectionately yours. Business still continues dull but am in Hopes of a Speedy Change as it seems by the last Accounts from  Amsterdam that a War with  France and  England is inevitable. Lord Stormont, the English Ambassador has left the  Court of France, upon meeting with an unsatisfactory Answer relative to the French's supporting the Americans which they and the Spaniards are determined to do. And you may soon expect to see a Number of  from his Christian and Catholick Majestyes Dominions in America with every necessary Supply for carrying on the War, and the King of Prussia has opened the  Port of Mendin for the Americans to carry their Prizes in and to trade. Stocks fell in  England 15 Pr. Ct. upon the Ambassadors leaving the french Court. I hope a french War may break out as it will be the Means of our making great Fortunes which I should be happy to acquaint you with. "

Portsmouth Decr. 15. 1777,"My dear I arrived here, last Evening, in good Health. This Morning,  made me a Visit, at the Tavern, Tiltons, and insists upon my taking a Bed at his House, in so very affectionate, and urgent a Manner, that I believe I shall go to his House. The Cause comes on Tomorrow, before my old Friend Dr. Joshua Brackett, as judge of Admiralty. How it will go I know not. The Captors are a numerous Company, and are said to be very tenacious, and have many Connections; so that We have Prejudice, and Influence to fear: Justice, Policy and Law, are, I am very sure, on our Side. I have had many Opportunities, in the Course of this journey, to observe, how deeply rooted, our righteous Cause is in the Minds of the People -- and could write you many Anecdotes in Proof of it. But I will reserve them for private Conversation. But on ad Thoughts why should I? One Evening, as I  in one Room, I overheard Company of the Common sort of People in another, conversing upon serious subjects. One of them, whom I afterwards found upon Enquiry to be a reputable, religious Man, was more eloquent than the rest-he was upon the Danger of despizing and neglecting serious Things. Said whatever Person or People made light of them would soon find themselves terribly mistaken. At length I heard these Words --  ""it appears to me the eternal son of God is opperating Powerfully against the British Nation for their treating lightly serious Things."" One Morning, I asked my Landlady what I had to pay? Nothing she said --  ""I was welcome, and she hoped I would always make her House my Home, and she should be happy to entertain all those Gentlemen who had been raised up by Providence to be the Saviours of their Country."" This was flattering enough to my vain Heart. But it made a greater Impression on me, as a Proof, how deeply this Cause had sunk into the Minds and Hearts of the People. -- In short every Thing I see and hear, indicates the same Thing.  "

","My dearest Friend I am so sensible of the Difficulty of conveying Letters safe, to you, at I am afraid to write, any Thing more than to tell you that after the Fatigues and Dangers of my Voyage, and Journey, I am here in Health... The Reception I have met, in this Kingdom, has been as friendly, polite, and as  as was possible. It is the universal Opinion the People here, of all Ranks, that a Friendship between  France and  America, is the Interest of both Countries, and the late Alliance, happily formed, is universally popular: so much so that I have been told by Persons of good judgment, that the Government here, would have been under a Sort of Necessity of agreeing to it even if it had of been agreable to themselves. The Delights of  France are innumerable. The Politeness, the Elegance, the Softness, the Delicacy, is extreme. In short stern and hauty Republican as I am, I cannot help loving; these People, for their earnest Desire, and Assiduity to please. It would be futile to attempt Descriptions of this Country especially of  Paris and  Versailles. The public Buildings and Gardens, the Paintings, Sculpture, Architecture, , &c. of these Cities have already filled many Volumes. The Richness, the Magnificence, and Splendor, is beyond all Description. This Magnificence is not confined to public Buildings such as Churches, Hospitals, Schools &c., but extends to private Houses, to Furniture, Equipage, Dress, and especially to Entertainments. -- But what is all this to me? I receive but little Pleasure in beholding all these Things, because I cannot but consider them as Bagatelles, introduced, by Time and Luxury in Exchange for the great Qualities and hardy manly Virtues of the human Heart. I cannot help suspecting that the more Elegance, the less Virtue in all Times and Countries. -- Yet I fear that even my own dear Country wants the Power and Opportunity more than the Inclination, to be elegant, soft, and luxurious. All the Luxury I desire in this World is the Company of my dearest Friend, and my Children, , which I have sanguine Hopes, I shall, after a few Years enjoy in Peace. --  I am with inexpressible Affection Yours, yours, "

I never felt myself under so much Embarrassment in Writing because there never was so much Danger of my Letters falling into British Hands. I am pleasantly situated at  Passi, a fine airy, salubrious Situation, in the same House with Dr. Franklin, with whom I make one Family. The Dr. is in fine Health and great Reputation. Long before this Reaches you, the News will have arrived of the Treaty between this  Kingdom and  America, a great Event indeed in our History, which cannot fail to have the most important and decisive Effects. The Trade between the two Countries will vastly increase and the Security of it, will make it more profitable. My dear  is well fixed in a school, and his Behaviour does Honour to his Mamma. My Love to my dear Daughter, and my dear sons at home. "

","My dearest Friend Monsieur Chaumont has just informed me of a  bound to  Boston: but I am reduced to such a Moment of Time, that I can only inform you that I am well, and inclose a few Lines from Johnny, to let you know that he is so. I have ordered the Things you desired, to be sent you, but I will not yet say by what Conveyance, for fear of Accidents. If human Nature could be made happy by any Thing that can please the Eye, the Ear, the Taste or any other sense, or Passion or Fancy, this Country would be the Region for Happiness: -- But, if my Country were at Peace, I should be happier, among the Rocks and shades of  Pens hill: and would  chearfully exchange, all the Elegance, Magnificence and sublimity of  Europe, for the  Simplicity of  Braintree and  Weymouth. To tell you the Truth, I admire the Ladies here. Dont be jealous. They are handsome, and very well educated. Their Accomplishments are exceedingly brilliant. And their Knowledge of Letters and Arts, exceeds that of the English Ladies much, I believe. Tell  that I shall write her a Letter, as she desired, and let her know some of my Reflections in this Country. My  enjoys a Priviledge here, that is much to be envyd.

","My dearest Friend On the 13 of  I left you. It is now the 3d. of June, and I have not received a Line, nor heard a Word, directly nor indirectly, concerning you since my departure. This is a Situation of Mind, in which I never was before, and I assure you I feel a great deal of Anxiety at it: yet I do not wonder at it, because I suppose few Vessels have sailed from  Boston since ours. I have shipped for you, the Articles you requested, and the black Cloth for your Father, to whom present my most affectionate and dutiful Respects. , if he should not be unlucky, will give you an Account of your Things. It would be endless to attempt a Description of this Country. It is one great Garden. Nature and Art have conspired to render every Thing here delightful. Religion and Government, you will say ought to be excepted. -- With all my Heart. -- But these are no Afflictions to me, because I have well fixed it in my Mind as a Principle, that every Nation has a Right to that Religion and Government, which it chooses, and as long as any People please themselves in these great Points, I am determined they shall not displease me. There is so much danger that my Letter may fall into malicious Hands, that I should not choose to be too free in my Observations upon the Customs and Manners of this People. But thus much I may say with Truth and without , that there is no People in the World, who take so much Pains to please, nor any whose Endeavours in this Way, have more success. Their Arts, Manners, Taste and Language are more respected in  Europe than those of any other Nation. Luxury, dissipation, and Effeminacy, are pretty nearly at the same degree of Excess here, and in every other Part of Europe. The great Cardinal Virtue of Temperance, however, I believe flourishes here more than in any other Part of Europe. My dear Country men! how shall I  you, to avoid the Plague of  Europe? Luxury has as many and as bewitching Charms, on your Side of the Ocean as on this-and Luxury, wherever she goes, effaces from human Nature the Image of the Divinity. If I had Power I would forever banish and exclude from America, all Gold, silver, precious stones, Alabaster, Marble, Silk, Velvet and Lace. Oh the Tyrant! the American Ladies would say! What! -- Ay, my dear Girls, these Passions of yours, which are so easily , and others of my own sex which are exactly like them, have done and will do the Work of Tyrants in all Ages. Tyrants different from me, whose Power has banished, not Gold indeed, but other Things of greater Value, Wisdom, Virtue and Liberty.  My Son and Servant are well.

He is a promising Youth, and will tell you all the News, both in  England and  France. --  Germany seems at the Eve of War. The Emperor and King of Prussia are at the Head of Armies, and on Tiptoe to strike the Blow. England seems to be lost in a Stupor. Byrons Fleet is not yet sailed. D'Estaings passed the  Straights of Gibraltar the 16 May. We long to hear from  America, the Ratification of the Treaty with  France, the captivity of  Clintons Army, and of Lord Howes Fleet.-John is very well, at School. Stevens is also well, and behaves well. My Love to all my little ones. I want a few Pamphlets here -- the Thoughts on Government, the New York Constitution, an Essay of a Constitution of Government for Pensilvania, said to have been written by Mr. Dickinson. -- Look them up, and send them. I cannot learn, that any Reinforcement is to be sent to  America, this Summer. They can spare none. They are in a Panic, from an Apprehension of an Invasion.

I have written to you, several Times, as often as I could, and hope they will arrive. I have put on board one ship, all the Articles in your Minute. By  I have sent you a smal Present of Tea. By Captain Barnes, I will send some  [illegible]   few Things. You  how you shall pay Taxes? -- I will tell you. -- ask the favour of your Uncle Smith or Some other Friend to let you have Silver, and draw your Bills upon me. The Money shall be paid, in the instant of the sight of your Bill, but let it be drawn in your own Hand Writing. Any body who wants to remit Cash to  France,  Spain,  Holland or  England, will let you have the Money. You may draw with Confidence, for the Cash shall be paid here. I suppose however, that one hundred Pounds, a Year, sterling will be as much as you will have Occasion for. With silver, you may get your Father, or  your Uncle  or Brother Cranch to pay your Taxes. You have made  very happy by your Letter to him-he is writing a long Answer. He begins to read and speak French, pretty well. He behaves well, and is much esteemed here, which gives me constant Pleasure. -- His Sister is to blame for not writing to him as well as to me. -- He has been very good, is almost constantly writing to her, and his Brothers, and to his Cousins and his Friend Joshua Green, and many other Correspondents. He wrote a french Letter the other Day to his Grand Pa. He will write to his Grand ma, to whom present his and my most affectionate and dutiful Respects. As to , The Emperor and  [King] of Prussia are at War.  France and  England are the same altho there is yet no formal Manifesto.  America, I think has nothing to fear from  Europe. Let her chase away the broken Remnants of their her Ennemies, now within her Limits, and lay on Taxes, with a manly Resolution, in order to raise the Credit of her Currency and she will do very well. This is a delicious Country. Every Thing that can sooth, charm and bewitch is here. But these are no Enchantments for me. My Time is employed in the public Business, in studying French like a school Boy, and in fervent Wishes, that the happy Time may arrive soon, when I may exchange the Elegances and Magnificence of  Europe for the Simplicity of  Pens Hill, and the Glory of War, for the Obscurity of private Contemplation.

However, both concur to shew that the English had a drubbing. Birons fleet appears to have been shattered terribly in a storm. Several of his ships have returned to  Europe in sad plight. The Russell has returned to  England, scarcely able to swim and with upwards of 200 Men sick of the Goal Fever. -- Is it Presumption to imagine that one sees the Wrath of Heaven against a Nation overloaded with Guilt.

As the Subject was introduced, and according to the turn that the Conversation really took, there was not so much Vanity and Ostentation on my Part, as you will suspect from her Account of it. But as I speak french very imperfectly and she understands not a syllable of English I suppose she did not fully understand me. -- All that I maintained was that it was the Duty of a good Citizen to sacrifice all to his Country, in some Circumstances. God Grant I may never be called to do this again so often as I have done already: for I have hazarded all very often and done as much as sacrifice all sometimes. You will have a delicate Task to answer her. Write to her in English -- she has a  about five and twenty who is a Master of English and will interpret. It is a virtuous Family, and very civil to me and my dear  of whom the whole Family is very fond.

I send some Letters from , who intended to have written to his Brothers and indeed has written but there is not time to copy them. I think, that the Distance of Place, and the present perfect security which I enjoy, has by no Means lessened my Anxiety. We have no News from America since the  D'Estaing left  Sandy Hook. We expect News every Moment. -- I have sent you by  [Captain] Tucker all the Things you desired me to send, which I wish safe. I sent you ten Guineas worth of Linnen and Woolen by Captn. Barns, who I fear is taken. I have sent you a few Pounds of Tea by Captn. Niles and a few More by Mr. Austin.

"Passy  Novr. 6 1778
","My dearest Friend We have received Information that so many of our Letters have been thrown overboard, that I fear you will not have heard so often from me, as both of us wish. I have written often. But my Letters have not been worth so much as other Things which I have sent you. I sent you a small Present by Captain Niles. But he is taken by a Jersey Privateer. I sent you also, some other Things by Captain Barnes, and what affects me quite as much, I sent the Things that my dear  requested me to send, by the same Vessells. These Vessells were chosen because they were fast  Sailers, and so small as to be able to see Danger before they could be seen, but all is taken and sent into  Guernsy and  Jersy. By Captain Tucker I sent you the whole of the List you gave me of Articles for the Family. These I hope have arrived safe. But I have been so unlucky, that I feel averse to meddling in this Way. The whole Loss is a Trifle it is true: but to you, in the Convenience of the Family, and to  in his Business they would have been of Value. If the Boston arrives, the little Chest she carries to you will be of service. My Anxiety for you and for the public is not diminished by Time or Distance. The great Number of accidental  in the Course of the last summer are afflicting. But We hope for better Luck another Year. It seems to be the Intention of Heaven, that We should be taught the full Value of our Liberty by the dearness of the Purchase, and the Importance of public Virtue by the Necessity of it. There seems to be also a further Design, that of eradicating forever from the Heart of every American, every tender Sentiment towards  Great Britain, that We may sometime or other know how to make the full Advantage of our Independence by more extensive Connections with other Countries. Whatever Syren songs of Peace may be sung in your Ears, you may depend upon it from me, (who unhappily have been seldom mistaken in my Guesses of the Intentions of the British Government for fourteen Years,) that every malevolent Passion, and every insidious Art, will predominate in the British Cabinet against Us. Their Threats of Russians, and of great Reinforcements, are false and impracticable and they know them to be so: But their Threats of doing Mischief with the Forces they have, will be verified as far as their Power. It is by no means pleasant to me, to be forever imputing malicious Policy to a Nation, that I have ever wished and still wish I could esteem: But Truth must be attended to: and almost all  Europe, the Dutch especially, are at this day talking of  G. Britain in the style of American sons of Liberty. I hope the unfortunate Events at  Rhode Island will produce no Heart Burnings, between our Countrymen and the Comte D'Estaing, who is allowed by all  Europe to be a great and worthy Officer, and by all that know him to be a zealous friend of  America. I have enjoyed uncommon Health, since my Arrival in this Country and if it was Peace, and my family here, I could be happy. But never never shall I enjoy happy days, without either.  gives me great Pleasure, both by his Assiduity to his Books and his discreet Behaviour. The Lessons of his Mamma are a constant Law to him, and the Reflexion that they are so to his sister and Brothers, are a never failing Consolation to me at Times when I feel more tenderness for them, than Words can express, or than I should choose to express if I had Power. Remember me, in the most affectionate Manner to our Parents, Brothers, Sisters, Unkles, Aunts, and what shall I say -- Children. My Respects where they are due, which is in so many Places that I cannot name them. With Regard to my Connections with the Public Business here, which you will be naturally inquisitive to know something of, I can only say that We have many Disagreable Circumstances here, many Difficulties to accomplish the Wishes of our Constituents, and to give Satisfaction to certain half anglified Americains, and what is more serious  to real and deserving Americans who are suffering in  England and escaping from thence: But from this Court, this City, and Nation I have experienced nothing, but uninterupted Politeness.   It is not possible for me to express more Tenderness and Affection to you than will be suggested by the Name of "

","My dearest Friend Mr. Brown is here, and I cannot miss the Opportunity by him, to write you a Line. I know not how often you receive Letters from me, so many are taken, or sunk: but I write as often as I can. I have received some Letters from you, which will occasion your Name to be classed with Mrs. McCaulay and  for ought I know. Johnny is very well. Stevens had a fall Yesterday which hurt him a little: but not very badly. He is in a good Way this Morning. The Things inclosed which were a present to me you will do as you please with. Europe is the dullest Place in the World. No News but the , which the Emmissaries of  England are making and spreading, in every Part. We get no News from Congress or any Part of  America. By some Hints in some Letters which I have heard of I expect that the first  will bring us News of some new Regulations of Congress, concerning foreign Affairs. -- It is said that Congress have determined to have but one Commissioner at this Court. If this is true, as I suppose it is as it comes from Mr.  [Deane], I am uncertain what is to be done with me. It is said that I am to be sent to some other Court, and that the Dr. is to be here alone. If this should be the Case, I shall be puzzled what to do. The Motives of Congress are very good to save , but this Motive will not have its Effect, if I am to be maintained here, in Idleness, or sent upon my Travells to other Countries, where I shall not be received, which would be the most painfull situation imaginable to me. In this Case I should be at a Loss, whether to return home immediately or wait untill I could write to Congress and obtain Leave. Some of my friends here are of opinion that I ought not to return without Leave. I would not take any step that should give any just Cause of offence, to Congress or the People. But I cannot eat Pensions and Sinecures, they would stick in my Throat. I wish some honest  would arrive and remove my Doubts. "

","My dearest Friend Last Night an Express from M. De Sartine, whose Politeness upon this Occasion, was very obliging, brought me your Letters of  September 29  and  10  [has not been found] . The joy which the Receipt of these Packets afforded me, was damped, by the  Articles of Intelligence, but still more so by the Symptoms of Grief and Complaint, which appeared in the Letters. For Heavens Sake, my dear dont indulge a Thought that it is possible for me to neglect, or forget all that is dear to me in this World. It is impossible for me to write as I did in  America. What should I write? It is not safe to write any Thing, that one is not willing should go into all the Newspapers of the World. -- I know not by whom to write. I never know what Conveyance is safe. --  may have arrived without Letters from me. I am 500 Miles from  Bourdeaux and not much less distant from  Nantes. I know nothing of many Vessells that go from the Seaports, and if I knew of all there are some that I should not trust. Notwithstanding this, I have written to you, not much less I believe than fifty Letters. I am astonished that you have received no more. But almost every Vessell has been taken. Two Vessells by which I sent Goods to you for the Use of your Family and one by which I sent Mr. Cranches Things, We know have been taken, in every one of these I sent large Packetts of Letters and Papers for Congress, for you and for many Friends.  God knows I dont spend my Time, in Idleness, nor in gazing at Curiosities. I never wrote more Letters, however empty they may have been. But by what I hear they have been all or nearly all taken or sunk. My Friends complain that they have not received Letters from me. I may as well complain. I have received scarcely any Letters, from  America. I have written three, where I have received one. From my Friend Mr. A. I have received only one short Card -- from  not a syllable -- from Mr. Lovell only two or three very short. -- What shall I say? I doubt not they have written oftener -- but Letters miscarry. Drs. Cooper and Gordon write to Dr. F. not to me. My Friend  has been good as usual, I have received several fine long Letters full of Sound sense, Usefull Intelligence and Reflexions as virtuous as wise, as usual, from him. I have answered them and written more, but whether they arrive I know not. I approve very much of your draught upon me, in  of your Cousin. The Moment it arrives it shall be paid. Draw for more as you may have Occasion. But make them give you Silver for your Bills.  is the joy of my Heart, without abating in the least degree of my Affection for the young Rogue that did not seem as if he had a Father, or his Brother or sister. Tell Nabby, her Pappa likes her the better for what she tells her Brother, vizt. that she dont talk much, because I know she thinks and feels the more. -- I hope the  Boston has arrived-she carried many Things for you. Last Night a Friend from  England brought me the Kings Speech. Their Delirium continues, and they go on with the War, but the, Speech betrays a manifest Expectation that Spain will join against them, and the Debates betray a dread of  Holland. They have Reason, for both. They have not, and cannot get an Ally. They cannot send any considerable Reinforcement to  America. Your Reflections upon the Rewards of the Virtuous Friends of the, public are very just. But if Virtue was to be rewarded with Wealth it would not be Virtue. If Virtue was to be rewarded with Fame, it would not be Virtue of the sublimest Kind. Who would not rather   be Fabricius than Caesar? Who would not rather be Aristides, than even  [William] the 3d? Who? Nobody would be of this Mind but Aristides and Fabricius. These Characters are very rare, but the more . Nature has made more Insects than Birds, more Butterflys than Eagles, more Foxes than Lyons, more Pebbles than Diamonds. The most excellent of her Productions, both in the physical, intellectual and moral World, are the most rare. -- I would not be a Butterfly because Children run after them, nor because the dull Phylosophers boast of them in their Cabinets. Have you ever read J. J. Rousseau. If not, read him -- your Cousin smith has him. What a Difference between him and Chesterfield, and even Voltaire? But he was too virtuous for the Age, and for Europe. I wish I could not say for another Country. I am much  in not receiving Dispatches from Congress by this Opportunity. We expect Alterations in the Plan here. What will be done with me I cant conjecture. If I am recalled, I will endeavour to get a safe Opportunity, home. I will watch the proper Season and look out for a good Vessell. And if I can get safe to  Penns Hill, shall never repent of my Voyage to  Europe, because I have gained an Insight into several Things that I never should have understood without it. I pray you to remember me with every Sentiment of Tenderness, Duty and Affection, to  and my Mother, Your and my Brothers and Sisters, Uncles, Aunts, Cousins and every Body else that you know deserves it.  What shall I say too and of my dear young Friends by your Fireside, may God almighty bless them, and make them wise. "

","My dearest Friend Your two Letters of the   of Sept.  and  [l0th] of Oct. gave me more Concern than I can express. I will not say a Fit of the Spleen. But last night I got a Letter from Mr. Vernon, in which he acquaints me with the Arrival of the  Boston, at  Portsmouth. There were Letters from me on Board of the Boston, Providence or Ranger, and there was all the Things mentioned in the Memorandum, you gave me, this News has given me great Pleasure. I have sent other Things, on Board other Vessells since, with more Letters, which are all taken by the Ennemy, and among others all Mr. Cranchs Watch Materials. You must  expect to hear from me so often as you used: it is impossible. It is impossible for me to write so often. I have so much to do here, and so much Ceremony to submit to, and so much Company to see, so many Visits to make and receive, that, altho I avoid as many of them as I possibly can with Decency and some People think, more, it is impossible for me to write to you so often as my Inclination would lead me. I have been informed that Congress, on the 14 of September took up foreign Affairs and determined to have but one Minister, in France. By a Letter from  we learn that Congress had foreign Affairs on the 12 of October, still under Consideration, but gives no Hint of what is done or intended. This keeps me in a State of Uncertainty that is very disagreable. I have applied every Moment of my Time when Awake, and not necessarily engaged otherwise in learning, the Language, and the Laws, the Manners and Usages of this Nation, an occupation indisspensable in my situation. In order to avoid Expence, as much as possible, I have kept no Clerk altho every other Gentleman has constantly had two. In order to save Expences, and that I might be under the less Temptation to spend my Time unusefully, I have kept no Carriage, altho every other Gentleman has kept one Constantly and some Gentlemen two, and I am told I am the first public Minister that ever lived without a Carriage. By All these Causes together added to another Motive, viz. a Fear of Trusting our Books and Papers without a Keeper I have been almost constantly at home. Here are a Thousand Things to do, and no Body else to do them. The extensive Correspondence We have with Congress, with the Court, with our Frigates, our Agents, and with Prisoners, and a thousand others, employs a vast deal of my Time in Writing. You must therefore excuse me, if I dont write so often as I would. Yet I have written very often, but my Letters have miscarried. By your Letter, and another, I suspect that Parties are forming among you. I expect also, by some Letters I have seen from the , that a certain fine Gentleman will join another fine Gentleman, and these some other fine Gentlemen, to obtain some Arrangement that shall dishonnour me. And by Hints that are given out here, I should not wonder if I should be recalled, or sent to  Vienna which would be worse. I am  unhappy to see such Symptoms of Selfishness, Vanity and Ambition as manifest themselves in various Quarters, but I will not neither indulge these Passions myself, so nor be made the Instrument of them in others. Observing as I have a long Time the Characters of several Persons, I have long foreseen, that Parties must arise and this foresight has been the most forcible Motive with me to refuse a certain elevated Office  [The chief justiceship of Massachusetts] . Because I knew, that my public Conduct, to which I was necessitated by the clearest Dictates of my judgment, in the various intricate and hazardous Contingences of our Affairs, had exposed me to the Angry Passions of some Gentlemen of Consequence, who, altho obliged to cooperate with me, had often differed from me in Opinion. These I knew would render me, unhappy if not useless, in some situations, which determined me, to preserve my Independence, at the Expence of my Ambition, a Resolution in which I rejoice and ever shall rejoice. The Conflicts of these Passions, I expect, will very soon relieve me from the Duties of this station, and enable me to return to my Family and my Garden, the Ultimate Object of all my Hopes, Wishes and Expectations, for myself. And happy indeed shall I be if by the  of Heaven I can escape the danger of the Seas and of Ennemies, and return to the charming Office of Precepter to my Children. "

","My dearest Friend I cannot let this opportunity slip without sending you a Line, but the Gentleman waits and it can be but a Line. I have ordered you some Wine as you desired and a Present of some Tea and sugar -- But cant tell you by what  it will go. All Well. No Hopes of Peace, at least in my Mind. We must be taught to set an higher Value upon our Liberties before We shall obtain them. We are  anxious to know the Fate and Destination of D'Estaing and Biron, but have no News from  Boston later than 5 Novr., or rather the 4, I believe. Of Clinton and Washington We know nothing a long time. "

","My dearest Friend It is now my Turn to complain. Last night We had great  from the Council, but no Line from you. If Vessells sail from  Boston, within four Leagues of you, without your Knowledge, is it to be wondered that Vessells 500 Miles from me should sail without mine. What is more striking, altho our  [Plymouth] Friend had just received a Letter from me, I have no Line from him. We are not yet so happy, as to learn from Congress, what they have done upon foreign Affairs. We expect Intelligence every Moment -- I hope it will arrive, before the Fleet of Merchant Vessells sails, which is going out, that I may be able to inform you, how I shall be disposed of. We are now inquisitive to know where Clinton is gone, and . It is given out in  England that D'Estaing Clinton is gone to  Carolina. The British Fleet in  Europe makes but a poor Figure. Their Privateers have taken a great many Prizes, but the Kings ships come off, second best. You wish you had ventured with me -- I wish you was here -- no I dont, I wish I was there. But I assure you I know not how you could have lived  the Voyage. I often asked myself, what should I do if a certain Lady was with me. You can have no Adequate Idea of our Voyage. Did I ever tell you that  made me a Visit to clear up his Character. He declared to me upon his Honour, that he never wrote the Letters that were published in his Name, and that he never directly nor indirectly, had any Concern in Counterfeiting Continental Bills or New Hampshire Bills, or any other Paper Money. He desired me to let Mr. Apthorp know that he was well. I since hear, he has got a Pension of 500 a Year. A poor Pittance for a Governor to live on in  London -- especially with his Extravagant Humour. You are studying French I hope. Oh that I had studyed it, you know when. "

One was angry, another was full of Greif, and the third with Melancholy, so that I burnt them all. -- if you write me in this style I shall leave of writing intirely, it kills me. Can Professions of Esteem be Wanting from me to you? Can Protestation of affection be necessary? can tokens of Remembrance be desir'd? The very Idea of this sickens me. Am I not wretched Enough, in this Banishment, without this. What Course shall I take to convince you that my Heart is warm? you doubt, it seems. -- shall I declare it? shall I swear to it? -- Would you doubt it the less? -- And is it possible you should doubt it? I know it is not? -- If I could once believe it possible, I cannot answer for the Consequences. -- But I beg you would never more write to me in such a strain  for it really makes me unhappy. Be assured that no time nor place, can change my heart: but that I think so often & so much, of the Blessings from which I am  as to be too unmindful of those who accompany me, & that I write to you so often as my Duty will permit.

","My dearest Friend Mr. Greenleaf is about to set off, towards  Nantes and from thence to  Boston. Last Night, I walked to  Paris and saw the Illumination for the Birth of the Princess Maria Theresa Charlotta, Fille du Roi-Splendid indeed. My little Friend who was with me will write you a Description of it. The Military school, the Hospital of Invalids and the Palace of Bourbon, were beautiful and sublime indeed, as much so as an Illumination can be. I could scarcely have conceived that an Illumination could have such an Effect. I suppose the  of this is a Million of Livres. As much as I respect this Country, particularly the King and Royal Family I could not help reflecting how many Families, in another Country would this Tallow make happy for Life, how many Privateers would this Tallow fit out, for chasing away the Jerseymen and making Reprisals on Messrs. Les Anglois. -- But Taste will have its Way in this Country. The Queen and her illustrious Infant are very well, and this Nation is very happy to have discovered a Way, by which a Dauphin may come to them next Year, or the Year after. The  and  [Queen] are greatly beloved here -- every day shews fresh Proofs of it. On the other side the Channel there is a King, who is in a fair Way to be the object of opposite sentiments, to a Nation, if he is not at present. If Keppell should be destroyed in Life or Reputation, I shall expect to hear that all Restraints are taken off, and Passions allowed to sport themselves without Reserve. Keppell told the King he would not fight against  America -- an unpardonable . He will be ruined if possible. However I think that Keppell was wrong even to accept a Command against the French. If  [Britain] is wrong in this War against  America, she is wrong in that vs. the French, for  France and  America have the same Object in View and no other. France is right if America is right, because France only assisted the American Cause for which John Bull abused and fought her. But John will come off wretchedly. He will be beat. He has been beat. There have been more British Men of War already taken and destroyed, than they lost in two former Wars, and more sailors Prisoners. "

My Evils here arise altogether from Americans. and If I would have  myself under the Banners of Either Party, I might have filled  America I doubt not with Panegyricks of me, from one Party and Curses and Slanders from another. I have endeavoured to be hitherto impartial, to search for nothing but the Truth and to love nobody and nothing but the public Good, at least not more than the public Good. I have hoped that Animosities must might be softened, and the still small Voice of Reason heard more, and the boisterous Roar of Passions and Prejudices less. -- But the Publication of a certain Address to the People, has destroyed all such Hopes. Nothing remains now but the  Looking for of the fiery Indignation of the Monster Party, here.

Barns, Niles, and many other Vessells are lost. I have received Intelligence much more , than that of a removal to  Holland, I mean that of being reduced to a private Citizen which gives me more Pleasure, than you can imagine.

I must not write a Word to you about , because you are a Woman. What an  have I committed? -- a Woman! I shall soon make it up. I think Women better than Men in General, and I know that you can keep a Secret as well as any Man whatever. But the World dont know this. Therefore if I were to write any Secrets to you and the letter should be caught, and hitched into a Newspaper, the World would say, I was not to be trusted with a Secret. I never had so much Trouble in my Life, as here, yet I grow fat. The Climate and soil agree with me -- so do the Cookery and even the Manners of the People, of those of them  that I converse with, Churlish Republican, as some of you, on your side the Water call me. The English have got at me in their News Papers. They make fine Work of me -- fanatic -- Bigot -- perfect Cypher-not one Word of the Language -- awkward Figure-uncouth dress -- no Address -- No Character -- cunning hard headed Attorney. But the falsest of it all is, that I am disgusted with the Parisians-Whereas I declare I admire the Parisians prodigiously. They are the happiest People in the World, I believe, and have the best Disposition to make others so.

They cannot send any considerable Reinforcement, nor get an Ally in  Europe-this I think you may depend upon.

The Congress has not taken the least Notice of me. On the 11. of September they resolved to have one Minister only in  France, on the 14 they chose the Dr., in October they made out his Commission, the Alliance sailed in 14  and in all that Interval, they never so much as bid me come home, bid me stay, or told me I had done well or done ill. Considering the Accusation against Mr., how unexpected it was, and how groundless it is, I should not be at all surprized if I should see an Accusation against me for something or other. I know not what -- but I see that all Things are possible. Of all the Scenes I ever passed through, this is the most extraordinary. The Delirium among Americans here, is the most extravagant. -- All the infernal Arts of Stockjobbers, all the voracious avarice of Merchants, have mingled themselves with American  here, disturbed their operations, distracted our Councils, and turned our Heads. The Congress I presume expect that I should come home, and I shall come accordingly. As they have no Business for me in Europe I must contrive to get some for myself at home. -- Prepare yourself for removing to  Boston into the old House -- for there you shall go, and there, I will draw Writs and Deeds, and  jurys and be happy. "
"Passy  Feb. 21. 1779
","My dear Yours by Mr. Williams have received . The little Bill must be paid, but I confess it  me a little. The Expence of my Son here is greater than I ever imagined. Altho his Company is almost all the Pleasure I have, in Life, yet I should not have brought him, if I had known the Expence. His Expences, together with what you have drawn for, and a little Collection of Books I have bought, will amount to more than will ever be allowed me. My Accounts must not be drawn into Intricacy nor Obscurity. I must not be involved in Suspicions of medling in Trade, nor any Thing else but my proper Business. You complain that I dont write often enough, and that when I do, my Letters are too short. If I were to tell you all the Tenderness of my Heart, I should do nothing but write to you. I beg of you not to be uneasy. I write you as often and as much as I ought. If I had an Heart at Ease and Leisure enough, I could write you, several sheets a day, of the Curiosities of this Country. But it is as much impossible for me to think of such subjects as to work Miracles. Let me entreat you to consider, if some of your Letters had by any Accident been taken, what a figure would they have made in a Newspaper to be read by the whole World. Some of them it is true would have done  to the most virtuous and most accomplished Roman Matron: but others of them, would have made you and me, very ridiculous. In one of yours you hint that I am to go to  Holland. But I think you must be misinformed. By all that I can learn, some Gentlemen intend to vote for me to   vs. Mr. [Deane], others to  Spain vs. Mr. Lee. Neither I think will succeed, and therefore I think I have but one Course to steer, and that is homewards. But I can determine nothing absolutely. I must govern myself, according to the Intelligence, which may hereafter arise, the orders of Congress, and the best judgment I can form of my own Duty and the Public Good. I am advised to take a ride to  Geneva, or to  Amsterdam: and I have been so confined from Exercise, having never been farther from  Paris than  Versailles since my arrival here, that some such Excursion seems necessary for my Health, yet I cannot well bear the Thought of putting the public to an  merely for the Sake of my Pleasure, Health or Convenience. Yet my situation here is . I never was in such a situation before as I am now, and my present Feelings are new to me. If I should return, and in my Absence, any orders should arrive here for me to execute, in that Case nobody would be here to execute them, and they might possibly fail of success for Want of Somebody with Power to perform them. At least this may be suspected and said and believed. -- However, upon the whole, as Congress have said nothing to me good or bad, I have no right to presume that they mean to say any Thing and therefore, on the whole it is my duty to return, by the first good Opportunity, unless I should receive counter orders, before that occurs. If ever the Time should occur, when I could have a little Leisure and a quiet Mind, I could entertain you with Accounts of Things, which would amuse you and your Children. There are an Infinity of Curiosities here, but so far from having Leisure to describe them I have found none even to see them, except a very few. The  here is charming. The Weather is every day, pleasant as the Month of May -- soft mild Air, -- some foggy days, and about 10 or twelve days in January, were cold and icy. But we have had scarce 3 Inches of snow the whole Winter. The Climate is more favourable to my Constitution than ours. The Cookery, and manner of living here, which you know, Americans were taught by their former absurd Masters to dislike is more agreable to me, than you can imagine. The Manners of the People have an Affection in them that is very amiable. Their is such a Choice of elegant Entertainments in the theatric Way, of good Company and excellent Books, that nothing would be wanting to me in this Country, but my family and Peace to my Country, to make me, one of the happyest of Men. -- John Bull would growl and bellow at this Description-let him bellow if he will, for he is but a Brute. "
Feb. 26. 1779,"I have this day taken a long Ramble, with . The Weather is as delightfull as you can imagine. There is not in the Month of May, a softer Air, a warmer sun, or a more delicious Appearance of Things about  Boston. We walked all over the Gardens of the  , at  Passy. The Gardens are very spacious, one on one Quarter looking to  Mount Calvare, on another to the famous  Castle of Madrid, built by Francis the 1st, whose History you will see in Robertson,  [Charles] 5., on another looking over the  Plain de sablon, or  sandy Plain to the  Gate of Maillot. -- The Rowes of Trees, and gravel Walks are very pretty, and the orangerie are very grand. But the whole is much neglected -- the Trees are all mossy, and have a distempered Look. We then walked in the  Bois du Boulogne,  rambling about in by Paths, a long Time, till we came to a Gate which We presumed to open and found ourselves in a noble Garden, the salads green and flourishing ready for the Table, long Rows of Wall Fruits, Trees of every species, Apples, Peaches, Appricots,Plumbs &c. and next to the Garden a fine extensive Farm, the Fields and Pastures already shining with Verdure. Upon Enquiry of the Gardiners I was told it belonged to Madame Le Comtess de Bouflere Boufleure. We passed by the Castle, after having viewed all the Farm and Gardens, into the street of  Auteuil, the Village where Boileau was born, lived and died -- it is the next Village to  Passy. We then walked through the fields along the Castle and Seignoury of  Passy which belongs to the Comte De Boulainvilliers 
Page 3
 and returned home, much pleased with our Walk and better for the Air and Exercise. Now Madam dont you think I have spent my Time very wisely in writing all this important History to your Ladyship. Would it not have been as well spent in conjugating two or three french Verbs, which I could have done through all the Moods, Tenses and Persons, of the Active and passive Voice in this Time. We expect the  of Mr. Turgot, the famous Financier, as well as learned and virtuous Man, to dine with Us. And if there should be some Ladies, at the feast, it will not be at my Invitation and therefore you need not be uneasy. Suppose I should undertake to write the Description of every Castle and Garden I see as Richardson did in his Tour through Great Britain, would not you blush at such a Waste of my time. Suppose I should describe the Persons and Manners of all the Company I see, and the fashions, the Plays, the Games, the sports, the spectacles, the Churches and religious Ceremonies -- and all that should not  think me turned fool in my old Age -- have I not other Things to do of more importance? Let me alone, and have my own Way. You know that I shall not injure you and you ought to believe that I have good Reasons, for what I do, and not treat me so roughly, as you have done. "
Feb. 27. 1779,"The Weather continuing fine, I went to  Saint Denis a little Village about Eight Miles from this Place, where are the Tombs of all the Kings and Queens. The statues of all lie in state in Marble. The Church which is called the  Royal Church of Saint Denis is magnificent, and there is an  in a Chamber where the Crowns and many other Curiosities are preserved. It is curious to see such a Collection of Gold, Ivory and precious stones, as there is every Species I suppose that is mentioned in the Revelations. The Diamonds and Rubies glitter. -- But I confess I have so much of the savage sachem in me, that these Things make no great Impression upon me. There are several little Crucifixes here, which the Ecclesiastic, who showed them told Us, were made of Bits of the true Cross. -- This may be for any Thing that I know. In my Return, I took a Circuit round by  Mont Martre and dined at Home, with the Dr. who has a fit of the  Gout but is getting better. The situation in which my Masters have  me, puzzles me very much. They have said nothing to me, but one sett of Gentlemen write that I am to go to  Spain, another to  Holland, a third to  Vienna. But upon the whole I believe they dont intend to send me to either, but leave me, to stay here in a ridiculous situation or return home, if I can get there. I shall return, unless I should receive before the Time arrives for the  to sail, orders which I can execute with Honour, and a Prospect of rendering some service to the public. But of these two last Points I will judge for myself. "
Feb. 28. 1779,"I suppose I must write every day, in order to keep or rather to restore good , whether I have any thing to say or not. The Scaffold is  away, and I am left kicking and sprawling in the Mire, I think. It is hardly a state of Disgrace that I am in but rather of total Neglect and Contempt. The humane People about me, feel for my situation they say: But I feel for my Countrys situation. If I had deserved such Treatment, I should have deserved to be told so at least, and then I should have known my Duty. After sending orders to me at five hundred Miles distance which I neither solicited, nor expected nor desired, to go to  Europe through the Gulf Stream, through Thunder and Lightning, through three successive storms, and three successive Squadrons of British Men of War, if I had committed any Crime which deserved to hang me up in a Gibet in the  Face of all  Europe, I think I ought to have been told what it was -- or if I had proved myself totally insignificant, I think I ought to have been called away at least from a Place, where I might remain a Monument of the Want of Discernment in sending me here. I have given Notice here and written to Congress, of my Intentions to return, by the first good Opportunity, unless I should receive other orders before my Embarkation, orders that I can execute with  and some Prospect of Advantage to the Public. -- You know probably before now what orders if any are sent me. If none or such as I cannot observe you may expect to see me in June or July. If otherwise I know not when. "
Feb. 28. 1779,"This Day, the , his Lady, and Niece, Mr. Le Roy and his Lady, dined here. These Gentlemen are two Members of the Academy of Sciences. Now are you the wiser for all this? Shall I enter into a Description of their Dress -- of the Compliments-of the Turns of Conversation -- and all that. For mercy Sake dont exact of me that I should be a Boy, till I am Seventy Years of Age. This Kind of  will do for young Gentlemen and Ladies under 20, and might possibly be pardonable till 25 -- provided all was Peace and Prosperity. But old Men, born down with Years and Cares, can no more amuse themselves with such Things than with Toys, Marbles and Whirligigs. If I ever had any Wit it is all evaporated -- if I ever had any Imagination it is all quenched. Pray consider your Age, and the Gravity of your Character, the Mother of Six Children -- one of them grown up, who ought never to be out of your sight, nor ever to have an Example of Indiscretion set before her. I believe I am grown more austere, severe, rigid, and miserable than ever I was. -- I have seen more Occasion perhaps. "
"L'orient  May 14. 1779
","My dearest Friend I left  Paris on the Eighth of March, expecting to find the Alliance, at  Nantes and embark immediately for home, but when I arrived there I found the Alliance was still at  Brest. I went to  Brest 200 Miles from  Nantes, and after some Stay there the Alliance was ordered to  Nantes. I returned to Nantes, and when every Thing was ready to sail for  America, an order came from Court for the Alliance to go to  L'orient, and for me to go home in one of the Kings ships, with his new Ambassador to the united States, Le Chevalier de la Luzerne. It would fill a Volume to give you an History of my Adventures.  has accompanied me wherever I have been and is treated with more Attention than his father, tho that is as much as he wishes. Dont think hard of me for not writing. I have wrote as often as I could. But there are Letters of mine still in the Ports of this Kingdom, which were written I believe 9 Months ago-many many others are in the Sea. When you come to know how few Letters I have received from  America, you will be . There seems to be no Communication of Intelligence between the two Countries or worse than none. What the Sentiments or Intentions of Congress are concerning me, I know not. Shall find out in Time, I presume. But it seems to most People a little  that I should be sent here, and so soon forgotten, so entirely as neither to be ordered to stay, go or come. However, there are Reasons probably that We know not here. You may form an Idea of the Tenderness with which I expect to see you , in the Course of five or six Weeks. "
"L'orient  May 14. 1779
","My dearest Friend When I left  Paris, the 8 March, I expected to have been at Home before this Day and have done my Utmost to get to sea, but the Embarrassements and Disappointments I have met with, have been many, very many. I have however in the Course of them had a fine Opportunity of seeing  Nantes,  L'orient and  Brest, as well as the intermediate Country. By the gracious Invitation of the King, I am now to take Passage in his Frigate the Sensible, with his new Ambassador to America the Chevalier De la Luzerne. I hope to see you in six or seven Weeks.  Never was any Man in such a state of Uncertainty and suspense as I have been from last October, entirely uninformed of the Intentions of Congress concerning me. This would not have been very  to me if I could have got home, for Your Conversation is a Compensation to me, for all other Things.  has had a great Opportunity to see this Country: but this has unavoidably retarded his Education in some other Things. He has enjoyed perfect Health from first to last and is respected wherever he goes for his Vigour and Vivacity both of Mind and Body, for his constant good  and for his rapid Progress in French, as well as his general Knowledge which for his Age is uncommon. -- I long to see his Sister and Brothers -- I need not Add -- "
"L'orient  May 14. 1779
","My dearest Friend I am taking an Opportunity by every  that is going to inform you, that I am coming home as soon as possible. In Six or Seven Weeks I hope to have the Pleasure to see you, and my other Friends. The new French Ambassador, who goes out to relieve Mr. Gerard, will go in the same Frigate. We can get no News from  America of any Consequence, and not a syllable of any Kind from Congress. There is but one Piece of News in  Europe of any Importance, and that is from  Holland  and may be depended on, that the States General on the 26 of April, took the Resolution to convoy their Trade, notwithstanding Sir Joseph Yorks Memorial, and to fit out directly Thirty two Ships of War, for  that Purpose -- an important Event, which must have great Consequences. --  My Duty, Love and Respect, wherever due.

"L'Orient  June 14. 1779
","My dearest Friend I have been often disappointed, and therefore cannot be perfectly sure now: but my Baggage is all on Board a Frigate of the Kings, and I am to take Passage in her, with the Chevalier de la Luzerne the new Ambassador to the united States, and , the Secretary to the Commission, two Gentlemen of the most amiable Characters. Their will be Eighteen or twenty Persons in their Train. We expect to go to  Boston, but may possibly go to  Philadelphia. I ought not to give you an History of my Adventures for Four Months past,  I see you. This goes by another Vessell: but I hope you will see me before it. The French Fleet is out from  Brest, and the French look up now with a good Countenance.--England is torn with Distractions, and  Spain is expected soon to declare.  Holland and the Northern Powers have made Declarations   which sufficiently indicate their Determination, which is favourable to Us.  Britannia, in short must soon hearken to Reason. My dear Fellow Traveller is very well, and is the Comfort of my Life. He is much caressed, wherever he goes. -- Remember me to the rest. What can I say more?  No Words, no Actions can express the Ardour of Affection with which I am theirs & yours. Not one Line from  America since yours by the Alliance, nor any from Congress since October or the  of Novr. -- a Pause that has  [illegible]   consumed a great deal of my Patience, but I have Bags and Boxes of it yet left, in Abundance.

Perhaps however, it may not be till next day.  will come on board at Nine tomorrow.  has sent me a Card, to invite me to go on board with him in the  Castle Barge  [based at Castle Island in Boston Harbor, used for ceremonial purposes] . -- Dont make many Words of this.  has given me a Barrell of Cramberries. I shall make a good Use of them, I hope. Let me  you, to keep up your Spirits and throw off Cares as much as possible. Love to Nabby and Thommy.

","My dearest We got all on Board last night, and began to make our Arrangements.  and Johnny, slept in a large Cott in the Council Chamber. Charles and I, in my old Apartment. We all rested well. Charles is much pleased, with the Novelty of the Scaene. I stole on Board last night as silently as possible but as the Boat passed the Courier de L'Europe, all Hands came upon Deck and huzza'd in English, that is cryed Vive le Roi. And as We approached the Frigate, I saw all Hands mounting the shrowds and manning the ship,  at our stepping out of the Boat, We were saluted, with another Vive le Roi.  comes on Board, with Mr. Hancock in the Castle Barge at Nine or ten. I had a Letter last night from , who complains that Portia dont write him, and another, kind Letter from R. H. Lee.  and I were nominated for Holland. I suspect Laurens will be chosen and Lovel, go his Secretary. It is the Captains present Intention to fall down to  Nantaskett Road .  Day Day. "

C. Johonnot, are all a little Seasick, but this will soon be over. , Mr. Thaxter and myself are yet pretty well, but expect our Turn soon. We have strong hopes of escaping the Enemy upon this Coast.

","My dearest Friend A brave fellow from Boston  Carr, gives me an Opportunity of writing one Line, to let you know that We are all very well thus far. Charles behaves quite as well as John, and lies in my Bosom a nights. Mr. Dana has been very sea sick but is now pretty well. We are now out of all Danger of the Romulus and  Virginia, and I hope have little to fear, from the Ennemy. We have had one storm which made Us all sea sick, but brought Us on well in our Course. I wish I could write to you these two Hours, but Time fails. Ships cannot wait for each other at sea. My Love to Nabby and Thommy. Tell them, to mind their studies. Tell Nabby,  she has lost her french Master for  some time, I hope she will persevere, and perhaps a french Mistress in her Mamma may do better.

"Ferrol  December 11th. 1779
","My dearest Friend We have had an Escape again: but are arrived safely in  Spain. As the Frigate will probably not get from this place these two Months, I must go by Land to  Paris, which I suppose is a journey of between three and four hundred Leagues. That part of it, which is in  Spain is very mountainous. No Post-bad Roads-bad Taverns and very dear. We must ride Mules, Horses not being to be had. I must get some kind of Carriage for the Children, if possible. They are very well.  has sustained the Voyage and behaves as well as ever his Brother did. He is much pleased with what he sees. Sammy Cooper too is very well. These young Gentry will give me a vast deal of Trouble, in this unexpected journey. I have bought a Dictionary and Grammar and they are learning the Spanish Language as fast as possible. What could We do, if You and all the family had been with me? Ferrol is a magnificent Port and . It is fortified by Nature, by Rows of lofty rocky Mountains on each Side the narrow Entrance of it, and the public Works, the Fortifications, Barracks, Arsenals &c. which are of Stone very like Braintree Stone, exceed any thing I have seen. I dined the day before Yesterday with Don Joseph Saint Vincent, the Lieutenant General of the Marine, who is the Commandant in this Port, with four and twenty French and Spanish Officers. The Difference between Gravity and Gaiety was an amusing Speculation. Yesterday I dined on Board the Triumphant, an Eighty  Gun French Ship commanded by the Chef D'Escadre Mr. Sade, and have engagements for every day for a much longer Time than I shall stay. The French Consul and Vice Consul have been particularly polite and obliging to me. In short I never was better pleased with a Reception at any place. There is no News. Nothing has been done in  Europe.  England is as insolent in Language as ever, but this is only ridiculous as it is apparently impotent.  My Love to  and Tommy. Adieu.  "
"Ferrol  Decr. 12. 1779
","The french Consul had agreed to carry me, , Mr. Allen, and my three Children and our three Servants, this Day to  Corunna, which is about five Leagues from this Place by Water, in a barge of fourteen Oars, but the Weather proved so boisterous, that it was impossible to go. To give you some Idea of the Place where We are,  Cape Finisterre, and  Cape Ortugal  are two long Arms of Land stretched out into the Sea, which embrace a large Bay of Water. Within this Bay are two other Points of Land, within one of which is  Ferrol, where we now are, and within the other is  Corunna where We intended to have gone this day, if the Weather had permitted, but We hope to go tomorrow. We can get neither Horses nor Mules nor Carriages in this Place for our Selves nor our Baggage, which I am much  at, as it is so grand a Port. Living, and conveniences for Conveyance are very dear, in this Place, which will run my  very high.  There is nothing remarkable here, but the natural strength of the Place, and the artificial Fortifications, together with the Arsenals, dry Docks, Barracks, and military Matters by Sea and Land. The City is small, not very well built nor accommodated. Very little Commerce, or Manufactures, Industry or Diversions. There are two or three elegant Churches, and there is an Italian Opera. There is the Appearance of much Devotion and there are many . It is dull enough to be in a Country so wholly ignorant of the Language and Usages, but We have furnished ourselves with a Dictionary and grammar, and are learning every Hour.  is much pleased with what he sees and hears, and behaves very discreetly. John is writing to you and his sister and Brother. I excused myself from dining  on board the Souvereign and on board the Jason, two french Men of War. Yesterday I dined on board the Triomphant, and the Children on Board the Jason. The French Officers appear , with Cockades, in Honour of the Triple alliance -- a large white Ribbon for the french, a smaller red one for the Spaniards, and a black one for the Americans, which makes a pretty Appearance. Upon looking a little into the Spanish Language, I find it so very nearly like the Latin that I am persuaded we shall learn more of it in a Month than We did of french in  a Year. The Manners of the Spaniards and french are as opposite as grave and gay. The Dress of the Spanish Officers is much like the french, that of the People, a little different. Men and Women, Gentlemen and Ladies are very fond of long Hair, which often reaches braided in a Queue, , almost down to their Hams. The Ladies wear Cloaks black or white which come over their Heads and shoulders and reach down to their Waists. They have fine black Eyes and consequently dark, but yet lively complexions. When! Oh When! shall I see you again and live in Peace? The Russian Embassador, lately appointed to relieve the one lately in  London passed through  France and was a fortnight or three Weeks at  Paris from whence, the shrewd Politicians have conjectured that Peace was about to be mediated by that Power. But it is said that  England is as reluctant to acknowledge the  of  America, as to cede  Gibraltar, the last of which is insisted on as well as the first. But this is only Bruit.  Adieu. "
"Corunna  December 16. 1779
","My dearest Friend Last night We all arrived in this Place from  Ferrol. The Distance is about twenty miles by Land over high Mountains and bad Roads. You would have been diverted to have seen Us all mounted upon our Mules and marching in Train. From the Mountains We had all along the Prospect of a rich fertile Country, cultivated up to the Tops of the highest Hills and down to the very edge of Water all along the shore. I made my Visits last night to the Governor of the Province, who resides here and to the Governor of the Town, and was politely received by both. I have a long journey before me of a thousand miles I suppose at least to  Paris. Through this Kingdom We shall have bad roads and worse Accommodations, I dont expect to be able to get to  Paris in less than thirty days. I shall have an Opportunity of seeing  Spain, but it will be at a great . I am advised by every Body to go by Land. The Frigate the Sensible is in so bad Condition as to make it probable she will not be fit to put to Sea in less than three or four Weeks perhaps five or six, and then We should have the storms and Enemies of the  Bay of Biscay, to escape, or encounter. After this wandering Way of Life is passed I hope to return, to my best friend and pass the Remainder of our Days in Quiet. I cannot learn that  is yet in Temper to listen to Propositions of Peace, and I dont expect before another Winter to have much to do in my present Capacity.   My tenderest affection to our dear Children, and believe me, ever yours, "
"Bilbao  January 16. 1780
","My dearest Friend We arrived here, last night, all alive, but all very near sick with violent Colds taken on the Road for Want of comfortable Accommodations. I was advised, on all Hands to come by Land rather than wait an uncertain Time for a passage by sea. But if I had known the Difficulties of travelling, in that part of  Spain which I have passed through I think I should not have ventured upon the journey. It is vain to attempt a Description of our Passage. Through the Province of  , and again when We came to that of  Biscay, We had an uninterupted succession of Mountains; thro that of  Leon and the old  Castile, constant Plains. A Country, tolerably good, by Nature, but not well cultivated. Through the whole of the journey the Taverns were inconvenient to Us, because there are no Chimneys in their Houses and We had cold Weather. A great Part of the Way, the Wretchedness of our Accommodation exceeds all Description. At  Bilbao, We  fare very well, and have received much Civility from Mr. Gardoqui and sons as We did at  Ferrol and  Corunna from Mr. Detournelle and Mr. Lagoanere. I wish I could send you, some few Things for the Use of the Family from hence, but the Risque is such that I believe, I had better wait  We get to  France. I have undergone the greatest Anxiety for the Children,  a tedious journey and Voyage. I hope their Travels will be of Service to them, but those at home are best off. My Love to them. "

","My dearest Friend On Wednesday, the 9th. of this Month, We all arrived in tolerable Health at the  Hotel De Valois, in  Paris where We now are. On Thursday the l0th We waited on Dr. F.  and dined with him at  Passy. On Fryday the 11, the Dr. accompanied Us to  Versailles, where We waited on Mr. De Vergennes, Mr. De Sartine and Comte Maurepas, from all of whom We had a polite Reception. To day We stay at home. I put  to Mr. Pichini's Accademy the next day after my Arrival, where they are all well pleased. We had a tedious journey by Land, from  Ferrol in Spain, of not much short of four hundred Leagues. My dear  bears traveling by Land and Sea as well as his Brother. He is much beloved wherever he goes. Since my Arrival here I had the joy to find a Letter from you which came by  ship to  Cadiz. It gives me more Pain than I can express to see your Anxiety, but I hope your fears will be happily disappointed. I wrote you,  from  Cape Anne ,  from the Banks of  Newfoundland ,  from  Corrunna  and  from  Bilbao , from whence I ordered you some Things by a  to Mr. Corbet  [Cabot] of  Beverly, and another to Mr. Tracy of  Newbury Port.

"Paris Hotel De Valois  Feb. 16. 1780
","My dearest Friend I have the  to be lodged here with no less a Personage than the Prince of Hesse Castle, who is here upon a Visit. We occupy different Apartements in the same House and have no Intercourse with each other to be sure: but some Wags are of Opinion, that if I were authorized to open a Negotiation with him, I might obtain from him as many Troops to fight on our Side the Question, as he has already hired out to the English against Us. I have found every Thing  here as yet: The Children are happy in their Academy, of which I send you the Plan inclosed. The English bounce a great deal about obtaining seven Thousand Troops from the  german Princes and ten Thousand from  Ireland to send to  America: but this is only a Repetition of their annual Gasconade. We are in Pain for  Charlestown S.C. being apprehensive that they have made or will make an Effort to obtain that: which will be a terrible Misfortune to that People and a great Loss to  the United States: but will be no lasting Advantage to our Ennemies. The Channel of Correspondence you propose by Way of  Bilbao and  Cadiz will bring me many Letters no doubt, and I have received  one of the 10   but the Postage is so expensive, being obliged to pay forty four Livres for the Packet that came with yours, that I would not advise you to send any Thing that Way unless it be a single Letter, or any Thing material in the journals of Congress, or Letters from my friends in Congress or else where that contain any thing particularly interesting. Mr. G The House of Joseph Guardoqui and Sons have sent to you by Capt. Babson of  Newbury Port belonging to Mr. Tracy, some necessaries for the family, and you may write to Mr. Guardoqui, for any Thing you want, by any Vessell belonging to your Uncle, to Mr. Jackson or Mr. Tracy, provided you dont exceed one hundred Dollars by any one Vessell. Mr. Guardoqui will readily send them and draw upon me for the Money. I had a great deal of Pleasure in the Acquaintance of this Family of Guardoqui's and was treated by them with the Magnificence of a Prince. They will be very glad to be  to you in any Thing they can do. You will remember however that We have many Children, and that our Duty to them requires that We should manage all our Affairs with the strictest OEconomy. My journey through  Spain, has been infinitely expensive to me, and exceeded far my Income. It is very expensive here and I fear, that I shall find it difficult to make both Ends meet, but I must and will send you some thing for necessary Use by every oportunity. If Mr. Lovell does not procure me the Resolution of Congress I mentioned to him, that of drawing on a certain Gentleman or his Banker, I shall soon be starved out. Pray mention it to him. If you should have an Inclination to write to  Cadiz, for any Thing by any  going there, Mr. Robert Montgomery, who is settled there I fancy would chearfully send it you, and draw upon me in  Paris for his Pay. If any Vessell should go to  Corunna, Mr. Michael Lagoanere would do the same, but this is not a likely Way. I shall write as often as possible: but Conveyances will be very rare, I fear. "

","My dearest Friend The Children made me a Visit , and went with me to dine with my old Friends the two Abbys, whom you have often heard me mention, Chalut and Arnoux, who desire me to mention them to you in my Letters as devoted Friends of  America, and particular Friends to me and to you, notwithstanding the difference of Religion. The Children are still in good Health, and Spirits and well pleased with their Academy. Ah! how much Pain have these young Gentlemen cost me, within these three months. The Mountains, the Cold, the Mules, the Houses without Chimneys or Windows, the -- . I will not add. I wish for a Painter to draw me and my Company mounted on Muleback, or riding in the Calashes, or walking; for We walked, one third of the Way. Yet by the Help of constant Care and great Pains and , I have been able to get them all safe to Paris. The other Moyety of the Family is quite as near my Heart, and therefore I hope they will never be ramblers. I am sick of rambling. If I could transport the other  of the Family across  the Atlantick with a Wish and be sure of returning them, when it should become necessary in the same manner, how happy should I be! I have been received here with much Cordiality, and am daily visited by Characters who do me much . Some day or other you will know I believe, but had better not say at present. Your Friend, the Comte D'Estaing, however I ought to mention because you have been acquainted with him. I have dined with him, and he has visited me and I him, and I hope to have many more Conversations with him, for public Reasons, not private, for on a private Account great Men and little are much alike to me. Mr. Lee and Mr. Izard are going home in the Alliance, and I hope will make you a Visit. How many  they are to experience, as well as I, and all the rest of our Countrymen I know not. The Events of Politicks are not less uncertain than those of War. Whatever they may be, I shall be content. Of whone thing I am pretty sure, that if I return again safe to  America, I shall be happy the Remainder of my days because I shall stay at home-and at home I must be to be happy. There is no Improbability at all that I may be obliged to come home again soon, for want  means to stay here. I hope however, that Care will be taken that something may be done to supply Us. My tenderest Affection to my dear Nabby and Tommy. They are better off than their Brothers, after all. I have been taking measures to send home your Things, , Mrs. Cranches, Mr. W. and Mr. S. I hope to succeed by the Alliance, it shall not be my fault if I do not. If I cannot send by her I will wait for another Frigate if it is a Year, for I have no Confidence in other Vessells. "

","My dearest Friend   The House of Joseph Guardoqui and Sons of  Bilbao, have sent you some necessaries to the Amount of about 200 Dollars, by Captain Babson of  N. Port, belonging to Mr. Tracy, and I have ordered them to send duplicates and Triplicates, by other good Opportunities. I have also written to Mr. Moylan of  L'orient to send all the Things of which you gave me Minutes, for yourself, Mr. W. M. S. my Brother and Mrs. W, by the Alliance. If these things should all arrive safe, they will be of Use. I am afraid however to send more, which I wish to do, because I am not sure of Remittances, nor of Authority to draw upon a Gentleman here. I wish you would give a hint to  of the Embarrassment I shall be in, if he does not send me the Necessary, either in Bills, Merchandizes, or Orders to draw upon he knows whom. The English are more in a Disposition to go to War with one another, I think than to make Peace, with the rest of the World, at present. But notwithstanding a few late successes, they will have their Hands full another Campaign. I am told I am to be presented to the King and Royal Family, soon. I have delivered your Letter to Madam Grand, and she makes a thousand Compliments upon it. It is indeed a fine Letter, and I confess myself very proud of it, as I am of my two Boys, who behave very well. My two other Children, are however, I think oftener in my Mind,  I think their Morals and studies too, under a safer directress. Yet the Academy where they are is very well governed. Mr. Thaxter is of more Service to me than you can well imagine. He is steady, prudent, firm, faithful and indefatigable. He is a great  to me, and must unavoidably be, but I am very happy in having taken him. Mr. Dana has enjoyed very good Health since his Arrival here. His Headachs have left him entirely. I hope my dear Nabby pursues her studies, what would I give that I could assist her? The Marquis de la Fayette is going as well as Mr. Lee and Mr. Izard, and further the Court have divided  the American Continent into three districts, for their Consuls, and have appointed  to the Middle one, Mr  to the southward and Monsieur De L'Etombe, for the northern Department, or the Eastern states, to reside at  Boston where he will soon go. I shall write by him. "
"Paris  Feb. 28. 1780
","My dearest Friend I have sent you,  one yard of fine Cambrick, at 14 Livres an Ell,  [illegible]  two of a coarser sort at 6 Livres an Ell. Eight  India Handkerchiefs at 6 Livres each and three of another stamp at 6 Livres a Piece. These seem monstrous dear, but I could not get them cheaper. If  should make you a Visit You will treat him with all Distinction that is due to his Merit and Character, as well as his Birth and Rank which is are very high. He has been the invariable and indefatigable Friend of  America, in all Times, Places and Occasions, and his Assiduity have done Us much service. He is my particular Friend, and therefore deserves from mine, the greatest Respect, on my private Account as well as on the public.  "
"Paris  Feb. 28. 1780
","My dearest Friend I have already sent to the Marquis de la Fayette, a Number of Letters for you, and , from their Brothers, who favoured me with their Company last night and are just gone off to the Accademy. Charles's Master is full of his Praises, and John I think is more solid and steady than ever. In two of the Letters to you, you will find no Writing, only a small Present to you and  not meaning to exclude Mr. Tommy. I will endeavour to send more little Things of this Nature in the same manner, by several Opportunities. I can send small Things in this Way by Gentlemen, who may go by french Frigates or other good Opportunities, and I wish you would inform me, what Things you want that may be sent in the same manner. I hope the Marquis will do your Ladyship the  of a Visit, at  Braintree, and am sure he will if he comes to  Boston and is not too impatient to get to the Field of Honour, which from the Keenness of his Passion for Glory, may very possibly be the Case. The Marquis has a son since his Arrival in  Europe, whom he has named , not from the King of G.B. but his Friend Washington.  told me News Yesterday, which he has from  England, but it seems too extraordinary to me, to be true. That the Irish Parliament have repealed Poynings Law: declared that no Legislature has Authority over  Ireland, but the Irish Houses of Lords and Commons and the King of Ireland,  and prohibited all Appeals from the House of Lords in  Ireland to the House of Lords in  England -- and sent these Laws to  England for Approbation of the King.  Ireland to be sure is not yet quieted, by all Lord Norths Address, which contrasted with his Conduct to  America is curious. We have no News from  America since Christmas, and very little since We sailed from  Boston. According to present Appearances the Field of Action the next Campaign will be the  West India Islands.  "

","My dearest Friend I have sent you Things from  Bilbao, by Captain Babson, and a small present by the M. de la Fayette, another by Mr. Lee, another by Mr. Wharton, and shall send another by Mr. Brown, another by Mr. Izard, and perhaps another by the Viscount de Noailles, and the Alliance will bring you and your , what you and they wrote for. I intend to tax every Gentleman who goes from here, towards the Support of my Family so far as to buy the  of him to take a small present. I have had the  to be presented in Form to the King, Queen and Royal Family of  France, but see no great Prospect of being presented in a similar manner in  London. I fancy, his Majesty of London St. James's would not look so placidly upon me, as that of  Versailles did, nor the Queen, nor the Princesses and Princesses. They would be apt to reflect that I had some hand in disseizing them of some Part of the Inheritance of the Princess Sophia of  Hanover altho they are protestants, in Spight of the Act of Settlement. The  West Indies will be according to Appearances the Field of Battle, so you will be at Your Ease,  I hope. I hope this will go by the Viscount Noailles, Brother of the Marquise de la Fayette, and an  [illegible]   amiable Youth he is. I dont know whether to prefer the Marquis to him. He was with the C. D'Estaing in  Georgia. I wish Success to all Enterprizes, that are directed at right Objects. I dont pretend to tell Tales nor guess at Secrets. The K. and the General only ought to know. Rodney and Digby have had a run of Luck, that vexes one a little, but the Tide may turn, and that would be ruin to them, which is only Vexation to their . The Gentlemen, the Children, and servants are well.  "
"Paris  March 15, 1780
","My dearest Friend , whom I left at  Passy, when I returned to you, and whom I found here, upon my return to  Paris, will deliver you this and another Letter which I intended to have sent by the Viscount de Noailles, and two small Bundles containing a Piece of Chintz each. The Price is horrid, Sixty Livres a Piece, but I cannot trade, I suppose others would get them at half Price. If you will make me buy Dittoes you must expect to be cheated. I never bought any Thing in my Life, but at double Price. , with Sammy Cooper dined with me to day. Charles begins to speak French very well, and Cooper too. Mr. Brown formerly lived with Governor Trumbull. Captain Carpenter who sailed a few days after me in the Cartell for  London dined with me . The English Ministry will not allow of an Exchange. He tells me the Gentry of  Brompton Row firmly believe that  America cannot hold out five Months longer. My Duty to , my Mother, Brothers, sisters, Uncles, Aunts and Cousins. Yours Yours, forever and forever.  "

","My dear Portia I have never answered  your Letter of the 8th. of June , that I remember, and there is nothing in it that requires a particular Answer but it affects me, with a Pleasure and a Tenderness and an Anxiety and a Pain, that I cannot describe to you, as all your Letters ever did and ever will, that describe your own sentiments and your own Distresses as well as those of our Country. They are the Delight of my Soul. , who is escaped from an English Prison, will carry this. He will dine with me today, with Captain Nathaniel Cutting, and another American, but are in such Haste and going off this Afternoon, so that I have no time to be particular only to say, that my fine Boys are well and behave well, which will give joy to your Heart as it does to mine. Remember me to  and my Mother, to your two dear Pledges, and to all Friends. Thaxter learns french fast. He is very clever. Captain Chevagne, who ceases not to sing the high Praises of  Boston and  Braintree, writes me his desire that I would present his Respects to you, and to tell you that he hopes one day to carry me back, to you. No News, since the Dismal Tales of  League with old Harry, for one would think nothing less would have given him so much Luck, but his Friend will leave him in the Lurch. Pray give me, in all your Letters, the Price . "
"Paris  16 March 1780
","My dear  I have not particularly answered  your amiable Letter of 10  . Your tender Anxiety distresses me, much: I hope your Faith however, has returned before now with your Spirits. If Captain Trash arrived safe from  Corunna you have heard from me, or if Babson from  Bilboa. Your delicate  is as hardy as a flynt. He sustains every thing better than any of Us, even than the hardy Sailor his Brother. He is a delightful little fellow. I love him too much. My fellow Travellers too are very well. Mr. D's head ack is perfectly cured -- not a groan nor a wry look. There are some , one at least that can never be odious, by Sea nor Land, yet she would have been miserable in both if she had been with me. The Governor of Gallicia told me I risqued a great deal to bring my two  [sons] with me, but I should have risqued my All if I had brought you. We have a calm at present: no News from  America, nor from any other Quarter since the long Roll of  successes, which have made the English very saucy for the Moment, but this will not last long. Captain Carpenter of the Cartel ship has been here from  London and dined with me yesterday. They took his ship from him, and refused the Exchange of Prisoners. Thus ill natured are they. The Refugees, according to him are in bad Plight, not having received their Pensions these 18 Months, which are detained on some Pretence of waiting for Funds from  Quebec. Yet they console themselves with the Thought that  America cannot hold out another six Months. Thus  and Goffe expected Deliverance, Glory and Tryumph every day by the Commencement of the Millenium, but died without seeing it. Governor Hutchinsons son Billy died in  London about 3 Weeks ago. "

He is recommended to me by Some of my Friends particularly the Abbys Chalut and Arnone, as a sensible worthy agreable Man.  I hope we shall have this Summer, and forever hereafter more frequent Communication between France and America. This Gentleman or the French Counsel at Boston or your Friends at Philadelphia, or general Knox or the Marquis de la Fayette or the Viscount De Noailles, in the Army or the Chevalier de La Luzerne or Mr. Marbois, will take Charge of your Letters and  them, to him, whose Delight they are, when they dont censure, nor complain of him, when they do they are his greatest Punishment.

","My dear  This goes by , whom you know, who desires to carry a Letter to you. My three Boys dined with me Yesterday, being a Playday for them, in fine Health and Spirits. I long to hear, whether Captain Trash arrived from  Corunna, who had Letters from me to you, or Captain Babson who had Letters and more. I dont know whether you have yet heard of our Arrival. There are a great Number of Letters for You, in the Hands of the Marquis de la Fayette, the Viscount de Noailles, Mr. Lee, Mr. Brown, Mr. Izard, and others.

"[Paris,   April - May 1780]","My dear Portia Yesterday We went to see the Garden of ,  Jardin du Roi, and his Cabinet of natural History, Cabinet d'Histoire naturell. The Cabinet of natural History is a great Collection, of Metals, Mineral, shells, Insects, Birds, Beasts, Fishes, and  stones. They are arranged in good order, and preserved in good condition, with the name of every thing beautifully written on a piece of paper annexed to it. There is also a Collection of Woods and marbles. The garden is large and airy, affording fine Walks between Rows of Trees. Here is a Collection from all Parts of the World, of all the plants, Roots and Vegetables that are used in medicine, and indeed of all the Plants and trees in the World. A fine  for the studious youth in Physick or Philosophy. It was a public day. There was a great deal of Company, and I had opportunity only to take a cursory view. The whole is very curious. There is an handsome statue of Mr. Buffon, the great natural Historian whose Works you have, whose labours have given fame to this Cabinet and Garden. When shall We have in  America, such Collections? The Collection of American Curiosities that I saw at  Norwalk in Connecticutt made by Mr. Arnold, which he afterwards to my great mortification sold to Gov. Tryon, convinces me, that our Country affords as ample materials, for Collections of this nature as any part of the World. Five midshipmen of the Alliance, came here last night, Marston, Hogan, Fitzgerald and two others, from  Norway, where they were sent with Prizes, which the Court of  Denmark were absurd and unjust enough, to restore to the English. They however treated the Officers and People well, and defrayed their .  They say the Norwegians were very angry, with the Court of  Copenhagen, for delivering up these . It was the Blunder of Ignorance, I believe, rather than any ill Will. Every day when I ride out, without any particular Business to do, or Visit to make, I order my servant to carry me to some place where I never was before, so that at last I believe I have seen all  Paris, and all the fields and scenes about it, that are near it. It is very pleasant.  is as well beloved here as at home. Wherever he goes, every body loves him. Mr. D is as fond of him, I think as I am. He learns very well. There is a Volume in folio just published here, which I Yesterday, run over at a Booksellers shop. It is a description and a copper Plate of all the Engravings upon precious stones in the Collection of the Duke of Orleans. The stamps are  beautiful, and are representations of the Gods and Heroes of Antiquity, with most of the fables of their Mithology. Such a Book would be very usefull to the Children in studiing the Classicks, but it is too dear -- 3 Guineas, unbound. There is every Thing here that can inform the Understanding, or refine the Taste, and indeed one would think that could purify the Heart. Yet it must be remembered there is every thing here too, which can seduce, betray, deceive, deprave, corrupt and debauch it. Hercules marches here in full View of the Steeps of Virtue on one hand, and the flowery Paths of Pleasure on the other-and there are few who make the Choice of Hercules. That my Children may follow his Example, is my earnest Prayer: but I sometimes tremble, when I hear the  songs of sloth, least they should be captivated with her bewitching Charms and her soft, insinuating Musick. "
April 6 1780,"My dear Portia There is a great deal of hatred against the  in  England as you will see by the song inclosed. They are going on, with County meetings, Petitions, Committees, Correspondences, Associations &c. in our model What it will come to, I dont know. They talk in  London about withdrawing the Troops, &c., but I suspect, We had better take em, least they should alter their minds. At last a  has arrived at  Bourdeaux from  Baltimore, brings two or three newspapers, as late as 17 feb. but no Letters. You have had a hard Winter, but I hope you had a good fire. I had a harder, without any fire, in  Spain. I am so taken up, with writing to   that I dont write to you so often as I wish. I hope you wont complain of me this time for not writing often enough, and long enough whatever may be the worth of it. I hope you will advertise me, if there are any Machinations going forward. All well. "
May 3. 1780,"My dear Portia Having just heard of a Small Brig bound directly from  Nantes to  Boston, I write you, one Line. The day before Yesterday, I had a letter from your  by Way of  Amsterdam, 26 February. I should advise you to embrace these Opportunities by Way of  Spain and  Holland, otherwise I shall very seldom hear from you. There are a full Bushell of Letters from me, and your share is among them, on their Way, but when they will arrive I know not. The English Stocks are fallen two Per Cent and they are expected to fall much more on Account of the Confederation of the maritime powers in support of Reason, Justice and Common Sense against the Extravagancies of  Great Britain. Convulsed at home,  Ireland falling off, after  America, and all the Nations of  Europe agreed in one Plan, against her: Yet the Government of  England diminish none of their Pride, Obstinacy, or other, unsocial Passions. I have not a Line from Congress, and  but one from you , since my departure now almost 6 months. I wrote you by Trash, Babson, and the Marquis de la Fayette -- these are all arrived I hope. The Alliance has many Letters from me  on board -so has the Fleet of de Rochambeau. We are all well. So Nabby goes to  Boston on the Ice. Tell Tommy he is his Papas , because he left him to enjoy the Company of his Mama, and his sister. His Brothers are well and learn cleverly, but not so fast as he, I believe. "
May 5. 1780,"My dear Portia By your Uncles Letter of 26 , he could not hear of any Letters from me by Trash. I certainly wrote by him from  Corunna, so did the Children. I wrote to Congress, as well as to you. I wrote also by Babson, who carried some Things for you, from  Bilbao. I hope the letters are not lost. I went a few days ago to  Bi etre, to see the Curiosities of that Place. It is a Bedlam for the Mad, a Prison for Felons, an hospital for the Poor, and particularly for the most abandoned and decayed Women of the Town. -- What a Collection of Insanity, Criminality, and Misery! -- It is impossible for me to find time to describe in detail the Things that I saw there. The Objects of , which are there in such Numbers and such Variety of sorts, would be too painfull to describe. There are 4600 Persons, in this Castle and its Appendages, including the distracted, the Culprits, the Poor, and the Tradesmen who reside there, and whose  are necessary, for the subsistance and Accommodations of the Inhabitants of the Place. It is about 3 miles out of the City. In a beautifull and airy situation -- it has a large fine Garden -- a spacious Court Yard: but the most remarkable thing is a Well, 45 feet in Circumference and of a vast depth out of which they draw all the Water for the Place. It is poured into a vast Reservoir, Square, and 9 feet deep, from whence it is taken for the supply of the People. I went next Day to see the , which is at the Place of L.  [Louis] 14. Here were riches and Magnificence without End -- Gold, silver and prescious stones. But I cannot enter into Descriptions of particulars. After which We all went to see the Hospital of Invalids. "
May 12 1780,"My dear Portia  has at last arrived, he dined with me, Yesterday and today. He has been taken, and been to  London  [and] from thence to  Amsterdam. All his Letters to me from Congress, the Council and my friends, he cast into the Sea. What a Loss! Oh how I regret it! But he brought from  Amsterdam,  yours of 26   but how was I mortified, to find that you had not received my Letters from  Ferrol and  Corunna. It was only to day that I went out to carry My sons Letter from his Cousin, that I learnt by a Postscript the 29 of Feb. that he had just received a Letter from him dated  Ferrol Decr. 12. From this I conclude, you had mine. I have this day a Letter from , that he has delivered to Dr. Winship in the Alliance a Chest with the Things you desired and others. But after all I fear she will go to a wrong Place. It is the only Opportunity I could get. Pray write me by every Vessell to  Holland and  Spain. I find they are the best Opportunities. You cant imagine how  was pleased with the Welfare of his Bird &c. I have given him a beautiful pair, which pleases him much. He speaks french like an Hero. My dear daughter dont write me. I wish I could write to her, but I cant get time. Tom too, how fares my favourite boy? He's best off. We all envy him. As to Taxes, the more they tax me, provided they tax others in Proportion, the happier I am. It is our best Policy and I fear our only Resource. The fleet and Army are sailed from  Brest, and another I suppose from  Spain --  Cadiz. We hope Clinton wont get  Charlestown but We are afraid. If he does he wont keep it long I fancy. There are many Letters from me on board the french fleet, wherever it is gone -- many others with the Marquis de la Fayette -- many more in the Alliance which have been there I know not how long. I never wrote so much in my Life, yet it seems as if none of it would ever get to  America. You had Letters by Babson and Knives and Forks. and Tumblers. Peace is my dear delight, but when shall I see it? They have not attacked me very furiously, in the English Papers, as yet. They have called me once Rebel Chieftain and once Rebel Plenipotentiary, no more yet. I expect they will have at me, by and by. True conscious  is to know no sin. I wish you had told me what Gellee's Report was -- I cant hear a Syllable of it, nor guess what it is. He is gone from hence.  goes in the Alliance. Remember me to all friends. "
" [Paris,  post 12 May 1780]","My dear Portia The  Dialogue in the Shades  [not found]  was written by Mr. Edmund Jennings now residing at  Brussells, a Native of  Maryland. I will send you the Rest when I can get it. How I lament the Loss of my Packets by Austin! There were I   suppose Letters from Congress of great Importance to me. I know not what I shall do without them. I suppose there was Authority to draw &c. Mr. T.s  [Thaxter] Letter from his father, his hints that Mr. L.  [Henry Laurens?] is coming here. This will be excellent. Since my Arrival this time I have driven about  Paris, more than I did before. The rural Scenes around this Town are charming. The public Walks, Gardens, &c. are  beautifull. The  Gardens of the Palais Royal, the  Gardens of the Tuilleries, are very fine. The  Place de Louis 15, the  Place Vendome or  Place de Louis 14, the  Place victoire, the  Place royal, are fine Squares, ornamented with very magnificent statues. I wish I had time to describe these objects to you in a manner, that I should have done, 25 Years ago, but my Head is too full of Schemes and my Heart of Anxiety to use Expressions borrowed from you know whom. To take a Walk in the  Gardens of the Palace of the Tuilleries, and describe the Statues there, all in marble, in which the ancient Divinities and Heroes are represented with exquisite Art, would be a very pleasant Amusement, and instructive Entertainment, improving in History, Mythology, Poetry, as well as in Statuary. Another Walk in the  Gardens of Versailles, would be  and agreable. But to observe these Objects with Taste and describe them so as  to be understood, would require more time and thought than I can possibly Spare. It is not indeed the fine Arts, which our Country requires. The Usefull, the mechanic Arts, are those which We have occasion for in a young Country, as yet simple and not far advanced in Luxury, altho perhaps much too far for her Age and Character. I could fill Volumes with Descriptions of Temples and Palaces, Paintings, Sculptures, Tapestry, , &c. &c. &c. -- if I could have time. But I could not do this without neglecting my duty. The Science of Government it is my Duty to study, more than all other Studies Sciences: the Art of Legislation and Administration and Negotiation, ought to take Place, indeed to exclude in a manner all other Arts. I must study Politicks and War that my sons may have liberty to study Painting and Poetry Mathematicks and Philosophy. My sons ought to study Mathematicks and Philosophy, Geography, natural History, Naval Architecture, navigation, Commerce and Agriculture, in order to give their Children a right to study Painting, Poetry, Musick, Architecture, Statuary, Tapestry and Porcelaine. "
May 15. 1780,"My dear  I  for your Amusement, a Publication, made here within a few days. Somebody has inserted in the  Amsterdam Gazette, that  lodges with me. This is done with a political design, but whether it was intended to do honour to me, or him or both, I dont know. -- It is not true. -- However there is a good Understanding between him and me, and therefore I did not trouble myself to enquire whether it was done to serve or hurt him or me, or both. I went Yesterday, Pentecost, to  Versailles, and saw the  of the order of St. Esprit. There was magnificence enough. The Queen shone, like a Star -- and the K.  [King] had a new Throne. This striking Character discover by his Countenance, that he had not a very profound Admiration of the Pomposities about him. He manifestly smiled Contempt, upon some of the Ceremonies. But He made a most profound, and reverential Bow to the Altar, when he came up and when he went away. This was done with an Air of real  and Gravity. "

","My dear Portia This day I received  yours of the first of March from  Bilbao , with the journals &c. -- the Postage of this Packet, is prodigious. I would not Advise to send many journals, or Newspapers, this Way, or by  Holland, but cut out pieces of Newspapers, and give me an Account of any Thing particularly interesting in the journals, in your Letters, by such Conveyances, and send large  of Journals and Papers directly to  France. Dont omit any Opportunity of Writing however by  Holland or  Spain. The Communication this Way is more frequent than any other. Your two Sons were at Table, with me, when your Letters arrived, and a feast We had of it indeed. Your Uncle writes me that Babson has arrived, who carried you Letters and Linnen. The same Articles are repeated in Trash. The Alliance, if she ever sails, has all your Affairs and those of our friends on board. I wish them safe. Your account of the brave jacks that I saw at  Corunna, moves me. I saw another such Crew at  Bilbao, who belonged to  , and had the sweet Satisfaction  [to] do them a similar Service. Amidst all my Pains and Heart Achs, I have now and then the Pleasure of doing good a little good, and that is all the Pleasure I have. I wish however it was in my Power to do more for the Numbers of my unfortunate Countrymen, who fall in my Way. The Rogues however, committed a great fault in not calling upon you, to give you an Opportunity of having the same satisfaction. They ought too to have called to let you know, I was ashore, and well.

3 June [1780],"My dear Portia I went a few days ago to see the   or the Mint, the Building where all the Kings Coin is cast and stamped. We viewed all the various Machines, from the first melting of the gold and silver, to the final issuing of the shining  [illegible]  Morsells. The Metal goes thro many Operations that I have not time to describe. There are many Appartements in the Building the Architecture of which is solid and convenient as well as elegant. Their is a noble Reservoir of Water which is conveyed by Pipes to every Appartement. There is a large Well, by which the Reservoir is supplied. I was most entertained however with the Cabinet of Minerals, Metals of all sorts, sulphurs &c., and every Thing that had any Relation to silver and gold. There is a vast Variety -- very curious and in nice order. How should I delight to spend my days in such Enquiries into Nature, if I were not necessitated by every , to devote all my Moments to other Uses. -- I send you an Extract from an English Newspaper, for the Amusement of your Friend.

June 17. 1780,"My dear Portia I yesterday received a Letter of 26 April from Brother Cranch, for which I thank him and will answer as soon as possible. He tells me you have drawn a little Bill upon me. I am sorry for it, because I have sent and should continue to send you, small Presents by which you would be enabled to do better than by drawing Bills. I would not have you draw any more. I will send you Things in the family Way which will defray your  better. The Machine is horribly dear. Mr. C. desires to know if he may draw on me. I wish it was in my power to oblige him but it is not. I have no Remittances nor any Thing to depend on, not a Line from Congress nor any member since I left you. My Expences thro  Spain, were beyond all Imagination, and my Expences here are so exorbitant, that I cant answer any Bill from any body not even from you, excepting the one you have drawn. I must beg you, to be as prudent as possible. Depend upon it, your Children will have Occasion for all your OEconomy. Mr. Johonnot must send me some Bills. Every farthing is expended and more. You can have no Idea of my unavoidable Expences. I know not what to do. Your little affairs and those of all our Friends, Mr. Wibert &c. are on Board the Alliance and have been so these 4 months, or ready to be. -- Pray write me by the Way of  Spain and  Holland as well as  France. We are all well. -- My Duty to your father, my Mother, and affections and Respects where due. My affections I fear got the better of my judgment in bringing my Boys. They behave very well however. London is in the Horrors. --  fell down dead at the first appearance of Mobs. They have been terrible. A Spirit of Bigotry and Fanaticism mixing with the universal discontents of the nation, has broke out into Violences of the most dreadful Nature burnt Lord Mansfields House, Books, Manuscripts -- burnd the  Kings Bench Prison, and all the other Prisons -- let loose all the Debtors and Criminals. Tore to Pieces Sir G. Savilles House -- insulted all the Lords of Parliament &c. &c. Many have been killed -- martial Law proclaimed -- many hanged -- Lord George Gordon committed to the Tower for high Treason -- and where it will end God only knows. -- The Mobs all cryd Peace with  America, and War with  France -- poor Wretches! as if this were possible. In the English Papers they have inserted the Death of Mr. Hutchinson with severity, in these Words -- Governor Hutchinson is no more. On Saturday last he dropped down dead. It is charity to hope that his sins will be buried with him in the Tomb, but they must be recorded in his  Epitaph. His Misrepresentations have contributed to the Continuance of the War with  America. Examples are necessary. It is to be hoped that all will not escape into the Grave, without a previous Appearance, either on a Gibbet or a scaffold.  I am told died last fall. I wish, that with these primary Instruments of the Calamities that now distress almost all the World the Evils themselves may come to an End. For although they will undoubtedly End, in the Welfare of Mankind, and accomplish the Benevolent designs of Providence, towards the two Worlds; Yet for the present they are not joyous but grievous. May  Heaven permit you and me to enjoy the cool Evening of Life, in Tranquility, undisturbed by the Cares of Politicks or War -- and above all with the sweetest of all Reflections, that neither Ambition, nor Vanity, nor Avarice, nor Malice, nor Envy, nor Revenge, nor Fear nor any base Motive, or sordid Passion through the whole Course of this mighty Revolution, and the rapid impetuous Course of great and terrible Events that have attended it, have drawn Us aside from the Line of our Duty and the Dictates of our Consciences! -- Let Us have Ambition enough to keep our Simplicity, or Frugality and our Integrity, and transmit these Virtues as the fairest of Inheritances to our Children. "
June 23. 1780,"My dear Portia We are very much affected with the Loss of Charlestown-it seems the most  Affair, We have ever met with. I dont know that the Consequences will be bad, but the Loss of so many Men, ships, and Artillery and stores is heavy besides the Town. To maintain it, they must weaken themselves at N. York and elsewhere. We hope to hear of something to ballance it. I  a Paper, giving an Account of the Troubles in London. What they will come to, in the End, I dont know. It seems hitherto a fanatical Business. Their civil Liberties, and most essential Interests are forgotten, while they are running mad for their own contracted notions. It is said, that the Catholic Bill will be repealed. The true motive for making that Law, with the Ministry and King, was to engage the Irish Catholicks, on their Side, and get them to inlist into the American service. In the midst of the dismay of these Mobs, comes the News from Charlestown. The Ways of Heaven are dark and intricate, it seems as if they were to be permitted to have Success enough, to lead them on,  they become the most striking Spectacle of Horror that ever was seen. These Riots discover Symptoms of deep distress and misery, among the lower Classes of People. The particular  against the Prisons is one mark of it. The decided Part they took against the Ministry, shews upon what Ground they stand. It is however a Shocking Scaene. The King seems in a fair Way to the Summit of all his wishes, absolute Power. Martial Law is very agreable to him. G[overnor] Hutchinson died in the Beginning of the Affray. Lord Mansfields House underwent a worse Fate, than his. I suppose that it will cost two millions Sterling, to indemnify the Sufferers. This must be added to all the other  of the War. They forget the state of Ireland, France, Spain, West Indies, N. America, the armed Neutrality of the maritime Powers, and their own distracted State, in their joy for the News of Charlestown, which in reality however unpleasant to Us ought to be more dreadful to them, because it will be a Grave to their Army and a drain to their Purses without any considerable Advantage. They however think not of Peace. -- We are all well. "

","My dear  I have ordered the Things you desired for yourself and  by Captain Edward Davis in the Brig Dolphin. They are very dear, as you will see. I insured them at 25 per Cent. The French and Spaniards have at length, made a Hall as the saying is of 40 or 50 ships at once from the English. A few more such strokes will answer a very good End. But not make Peace. This will never be while the English have one soldier in the  United States. We are all well -- thank  for her Letter, and tell Master T. that I should have been obliged to him for one. We are all Impatience to hear from   and the  W. Indies. Proportional good News from thence would make Us very happy. I have been here three or four Weeks, and have spent my time very  here. I am very much pleased with  Holland. It is a singular Country. It is like no other. It is all the Effect of Industry, and the Work of Art. The Frugality, Industry, Cleanliness, &c. here, deserve the Imitation of my Countrymen. The Fruit of these Virtues has been immense Wealth, and great Prosperity. They are not Ambitious, and therefore happy. They are very sociable, however, in their peculiar Fashion. "

","My dear  I wish you to write me, by every Opportunity to this Place, as well as to  France. It seems as if I never should get any more Letters from  America. I have sent you some Things by , but he has no Arms, and I fear they will be lost, by Capture. -- I sent Things by the Alliance. The Country where I am is the greatest Curiosity in the World. This Nation is not known , not even by its Neighbours. The Dutch Language is spoken by none but themselves. Therefore They converse with nobody and nobody converses with them. The English are a great nation, and they despize the Dutch because they are smaller. France is The French are a greater  [illegible]   Nation still, and therefore they despize the Dutch because they are still smaller in comparison to them. But I doubt much whether there is any Nation of  Europe more estimable than the Dutch, in Proportion. Their Industry and  ought to be Examples to the World. They have less Ambition, I mean that of Conquest and military Glory, than their Neighbours, but I dont perceive that they have more Avarice. And they carry Learning and Arts I think to greater Extent. The Collections of Curiosities public and private are innumerable. I am told that  is arrived at  Brest: but I have learned nothing from him as yet -- nor do I know his Destination. The French and Spanish Fleets have made a sweep of Sixty upon the English E. and W. India Fleets. This must have great Effects. We are all well. -- Dont expect Peace. The English have not yet forgot the Acquisition of  , for which they are still making the most childish Exultations. The new Parliament will give Ministry a Run. Mark my Words, You will have no Peace, but what you give yourselves, by destroying Root and Branch all the British Force in  America. The English cannot bear the Thought that  France should dictate the terms of Peace, as they call it. They say they must make a  Peace now -- a shameful Peace, a degrading peace. This is worse than death to them, and thus they will go on, until they are forced to sue for a Peace, still more shamefull and humiliating. "

","My dearest Portia I have this morning sent Mr. Thaxter, with  to Leyden, there to take up their Residence for some time, and there to pursue their Studies of Latin and Greek under the excellent Masters, and there to attend Lectures of the celebrated Professors in that University. It is much cheaper there than here: the Air is infinitely purer; and the Company and Conversation is better. It is perhaps as learned an University as any in Europe. I should not wish to have Children, educated in the common Schools in this Country, where a littleness of Soul is notorious. The Masters are mean Spirited , pinching, kicking, and boxing the Children, upon every Turn. Their is besides a general Littleness arising from the incessant Contemplation of Stivers and Doits, which pervades the whole People. Frugality and Industry are virtues , but Avarice, and Stingyness are not Frugality. The Dutch say that without  thinking of every doit, before you spend it, no Man can be a good Merchant, or conduct Trade with Success. This I believe is a just Maxim in general. But I would never wish to see a Son of Mine govern himself by it. It is the sure and certain Way for an industrious Man to be rich. It is the only possible Way for a Merchant, to become the first Merchant, or the richest Man in the Place. But this is an Object that I hope none of my Children will ever aim at. It is indeed true, , that those who attend to small Expences are always rich. I would have my Children attend to Doits and Farthings as devoutly as the  Dutchman upon Earth, if such Attention was necessary to support their Independence. A Man who discovers a Disposition and a design to be independent seldom succeeds -- a jealousy arises against him. The Tyrants are alarmed on one side least he should oppose them. The slaves are  on the other least he should expose their Servility. The Cry from all Quarters is, ""He is the proudest Man in the World. He cant bear to be under Obligation."" I never in my Life observed any one endeavouring to lay me under particular Obligations to him, but I suspected he had a design to make me his dependant, and to have claims upon my Gratitude. This I should have no objection to -- Because Gratitude is always in ones Power. But the Danger is that Men will expect and require more of Us, than  and Innocence and Rectitude will permit Us to perform. In our Country however any Man with common Industry and Prudence may be .

Tho Green lost the Field on 15 March, it seems Cornwallis must be in a critical situation. I know not what this People will do. I believe they will awake, after some time.  Amsterdam,   and  Dort have represented the Necessity of an Alliance with  America but when the rest will be of their Mind, I know not.  If they neglect it, they and their Posterity will repent of it. The Trade will turn away from this Country to  France and  Spain if the Dutch act so unwise a Part, and indeed, according to every Appearance, this Country will dwindle away to nothing. Other Powers will draw away all its Commerce. By an early Treaty with  America and active Exertions they might save it: but they seem little disposed as yet. My dear  and Tommy how do they do? Our Parents, our Brothers, sisters and all Friends how are they? If I could get back again I would never more leave that Country, let who would beg, scold, or threaten. As to Peace, mark my Words, the English will never make it with Us, while they have a ship or a Regiment in  America. If any one asks whether there is like to be Peace, ask in return, whether G. Washington has taken  New York, Green Cornwallis and  Charlestown, and Nelson Arnold and  Portsmouth? Rodney has lost most of his   Booty. De la Motte Piquet has taken it. The English  East India Possessions seem to be going to wreck -- their Trade is torn to Pieces, but all is not enough. If Congress and the states execute their Resolution of cutting off all Communication and Commerce, directly and indirectly with  America, this will affect them more than any Thing. But how the Authority can prevent British Manufactures from being imported from  France,  Holland,  Brabant &c. Is the Question. Amsterdam in  "

It seized upon my head, in such a manner that for five or six days I was lost, and so insensible to the Operations of the Physicians and surgeons, as to have lost the memory of them. My Friends were so good as to send me an excellent Physician and Surgeon, whose Skill and faithfull Attention with the Blessing of Heaven, have saved my Life. The Physicians Name is Osterdike.

","My dearest Friend Your  of  September 29  and  Oct. 21 . are before me. I avoided saying any Thing about Charles, to save you the Anxiety, which I fear you will now feel in its greatest severity a long time. I thought he would go directly home, in a short Passage, in the best Opportunity which would probably ever present. But I am dissappointed. Charles is at  Bilbao with Major Jackson and Coll. Trumbull who take the best care of his Education as well as his Health and Behaviour. They are to go home in Captain Hill in a good Vessell of 20 Guns. Charles's health was so much affected by this tainted Atmosphere, and he had set his heart so much upon going home in Gillon that it would have broken it, to have refused him. -- I desire I may never again have the Weakness to bring a Child to  Europe. They are infinitely better at home. -- We have all been sick here, myself, Mr. Thaxter, Stephens and another servant, but are all better. Mr. Thaxters Indisposition has been slight and short, mine and Stevens's  [illegible]   long and severe. I beg you would not flatter yourself with hopes of Peace. There will be no such Thing for several years. Dont distress yourself neither about any malicious Attempts to injure me in the Estimation of my Countrymen. Let them take their Course and go the Length of their Tether. They will never hurt your Husband  whose Character is fortified with a shield of Innocence and Honour ten thousandfold stronger than brass or Iron. Their The contemptible Essays made by you know whom, will only tend to their own Confusion. My Letters have shewn them their own Ignorance and Folly, a sight they could not bear. Say as little about it as I do. It has already brought them into the true system and that system is tryumphant. I laugh, and will laugh before all Posterity at their impotent, despicable, ridiculous folly Rage and Envy. They could not help blushing themselves if they were to review their Conduct. Dear  thy Letter  [This letter has not been found.]  does thee much honour. Thy Brother Charles shall teach thee french and Dutch, at home. I wish I could get time to correspond with thee and thy sister, more regularly, but I cannot. I must trust Providence and thine excellent Mamma for the Education of my Children. Mr. Dana and  are well, at  P  [Petersburg]. Hayden has some things for you. Hope he is arrived. I am sorry to learn you have a sum of Paper -- how could you be so imprudent? You must be frugal, I assure you. Your Children will be poorly off. I can but barely live in the manner that is  demanded of me by every Body. Living is dear indeed here. My Children will not be so well left by their father as he was by his. They will be infected with the Examples and Habits and Taste for Expensive Living, without the means. He was not. My Children, shall  never have the smallest soil of dishonour or disgrace brought upon them by their father, no not to please Ministers, Kings, or Nations. At the  of a little of this my Children might perhaps ride at their Ease through Life, but dearly as I love them they shall live in the service of their Country, in her Navy, her Army, or even out of either in the extreamest Degree of Poverty before I will depart in the smallest Iota from my Sentiments of Honour and Delicacy, for I, even I, have sentiments of Delicacy, as exquisite as the proudest Minister that ever served a Monarch. They may not be exactly like those of some Ministers. I beg you would excuse me to my dear Friends, to whom I cannot write so often as I wish. I have  Duties which take up all my time, and require more than I have. General Washington has done me great , and much public service by sending me, authentic Accounts of his own and Gen. Greens last great Actions. They are in the Way to negotiate Peace, it lies wholly with them. No other Ministers but they and their Colleagues in the Army can accomplish the great Event. I am keeping House, but I want an Housekeeper. What a fine Affair it would be if We could flit across the  Atlantic as they say the Angels do from Planet to Planet. I would  dart to  Pens hill and bring you over on my Wings. But alass We must keep house seperately for some time. But one thing I am determined on. If God should please to restore me once more to your fireside, I will never again leave it without your Ladyships Company. No not even to go to Congress at  Philadelphia, and there I am determined to go if I can make Interest enough to get chosen, whenever I return.

I have no certain News, as yet of  Sailing from  Bilbao, but I presume he is sailed. You will have suffered great Anxiety on his Account, but I pray he may arrive safe. I acted for the best when I consented he should go in Gillon, little expecting that he would be landed in  Spain again. Keep him to his studies and send him to Colledge, where I wish his Brother John was. My Health is feeble, but better than it was. I am busy, enough, yet not to much perceptible Purpose as yet. There is no Prospect at all of Peace. Let our People take Care of their Trade and Privateers, next year. They have not much of a Land War to fear. General Washington, has struck the most sublime stroke of all in that Article of the Capitulation, which reserves the Tories for  by their Peers. This has struck Toryism dumb and dead. I expect that all the Rancour of the Refugees will be poured out upon Cornwallis for it. Our  now really stand in a ridiculous Light. They feel it but cannot take the Resolution to be wise. The Romans never saw but one caudine Forks in their whole History. Americans have  the Britains two, in one War. -- But they must do more. Remember, you never will have Peace, while the Britains have a Company of Soldiers at Liberty, within the  United States.  New York must be taken, or you will never have Peace. -- All in good time. The British Army Estimates are the same as last Year, the Navy less by several ships of the Line. What can these People hope for. I fancy the southern states will hold their Heads very high. They have a right. They will scarcely be overrun again I believe, even in the hasty manner of Cornwallis. Burgoine dont seem to be affronted that his Nose is out of joint. He is in good Spirits. Experience has convinced him. -- So I hope it has Cornwallis, that the American War is impracticable. The flour, the Choice of the British Army was with him. The K. of Eng.  consoles his People under all their Disgraces, Disasters, and dismal Prospects, by telling them that they are brave and free. It is a pity for him that he did not allow the Americans to be so Seven Years ago. But the great designs of Providence must be accomplished. Great Indeed! The Progres of Society, will be accellerated by Centuries by this Rev. The Emperor of  Germany is adopting as fast as he can American Ideas of Toleration and religious Liberty, and it will become the fashionable system of all  Europe very soon. Light Spreads from the day Spring in the West, and may it shine more and more until the perfect day. Duty to Parents, Love to Brothers, sisters and Children. It is not in the Power of Worlds to express the Tenderness with which I bid you farewell. "
"Amsterdam  Jany. 4. 1782
","My dearest Friend My Health is returning to me by degrees, and I hope to be fully reestablished by the Help of constant Exercise, and great Care, but I want the Consolations of my family. -- ! When shall I have it.  I presume is sailed in the Cicero from  Bilbao, and John is well with Mr. D.  [Dana] at  Petesbourg. The political Questions here are, a  Peace with  England and the Mediation of  Russia on one Hand and an Alliance with  France,  Spain and  America on the other. The Deliberations will be as long as possible -- and the Result nobody can guess. My Blessing to my Children, Duty to Parents, Affection to Friends, &c. "
"Amsterdam  Jan. 4. 1782
","My dearest Friend I hope,  is at home by this time or that he will be in a few days. I presume he sailed from  Bilbao in the Cicero, with M.  [Major] Jackson and Mr. Trumbul, one of the first days of december yet I have no certain news of his sailing at all. John is well with Mr. D.  [Dana] at  Petersbourg. I cannot tell you any News -- there are great questions upon the Tapis here, but how they will be decided, I know not. -- This Rep.  is a Jilt. When you think you have her Affections, all at once you find you have been deceiv'd. There is not so much as a Talk of a general Peace, nor is there any one who believes in a  Peace bet.  [between]  England and  Holland. Take Care of the War of Ports which the English talk of. Perhaps  Falmouth, perhaps  Rhode Island. Look to Privateers and trade. Let not a Bow be unstrung. There will be, there can be no Peace. I hope Hayden, who had some things for you, is arrived.  Bless I shall not be able to send any thing more I am afraid  next summer. My Blessing to  and Son, my Duty to Parents and Affection to Brothers and Sisters. Pray send me, half a dozen,  N.E. shillings by different Opportunities, if you can find them. "
"Amsterdam  March 22. 1782
","My dearest Friend Your humble Servant has lately grown much into Fashion in this Country. Nobody scarcely of so much importance, as Mynheer Adams. Every City, and Province rings with De Heer Adams &c. &c. &c. and if I were to judge of things here as We do in other Countries, I should think I was going to be received, at  the Hague in  Pomp in a few Weeks. But I never can foresee one hour what will happen. I have had however, great Pleasure to see, that there is a national Attachment to  America, in the Body of this nation  that is well worth cultivating, for there are no Allies more faithfull than they, as has abundantly appeared by their long Suffering with  England. Our Friends at  Petersbourg are well. Pray God  may be with you. I cant conceive what the English will do. They are in a strange Position at present. They cannot do much against  America. But I hope,  America will take their remaining Armies Prisoners in  N.Y. and  Charlestown. We must not relax, but pursue our Advantages. The Proceedings of  Rotterdam, will  you, in the inclosed Paper, the Substance of what all the great Cities in this Republick are doing. Let Mr. Cranch translate it, and print it in the News papers. It is good News. You will have an Abundance of more, which will shew you, that We have not been idle here, but have sown Seeds for a plentifull Harvest. Some Folks will think your Husband, a Negotiator, but it is not he, it is General Washington at  York Town who did the substance of the Work, the form only belongs to me. Oh When shall I see my dearest Friend. -- All in good Time. My dear  blue Hills, ye are the most sublime object in my Imagination. At your reverend Foot, will I spend my old  Age, if any, in a calm philosophical Retrospect upon the turbulent scaenes of Politicks and War. I shall recollect  Amsterdam,  Leyden and  the Hague with more Emotion than  Philadelphia or  Paris. "
29 March 1782,"My dearest Friend The states of  Holland and  West Friesland have resolved,  to admit Mr. Adams to an Audience. The  Papers will shew what is going on here. You will  [hear?] much more of it. -- I have yet no news of Charles's Arrival. John is well -- &c. British Ministry changed. "
April 1. 1782,"My dearest Friend The States of  Holland and  West Friesland have followed the Example of  Friesland, in acknowledging American Independence.  The American Minister rec'd Yesterday officially, from the Grand Pensionary of  Holland a Copy of their Resolution. We have not yet the Mail, with an Account of the new British Ministry,  the last informed Us of a Change. Whether for the better time will shew. I have yet no News of  Arrival. The  French Ambassadors House at the Hague, has been burnt, which I regret very much, more on Account of the Interruption to his Thoughts and Exertions in these critical Moments, than for the Value of the Loss which is however very considerable. The  is an able Minister and my very good Friend. I have bought an House at  the Hague to which I shall remove the 1st. May. Will you come and see me? "
"The Hague  May 14 1782
","My dearest Friend On the Twelfth, I removed into this House which I have purchased for the  United States of America. But, it will be my Residence but a little while. I must go to you or you must come to me. I cannot live, in this horrid Solitude, which it is to me, amidst Courts, Camps and Crowds. If you were to come here, such is the Unsteadiness of the Foundation that very probably We should have to return home again in a Month or six Weeks and  the Atlantick is not so easily passed as  Pens hill. I envy you, your Nabby, Charly and Tommy, and Mr. Dana his Johnny who are very well. A Child was never more weary of a Whistle, than I am of Embassies. The Embassy here however has done great Things.  It has not merely tempted a natural Rival, and an imbittered, inveterate, hereditary Ennemy, to assist a little against  G.B.  [Great Britain] but it has torn from her Bosom, a constant faithfull Friend and Ally of an hundred Years duration. It has not only prevailed with a Minister or an absolute Court to fall in with the national Prejudice: but  it has carried its Cause, by the still small Voice of Reason, and Perswasion, tryumphantly against the uninterrupted Opposition of Family Connections, Court Influence, and Aristocratical Despotism. and It is not a Temple forming a Triple Alliance, with a Nation whose Ruling Family was animated as well as the whole Nation, at that time, with even more Zeal than  in the same Cause. But you will hear all this represented as a Thing of Course, and of little Consequence -- easily done and not worth much. -- Very well!  Jealousy is as cruel as the Grave, and Envy as  as Hell -- and neither have any regard to Veracity or Honour. "
"
Hotel des Etats Unis a la Haye June 16. 1782
","My dearest Friend I find that the Air of  the Hague, and the Return of warm Weather,  later than was ever known, is of great Service to my Health. I mount on Horseback every Morning, and riding is of Use to me. I have not escaped the ""Influenza,"" as they call it, which began in  Russia and has been epidemical, in all  Europe. Mr. Thaxter too has at last submitted to this all subduing Climate and had a Fever, such as  had, but is growing well. You can scarcely imagine a more  Place than  the Hague. Yet no Place has any Charms for me but the  Blue Hills. My Heart will have in it forever, an acking Void, in any other Place. If you and your Daughter were here! But I must turn my Thoughts from such Objects, which always too tenderly affect me, for my repose or Peace of Mind. I am too so wedged in with the Publick Affairs that it is impossible to get away at present. I would transmit a Resignation of all my Employments  but this would occasion much Puzzle and be attended with disagreable Consequences. If I thought it probable I should stay in  Europe a two or three Years, I would certainly request you to come here, but this is opening a scaene of Risque and Trouble for you that I shudder at. -- But all is uncertain. I am not properly informed of what passes in Congress, and I know not their Designs. If they would send out another in my Room it would be the most happy News to me, that ever I heard. The American Cause  has obtained a Tryumph in this Country more signal,  [than] it ever obtained before in  Europe. It was attended with Circumstances, more glorious than could have been foreseen. A Temple, a D'Avaux, a D'Estrates, had more masterly Pens to celebrate their own Negotiations, and Hearts more at Ease, to do it with Care. Your Friend will never have Leisure, he will never have the Patience to describe the Dangers, the Mortifications, the Distresses he has undergone in Accomplishing this great Work. It is better that some of the Opposition and Intrigues he has had to encounter should be buried in Oblivion. After all, it will be represented in  America as a Thing of Course and of no Consequence. Be it so. It is done --  it is worth as much as it is. My dear Nabby and  how do ye? Charles you young Rogue! You had more Wit than all of Us. You have returned to a happy Spot. Study earnestly, go to Colledge and be an Ornament to your Country. Education is better at  Cambridge, than in  Europe. Besides every Child ought to be educated in his own Country. I regret extreamly that his elder Brother is not to have his Education at home. He is well so is his Patron. "
"The Hague  July 1. 1782
","My dearest Friend Your charming Letters of  April 10  and  22d   were brought me, Yesterday. That of 22d is upon Business. Mr. Hill is paid I hope. I will honour your Bill if you draw. But be cautious -- dont trust Money to any Body. You will never have any to lose or to spare. Your Children will want more than you and I shall have for them. The Letter of the 10  I read over and over without End -- and ardently long to be at the  blue Hills, there to pass the Remainder of my feeble days. You would be surprised to see your Friend -- he is much altered. He is half a Century older and feebler than ever you knew him. The Horse that he mounts every day is of service to his Health and the Air of  the Hague is much better than that of  Amsterdam, and besides he begins to be a Courtier, and Sups and Visits at Court among Princesses and Princes, Lords and Ladies of various Nations. I assure you it is much wholesomer to be  a complaisant, good humoured, contented Courtier, than a Grumbletonian Patriot, always whining and snarling. However I believe my Courtierism will never go any great Lengths. I must be an independent Man, and how to reconcile this to the Character of Courtier is the Question. A Line from  Smith of 6. of May makes me tremble for my Friend and Brother Cranch! I must hope he is recoverd. I can tell you no News about Peace. There will be no  Peaces made, not even by  Holland -- and I cannot think that the present English Ministry are firm enough in their Seats to make a general Peace, as yet. When shall I go home? If a Peace should be made, you would soon see me. -- I have had strong Conflicts within, about resigning all my Employments, as soon as I can send home a Treaty. But I know not what is duty as our Saints say. It is not that my Pride or my Vanity is piqued by the Revocation of my envied Commission. But in such Cases, a  Man knows not what Construction to put. Whether it is not intended to  make him resign. Heaven knows I never solicited to come to  Europe. Heaven knows too what Motive I can have, to banish my self from a Country, which has given me, unequivocal Marks of  [its] Affection, Confidence and Esteem, to encounter every Hardship and every danger by Sea and by Land, to ruin my Health, and to suffer every Humiliation and Mortification that human Nature can endure. What affects me most is the  given to Wrong against Right, to Vice against Virtue, to Folly vs. Wisdom, to Servility against Independance, to base and vile Intrigue against inflexible Honour and Integrity. This is saying a great deal, but it is saying no little more than Congress have said upon their Records, in approving that very Conduct for which I was sacrificed. -- I am sometimes afraid that it is betraying the Cause of Independence and Integrity or at least the Dignity, which they ought to maintain, to continue in the service. But on the other Hand I have thought, whether it was not more dangerously betraying this Dignity, to give its Ennemies, perhaps the compleat Tryumph which they wished for and sought but could not obtain. You will see, the American Cause has had a signal  in this Country. If this had been the only Action of my Life, it would have been a Life well spent. I see with Smiles and Scorn, little despicable Efforts to deprive me of the Honour of any Merit, in this Negotiation, but I thank God, I have enough to shew. No Negotiation to this or any other Country was every recorded in greater detail, as the World will one day see. The Letters I have written in this Country, are carefully preserved. The Conversations I have had are remembered. The Pamphlets, the Gazettes, in Dutch and French, will  to Posterity, when it comes to be known what share I have had in them as it will be it will be seen that the Spanish Ambassador expressed but the litteral Truth, when He said Pardon a Vanity, which however is conscious of the Truth, and which has a right to boast, since the most Sordid Arts and the grossest Lies, are invented and propagated, by Means that would disgrace the Devil, to disguise the Truth from the sight of the World. I laugh at this, because I know it to be impossible. Silence! "
"Hague  25 July 1782
","My dearest Friend In this Country, as in all others, Men are much Addicted to ""Hobby Horses."" These Nags are called in the Language of the Dutch ""Liefhebbery,"" as they are called in French ""Marotte."" I had rather ride a Dutch Hobby Horse than an English one or a French. It is the wholesomest Exercise in the World. They live to great Ages by the Strength of it. My Meaning is this. They pitch in early Life upon some  Amusement, which they follow all their days at Leisure hours. I shall give you the History of several. I Yesterday made a Visit to one, a , a venerable old Man of 75, in full Health, Strength and Vivacity, respectable for several Offices which he holds, but more so for vast learning in various Kinds, and great Ingenuity. His Hobby Horse has been natural Knowledge. We went to see a Collection of marine Shells. We were two hours, and had not got half through. The infinite Variety of Figures and Coulours, is astonishing. But his Curiosity has not been confined to Shells. It has extended to Insects, and he has had it in Contemplation to write as full an Account of these as Buffon has written of Birds, Beasts and Fishes. But beginning with Caterpillars, he has filled a Folio upon that Species -- and drew, and engraved the Plates himself. Thus he rode his Hobby Horse  and lived. Without it, he would have died fifty Years ago. Have you an Inclination to read and inspect  of the Anatomy of Caterpillars -- their Nerves, Blood, Juices, Bones, Hair, Senses, Intellects &c. &c. -- Their moral Sense, their Laws, Government, Manners and Customs. I dont know whether he teaches the manner of destroying them, and Saving the Apple tree. I doubt not the Book is worth studying. All Nature is so. -- But I have too much to do, to Study Men, and their mischievous Designs upon Apple Trees and other Things, ever to be very intimate with , (whom I respect very much however) or his Book.  "
" [The Hague,  ca. 15 August 1782]","My dearest Friend  is getting better and Mr. Charles Storer is now with me, and We may be all now said to be pretty well. Our northern Friends are well too. You will hear a great deal about Peace, but dont trust to it. Remember what I have often said ""We shall not be able to obtain Peace, while our  have  New York and  Charlestown or either of them."" I know the Character and Sentiments of the King of  England, and while he can hold a Post in the  United States, he will have it in his Power to make the People of  England believe that the People of  America love him and them, and keep up their hopes of some turn of Affairs in their favour. Lord Shelburnes System is equivocal. Fox has seized the right Idea. But the former will run down the latter for sometime. Yet the Plan of the latter must finally prevail. It is deeply laid and well digested. If he has Perseverance he will be the Man to make Peace. By frequent Exercise on Horseback and great Care, I seem to have recovered my Health, strength and Spirits beyond my Expectations. And if the Company of Princes and Princesses, Dukes and , Comtes and Comptesses could make me happy, I might easily be so but my Admired Princess is at  the blue Hills, where all my Ambition and all my Wishes tend. I know not the Reason but there is some Strange Attraction between the  North Parish in Braintree and my Heart. It is a remarkable Spot. It has vomited Forth more Fire than  Mount Etna. It has produced three mortals, Hancock and two Adams's, who have, with the best Intentions in the World, set the World in a blaze. I say two Adams's because the  sprung from thence as his father was born there. -- Glorious however as the flame is, I wish I could put it out. -- Some People say I was born for such Times. It is true I was born to be in such times but was not made for them. They affect too tenderly my Heart. I love the People where I am. They have Faults but they have deep Wisdom and great Virtues -- and they love  America, and will be her everlasting Friend, I think. I would do a great deal to serve this nation, I own. If  Spain should acknowledge Us as I think she will soon, the two great Branches of the House of Bourbon , Holland and  America, will form a Phalanx which will not easily be shaken. I hope  We shall continue Friends. If We do, whenever  England makes Peace She will be afraid to quarrell with Us, how much soever she may hate Us. And I think the other Powers of  Europe too will prefer our Friendship to our Enmity, and will choose to excuse Us from meddling in future Wars. This is the Object of all my Wishes and the End of all my Politicks. To this End and for this Reason I look upon my success in  Holland as the happiest Event, and the greatest Action of my Life past or future. I think that no Opportunity will present itself for a Century to come, for Striking a Stroke so critical and of so extensive Importance, in the political system of  America. How critical it has been few Persons know. It has hung upon a Thread, a Hair, a silken Fibre. Its Consequences will not be all developed for Centuries. I know there are  [those] who represent it a Thing of Course and of trifling moment. But they have not seen the Diary of Mr. Van beckel, nor mine, nor the Minutes of the Cabinets of Orange and Brunswick. Nor have they seen the History of future Wars in  Europe. A future War in  Europe will shew the Importance, of the American Negotiation in  Holland. -- Be discreet in the Use you make of this. Be cautious. I want to know how our Success here is relished with you. "
August 17 1782,"My dearest Friend Your  of June 17.  arrived this Day and gave me, all the tender and melancholly Feelings of which my Heart is susceptible. How shall I express my solicitude for my amiable, my venerable Friend and ? This World contains not a wiser or a more virtuous Man. Just now placed in a situation, too where all his great Talents and excellent Virtues might have their full Effect! -- But it is but a Part that We see. I tremble for his Family. Possibly he may still be spared. But We must all expect. -- I have been within an Hairs Breadth, and although recovered to tolerable Halth and Spirits, I am still feeble, and shall never be restored to all my former Force. Before this Time, you will have learned our full Success here. The Treaty is not yet  but it is in a fair Way. This Nation cannot depart  from its Forms, and it takes a long time for a Treaty to undergo the Examination of so many Provinces and Cities. But this Nation will stand firm. I am now happy in the Intimacy of many leading Characters and know their Views and Designs very well and We may depend upon their steady Attachment to Us and to the good System. You have not yet an Idea of all the Difficulties I have had to encounter. Some of them ought not to be committed to Paper. They were cruel, but I bore them and they are over. I am now as  situated as I can ever be without my Family. It is to me an insipid Life, this of an Ambassador, and I wish it at an End. . . . The naval Disaster you mention, has no ill Effect upon this People. My dear Children are never long out of my Thoughts. Where is  Pen? I hear sometimes of Miss Nabby in  Boston. How is Mr. Tommy? Our Northern Friends are well. "
August 17. 1782,"My dearest Friend The Situation of , at the date of  yours 17 June , has allarmed me so much that I dread to hear any further News of him. An Affection for him has grown old with me as it commenced very early in Life has and has constantly increased. Mr. Smiths Letter of 6 of May did not surprise me so much because I had often known him in great distress in the Lungs but these disorders are new. The World has scarcely a worthier Man to loose. My Friends may think strange that they dont receive Letters from me oftener. I believe they think I have a great deal of Leisure. I wish I could change Situations with them, and then they would see what a pretty Thing it is to be an American Minister. I am not idler than I used to be. My whole Time is spent in necessary and unavoidable Services. The Silk Machine is not more complicated nor more delicate than the System of  of the  United States  [i.e. the United Provinces]. It extends its Branches into every Court and Country of  Europe. In order to know what it is they must come and see and try the Experiment. -- I am weary of it. -- I am no more able to maintain all the Correspondences I have than to remove mountains. I am obliged to sacrifice my Friendships as well as my other Affections to my Duty. Mr. T. [Thaxter] has been sick this 2 or 3 months, which has made the Burthen heavier for me, indeed too much for my feeble Frame. He is now pretty well. If I should be obliged to go to  Paris or  Vienna, to talk about Peace, another Scaene of Pleasure and Amusement would open upon me, such as I have had a long succession of. Such Pleasure and Amusement as millions of Perplexities, and millions of  Humiliations and Mortifications aford. All of them however have not yet subdued my proud heart. I have nothing to do but pray for the abundant Outpowerings of Patience, Patience, Patience. A good Peace would be a Reward for all. I dont know how it is -- I suppose it is my Vanity. But I was under no Fears of a bad Peace, while I was alone. I was very sure of my own Firmness or call it Obstinacy, if you will. I had no jealousies, no Suspicions, no Misgivings. I cannot say the same now. I have a good Opinion, however, of , and wish I could have of the other. Yet if I had known that Mr. Jefferson would not have come and Mr. Laurens resigned, I would have refused to share in the new Commission. I shall do the best I can. -- Adieu. "
Aug 31. 1782,"All well. -- You will send these Papers to some Printer when you have done with them. We have found that the only Way of guarding against Fevers is to ride. We accordingly mount our Horses every day. But the Weather through the whole Spring and most of the Summer has been very dull, damp, cold, very  and dangerous. But shaking on Horseback guards pretty well against it. I am going to Dinner with a Duke and a  and a Number  [of] Ambassadors and Senators, in all the Luxury of this luxurious World: but how much more luxurious it would be to me, to dine upon roast Beef with Parson Smith, Dr. Tufts or Norton Quincy -- or upon rusticrat Potatoes with Portia -- Oh! Oh! hi ho hum! -- and her Daughter and sons. "
"Hague  Sept 17 1782
","My dearest Friend I have transmitted Money to the young Men, whom you mentioned to me, and have expected every day for a long time to hear of their Sailing in a Cartel for  America. They have been better treated since the Change of Ministers. My Respects to their Parents. It is now five Months since my  Reception here but We have not yet learned, that any News of it, has arrived in  America. The Refugees in  England are at their old Game again. Andrew Sparhawk has published in the Morning Post, that his Brother has received a Letter from  New York, that  Massachusetts and several other States were upon the Point of overturning the new Government, and throwing off the Authority of Congress, and returning to the Government of  G. Britain. Their blood thirsty Souls are not yet satiated. They are  to bring on again an offensive War. But I think they cant succeed. I suppose the unhappy Affair of the  County of Hampshire, is the Thing which gave Occasion to this Representation. Our Countrymen, must be very unreasonable if they cant be easy and happy under the Government they have. I dont know where they will find a better -- or how they will make one. I dread, the Consequences of the Differences between Chiefs. If  Massachusetts gets into Parties, they will worry one another, very rudely. But I rely upon the honesty and Sobriety as well as good sense of the People. These Qualities will overawe the Passions of Individuals, and preserve a Steady Administration of the Laws. My Duty to , and to your Father. I hope to see them again. Love to the Children and all Friends. What shall I say of my Brother Cranch? I long and yet I dread to hear from him. I hope to sign the Treaty, this Week or next or the Week after. All Points are agreed on, and nothing remains but to transcribe the Copies fair. This Government is so complicated, that Months are consumed in doing what might be done in another in an hour. I dont know what to do with the Lists of Articles you send me. It would be better for you to write to Ingraham and Bromfield. I will pay. "
Sept. 24. 1782,"My dearest Friend The  Stick at nothing. The Paragraphs in the enclosed Paper, which respect me, are impudent Forgeries. So far from thinking that the French never meant to treat, I have been long of opinion that the English never meant to treat, and that the French, from the Sincerity of their Desire to treat, have given a too ready Attention to Maneuvres of the English which have been only insidious Hypocrisies. There have been many other Paragraphs in the  London Papers respecting me, equally false, shameless and abominable -- and probably will be many more. You see too, they begin to abuse , more than they used to do, for his just Friendship to  France. Billy Walter and the two Sparhawks have made themselves ridiculous enough, by their Attempts to propagate an Opinion, that the  Massachusetts was wavering. It is a long time indeed, since We have any News from  America. We have not yet  that you had any News of our Acknowledgment here, on the 19 of April, now more than five Months. Dont be too sanguine in your Expectations of Peace. I see no Probability of it, before 1784. . . We shall not find it, this Winter. The English will have another , unless there should come from the  East and West Indies,  North America, and  Gibraltar, better News for Us, than and more disastrous for them, than I expect. There is nothing, but their Finances, which will dispose them to Peace, and I fancy, they will find Ways to get Money for one feeble  more. I call it feeble for such it must be, with all their Exertions. We read in the Gazettes of Motions in  Poland, and upon the Frontiers of  Turkey and  Russia, but I dont see a Probability of a War breaking out. If there should, I dont see how it can hurt Us. The English however seem to flatter themselves with Hopes, that by persevering, they may give an Opportunity to Time to ripen into Existence, conjunctures, now only in . They talk of a different Posture of Things on  the Continent, which may cutt out Work, for the Bourbon Family nearer home. These however are only the Ravings of the Refugees in  and Despair. Such Conjunctures are to give Time to  England to blott out the Navies of  France and  Spain, and after that bring  America to Reason. How many Years will this require. And how are their Taxes to be paid and Supplies to be raised? In short if our Country men are Steady, the British Delusion cannot last much longer. If Americans go to playing Pranks, and furnishing their  in  Europe, especially in  England, especially the Refugees, with Arguments, and Hopes, it may be protracted some Years. The People of  England is now so much awakened, and the American War is so unpopular, and there is so strong a Party for Acknowledging our Independence without Conditions, that a little ill Success would turn the Scale. The Loss of  Gibraltar, the Loss of  Jamaica, the Loss of a naval Battle, any remarkable Disadvantage in the  East Indies, the Loss of the  Jamaica or  Balic Fleet. The Difference between the State of the English and their Ennemies is this -- any unfavourable Event would compleat their Discouragement and unite a Majority in an Acknowledgment of our Independence. Whereas many great Disasters would not induce their Ennemies to give it up. "

Saturday 12 Oct. 1782  at the Hague","My dearest Friend I believe I shall set off for  Paris next . Mr. Thaxter and Mr. Storer will go with me.

It Seems to me, that I have had rather more   [than] he, and have got thro them. I am now going to  Paris, to another Furnace of Affliction. Yet I am very gay, more so than usual. I fear nothing. Why should I. I had like to have Said nothing worse can happen. But this is too much. Heaven has hitherto preserved my Country and my Family. I have Sent you an whole Piece of most excellent and beautiful Scarlet Cloth -- it is very Saucy. 9 florins almost a Guinea a Dutch ell, much less than an English Yard. I have sent some blue too very good. Give  a suit of Cloths if you will or keep enough for it some years hence and yourself and Daughter a Ridinghood in honour of the Manufactures of  Haerlem. The Scarlet is ""crois e"" as they call it. You never saw such a Cloth. I send also a Suit of Curtains for Miss Nabby. As to her request it will be long Ad referendums There is also a Remnant of Silk, Green. Make the best of all -- but dont meddle any more with  Vermont. If We make Peace, you will see me next summer. But I have very little faith as yet. I am most  to think there will be another Campaign. I am exceedingly  of late by the French and Spanish Ambassadors. I never know how to close, because I can never express the Tenderness I feel. "
"Hague  Oct. 16. 1782
","My dearest Friend Yesterday arrived your kind Letters of  the 3  and  5 of september . I am preparing to  off tomorrow Morning for  Paris, so that I am unable to write you more than a Line. Your Proposal of coming to me would make me the happiest of Men, if it were probable that I should live here where I am well settled. But, if the Negotiations for Peace should take a serious Turn, I shall be obliged to live in furnished Lodgings at  Paris, or to travel 600 or 800 miles farther to  Vienna. These journeys would be  disagreable to you and your Daughter -- and for you to live at  the Hague while I am running about  Europe, would be more disagreable than in  America. If Peace should be made this Winter I intend to go home in the Spring. I shall however be able to form a better judgment at  Paris from whence I will write more fully. Dont conclude from my journey to  Paris that Peace will be made. The Dutch Ministers at  Paris have written that  has received Instructions to treat with the Ministers of the  United states of America. Mr. Jay has written me, that Mr. Oswald has received a Commission to treat with the  United states of America. But he enjoins me secrecy about it so that you must keep it to yourself. He will write it to Congress from  Paris, I suppose. I shall write fully from thence as soon as I know the Truth, but I dare not write half Intelligence, about such delicate Points. Thanks to  for his Letter which I would answer if I had time. Rejoice with Brother Cranch and family.  enterprising Duty and Affection most tenderly moves me, but she little thinks of the Dangers and Difficulties she wishes to encounter. I have not received the Letter containing your Proposals So I cannot give you my Opinion of it fully. "
"Paris  November 8. 1782
","My dearest Friend The , by a Commission under the great Seal of his Kingdom, has constituted Richard Oswald Esqr. his Commissioner to treat with the Ministers Plenipotentiary of the  United States of America, and has given him full Powers which have been mutually exchanged. Thus  G.B. has Shifted Suddenly about, and from persecuting Us with unrelenting Bowells, has unconditionally and unequivocally acknowledged Us a Sovereign State and independant Nation. It is surprizing that she should be the third Power to make this Acknowledgment. She has been negotiated into it, for Jay and I peremptorily refused to Speak or hear, before We were put upon an equal Foot. Franklin as usual would have taken the Advice of the C. [Comte] de V.  [Vergennes] and treated, without, but nobody would join him. As to your coming to  Europe with , I know not what to say. I am obliged to differ in Opinion so often from Dr. Franklin and the C. de Vergennes, in Points that essentially affect the Honour Dignity and most prescious Interests of my Country, and these Personages are so little disposed to bear Contradiction, and Congress have gone so near enjoining upon me passive Obedience to them, that I do not expect to hold any Place in  Europe longer than next Spring. Mr. Jay is in the Same Predicament, and So will every honest Man be, that Congress can Send. Write however to  in Congress and desire him candidly to tell you, whether he thinks Congress will continue me in  Europe, upon Terms which I can Submitt to with honour, another Year. If he tells you as a Freind that I must Stay another Year, come to me, in the Spring with your Daughter. Leave the Boys in good Hands and a good school. A Trip to  Europe, for one Year may do no harm to you or your Daughter. The Artifices of the Devil will be used to get me out of the Commission for Peace. If they succeed I abandon  Europe for ever, for the  Blue Hills without one Instants Loss of Time or even waiting for Leave to return.  For whoever is Horse jockeyed, I will not be. -- Congress means well, but is egregiously imposed upon and deceived.   "
"Paris  December 4. 1782
","My dearest Friend Your Proposal of coming to  Europe, has long and tenderly affected me. The Dangers and Inconveniences are such and an European Life would be so  to you that I have suffered a great deal of Anxiety in reflecting upon it. And upon the whole, I think it will be most for the Happiness of my Family, and most for the Honour of our Country that I should come home. I have therefore this Day written to Congress a Resignation of all my Employments, and as soon as I shall receive their Acceptance of it, I will embark for  America, which will be in the Spring or beginning of Summer. Our Son is now on his journey from  Petersbourg through  Sweeden  Denmark and  Germany, and if it please God he come safe, he shall come with me, and I pray We may all meet once more, you and I never to Seperate again.

","My dearest Friend I dare Say there is not a Lady in  America treated with a more curious dish of , than is contained in the inclosed Papers. You may Shew them to discrete Friends, but by no means let them go out of your hands or be copied. Preserve them in Safety against Accidents. I am afraid We shall have another Campaign: but do not  however of a Peace this Winter.  America has nothing to do but be temperate, patient, and faithfull to her Ally. This is as clearly her Duty as it is her Interest. She could not trust  England, if her Honour was not engaged to  France which it is most certainly. And when this is Said, all is Said. Whether there should be Peace or War, I shall come home in the Summer. As Soon as I shall receive from Congress their Acceptance of the Resignation of all my Employments which I have transmited, many Ways, I Shall embark. And you may depend upon a good domestic husband, for the remainder of my Life, if it is the Will of Heaven that I should once more meet you. My Promises are not lightly made with any body. I have never broken one made to you, and I will not begin at this time of Life. My Children I hope will once at length discover, that they have a Father, who is not  of their Welfare. They have had too much Reason to think themselves forgotten, although I know that an Anxiety for their happiness has corroded me, every day of my Life. With a Tenderness which Words cannot express I am theirs and yours forever. "

","My dearest Friend The Preliminaries of Peace and an Armistice, were Signed at  Versailles on the 20 and on the 21. We went again to pay our Respects to the King and Royal Family upon the Occasion. Mr. Jay was gone upon a little Excursion  of  Normandie and Mr. Laurens was gone to  Bath, both for their health, so that the signature was made by Mr. Franklin and me. I want an Excursion too. Thus drops the Curtain upon this mighty  It has unravelled itself happily for Us. And Heaven be praised. Some of our dearest Interests have been saved, thro many dangers. I have no News from my son, Since the 8th. december, when he was at  Stockholm, but hope every hour to hear of his Arrival at the  Hague. I hope to receive the Acceptance of my Resignation So as to come home in the Spring Ships. I had written thus far when  yours of 23   was brought in. Its Contents have awakened all my sensibility, and shew in a stronger Light than ever the Necessity of my coming home. I confess I don't like the Subject at all. My Child is too young for such Thoughts, and I dont like your Word ""Dissipation"" at all. I dont know what it means, it may mean every Thing. There is not Modesty and Diffidence enough in the Traits you Send me. My Child is a Model, as you represent her and as I know her, and is not to be the Prize, I hope of any, even reformed Rake.  A Lawyer would be my Choice, but it must be a Lawyer who spends his Midnights as well as Evenings at his Age over his Books not at any Ladys Fire side. I Should have thought you had seen enough to be more upon your Guard than to write Billets upon such a subject to such a youth. A Youth who has been giddy enough to Spend his Fortune or half his Fortune in Gaieties, is not the Youth for me, Let his Person, Family, Connections and Taste for Poetry be what they will. I am not looking out for a Poet, nor a Professor of belle Letters. In the Name of all that is tender dont criticise  for those qualities which are her greatest Glory her Reserve, and her Prudence which I am amazed to hear you call want of Sensibility. The more Silent She is in Company, the better for me in exact Proportion and I would have this observed as a Rule by the Mother as well as the Daughter. You know moreover or ought to know my utter Inability to do  for my Children, and you know the long dependence of young Gentlemen of the most promising Talents and obstinate Industry, at the Bar. My Children will have nothing but their Liberty and the Right to catch Fish, on the Banks of  Newfoundland. This is all the Fortune that I have been able to make for myself or them. I know not however, enough of this subject to decide . Is he a Speaker at the Bar? If not he will never be any Thing. But above all I positively forbid, any Connection between my Daughter and any Youth upon Earth, who does not totally eradicate every Taste for Gaiety   and Expence. I never knew one who had it and indulged it, but what was made a Rascall by it, sooner or later.  has had a Brother in  Europe, and a detestible Specimen he exhibited. Their Father had not all those nice sentiments which I wish, although an Honourable Man. I think he and you have both advanced too fast, and I should advise both to retreat. Your Family as well as mine have had too much Cause to rue, the Qualities which by your own Account have been in him. And if they were ever in him they are not yet out. This is too Serious a Subject, to equivocate about. I dont like this method of Courting Mothers. There is something too fantastical and affected in all this Business for me. It is not nature, modest, virtuous, noble nature. The Simplicity of Nature is the best Rule with me to judge of every Thing, in Love as well as State and War. This is all between you and me. I would give the World to be with you Tomorrow. But there is a vast Ocean. No . But I have not yet Leave from my Masters. I dont love to go home in a Miff, Pet or Passion nor with an ill Grace, but I hope Soon to have leave. I can never Stay in  Holland -- the Air of that Country chills every drop of Blood in My Veins. If I were to stay in  Europe another Year I would insist upon your coming with your daughter but this is not to be and I will come home to you. "
"Paris  January 29. 1783.
","My dearest Friend Your kind Letters of Oct. 25.  and November 13  came to hand but . A Packet from you is always more than I can bear. It gives me a great Pleasure, the highest Pleasure, and therefore makes me and Leaves me Melancholly, like the highest Strains in Music. I have written you many times and Ways, that I have written to Congress a Resignation, and that I expect the Acceptance of it by the first ships, and will embark for home as soon as it arrives. There is a Possibility that one Case may happen, vizt. that Congress may accept my Resignation, and send me at the same time a Renewal of my old Commission to make a Treaty of Commerce with  Great Britain. There is not in my Opinion the least Probability of this, nor do I desire it, the first desire of my Soul being to go home. But if it should happen, I beg you would come to me with it, for nothing but your Company will make it acceptable. However brillant a Feather it might be in my Cap, to make a Treaty of Commerce with  G. Britain, and how much  malicious Wits may suppose me disappointed by the Extraordinary Resolution of Congress which took from me a distinction, which I had dearly earned by accepting and attempting to execute a Commission which they had given me with so much Unanimity and without any solicitation   of mine, yet I assure you I think I can be employed more agreably to my self in  America, if not more usefully to the Public. However this may be my Resolution is fixed, to return home unless Congress should restore me my , whether they accept of my Resignation or not.  take care how you dispose of your Heart. -- I hoped to be at home and to have chosen a Partner for you. Or at least to have given you some good Advice before you should choose. If I mistake not your Character it is not Gaiety and Superficial Accomplishments alone that will make you happy. It must be a thinking Being, and one who thinks for others good and feels anothers Woe. It must be one who can ride 500 miles upon a trotting Horse and cross the  stream with a steady Heart. One may dance or sing, play or ride, without being good for much. But I must conclude, by my Wishes and Prayers for your Direction in all Things, and by assuring you that no Words can express the Feelings of my Heart, when I subscribe myself Yours forever. "

","My dearest Friend Your two Letters concerning  [Tyler]   are never out of my Mind. He is of a very numerous Family and Connection in  Boston who have long had great Influence in that Town and therefore if his Education has been regular to the Bar, as it must have been if he followed his Studies regularly, under two Such Masters as Mr. Dana and Mr. Angier, if he has been admitted and Sworn with the Consent and Recommendation of the Bar, and if he has Health Talents, and Application and is a Speaker, his Relations will easily introduce him to full Business. But I dont like the Trait in his Character, his Gaiety. He is but a Prodigal Son, and though a Penitent, has no Right to , who deserves a Character without a Spot. That Frivolity of Mind, which breaks out into Such Errors in Youth, never gets out of the Man but Shews itself in some mean Shape or other through Life. You seem to me to have favoured this affair much too far, and I wish it off. Nevertheless, I cannot judge, you have not furnished me with Facts enough for the Purpose.  I must Submit, my Daughters Destiny, to Her own judgment and her own Heart, with your Advice and the Advice of our Parents and Brothers and sisters and Uncles and Aunts &c. You must endeavour to know the Opinion of the Family, and I pray a kind Providence to protect My Child. I had flattered myself with the Hopes of a few Years of the society of , at her Fathers House. But if it must be otherwise I must Submit. I am So uneasy about this Subject, that I would come instantly home, if I could with decency. But my Dutch Treaty is not yet exchanged, I have not yet taken Leave of their High Mightinesses, nor of the Court, nor have I yet signed all the Obligations for the Loan: So that I dont See how I can possibly, come home without first returning to the  Hague. There are other Subjects too about which I am not on a Bed of Roses. The Revocation of my Commission to make a Treaty of Commerce with G. Britain without assigning any Reason, is an affront to me and a Stain upon my Character that I will not wear one Moment longer than is indispensably necessary for the public Good. And therefore I will come home, whether my Resignation is accepted or not, unless my  is restored. This can be but one Way, in  Europe, and that is by Sending me a Renewal of the Commission. This I have no Idea will be done: because the Forest is laid wide open for the Game and all the Hounds of Faction will be let loose at the Halloo of the Sportsman. I will have no share in the Chase.  I am weary to death of a Residence in  Europe, and so would you be. You have no Idea of it.Mrs. Jay can tell you. This Lady is as weary as is possible, and you would be more so. If it were only an Affair of myself and my Family, I would not accept a Commission if sent. But I consider it a public Point of . An infamous Attack has been made upon me, only Doing my Duty, or rather an Attack has been made upon the Fisheries, the Missisippi and the Western Lands, through my Sides. I have totally defeated the Attack upon those Great Objects and I Say the Honour the Dignity and future Safety of the  United States depend are interested in restoring that Commission to me, that future Attacks of the same Kind may be discouraged, and future Servants of the Publick protected. And I have Sworn that justice Shall be done in this Case somehow or other. The Public Voice shall pronounce the Righteous sentence, if Congress does not. If therefore Congress should renew my Commission to  make a Treaty of Commerce with  G. B., come to me, with your Daughter if she is not too much engaged, and master Tommy. Send Charles to his Uncle Shaw or some school and let any Body draw upon me for his support. I do not however believe, Congress will send me such a Commission, and if not I shall have my Daughter by her Hand before she gives it away, at the Blue Hills at the latest by Mid summer. Endeavour to learn what passes upon the subject in Congress and write it to me for my Guidance. You may write by Way of  England,  Holland,  France or  Spain. Send under Cover however to some other Friend. I Shall Send  home to Colledge, I believe. Bring him certainly with me if I come, as I expect and hopes Yours forever. "

Dont think therefore of coming to  Europe. If you do We Shall cross each other, and I shall arrive in  America about the Same time that you may arrive in  Europe.

","My dearest Friend ""A Court,"" as John Dryden informed me, before Experience,  ""is a place of forgetfulness for well deservers. It is infectious even to the best Morals to live always in it. It is a dangerous Commerce where an honest Man is sure at the first of being cheated; and he recovers not his losses, but by learning to cheat others. The undermining Smile becomes at length habitual; and the drift of his plausible Conversation is only to flatter one, that he may betray another. Yet it is good to have been a Looker on, without venturing to play; that a Man may know false Dice another Time,  he never means to use them. I commend not him who never knew a Court, but him who forsakes it because he knows it."" Experience has not only given me an Understanding but a feeling of these Observations. I am so disgusted at all Courts, that I long to get away from all of them; and however unpromising and melancholy my Prospects are for myself and Family, in retirement, I had rather take my Chance in it, than remain at any Court in the World. I can live upon a little and teach my Children to do so too as yet, while they have no Habits of : but those Habits once changed, Adieu to all Happiness both for them and me. I am so bent upon coming home; that it would be a cruel Disappointment to me, to be obliged to stay another Year in  Europe, which is a possible and but barely a possible Case. Congress, in Complaisance to a Frenchman, revoked my Commission to the King of Great Britain, and the  same Complaisance continuing they will appoint some other Person to that important Mission, or will delay appointing any one. But if Congress should think the Honor, Dignity and most important Interests of the  United States concerned in an immediate Restoration of that Commission to me, I cannot in honor, and I ought not, from Regard to the Publick, to refuse it. But Faction, Finesse and Intrigue, which first took away the Commission, will no doubt continue to keep it away. I shall therefore certainly come home. If my Resignation is not accepted, but is drawn out into length, I must come home of my own head -- for my Family at all Events I must and will join  J'ai besoin d'etre Pere, as King Lear says . Even if Congress should restore my Commission to  Great Britain, don't You think of coming till You hear from me, because I shall probably be going home while You are coming here, and We shall miss each other. I have lived too long without my Family for the Health of my Body or Mind, and God willing the  shall come to an End. "

","My dearest Friend Dryden, whom I have always loved to read now and then, because I learn something from him, informs me, if I did not know it before, that  ""it hath been observed in former times that none have been so greedy of Employments, and of managing the , as they who have least deserved their Stations. But such only merit to be called Patriots, under whom We see their  Country flourish. I have laughed sometimes, when I have reflected on those Men, who from time to time have shot themselves into the World. I have seen many successions of them; some bolting out upon the Stage with vast applause, and others hissed off, and quitting it with disgrace. But while they were in Action, I have constantly observed, that they seemed desirous to retreat from Business -- Greatness they said was nauseous, and a Crowd was troublesome; a quiet Privacy was their Ambition. Some few of them I believe said this in earnest, and were making a Provision against Futurity, that they might enjoy their Age with Ease. They saw the happiness of private Life, and promised to themselves a Blessing which every day it was in their Power to possess. But they deferred it, and lingered still at Court, because they thought they had not yet enough to make them happy. They would have more, and laid in to make their Solitude luxurious. A wretched Philosophy, which Epicurus never taught them in his Garden: they loved the prospect of this quiet in Reversion, but were not willing to have it in Possession. They would first be old, and made as sure of Health and Life, as if both of them were at their dispose. But put them to the Necessity of a present Choice, and they preferred Continuance in Power, like the Wretch who called Death to his Assistance, but refused him when he came. The great Scipio was not of their Opinion, who indeed sought Honors in his Youth, and endured the fatigues with which he purchased them. He served his Country, when it was in need of his Courage and Conduct, until he thought it was time to serve 
Page 3
 himself: but dismounted from the Saddle, when he found the Beast which bore him began to grow restif and ungovernable."" I have constantly and severely felt this desire to retreat from Business -- But have never made this Provision for futurity, that I might enjoy my Age with Ease, much less have I ever wished for a luxurious Solitude. I have never in any part of my public Life sought Profits or Honors. It was my Destiny to come into Life at a critical dangerous time, and to see Prospects before me that I dreaded and wished to avoid but could not, with Honor or a good Conscience. I took my Part according to the Dictates of my Heart and Head, and have gone  it and all its Horrors, and landed the Public safe and glorious in the Harbour of Peace. Thanks be to God! No Honors, not a Crown -- no Profits, not all the Indias, would be the smallest Temptation to me now to go thro' it again, nor would ever have tempted me to begin it. I thought it my Duty and that I should be a guilty Wretch if I did not do it. I have done it to the best of my Understanding, Health and Strength. I seek not Honors nor Profits now. But I have now a Right to be exempted from , Spots, Stains and Disgrace. Congress have stained and soiled me. They must wipe it out, or I throw off their Livery.   Yours with the same Sentiments as ever. "

","My dearest Friend L'Ambition dans l'oisivet la Bassesse dans l'orgueil, Le Desir de s'enrichir Sans travail, l'Aversion pour la v rit; la flatterie, la Trahison, la Perfidie, l'Abandon de tous Ses Engagemens, le m pris des devoirs du Citoyen, la Crainte de la Vertu du Prince, l'esp rance de Ses foiblesses, et plus que tout cela le ridicule perp tuel jett sur la vertu, forment, je crois, le caract re du plus grand Nombre des Courtisans, marqu dans tous les lieux et dans tous les tems. It is Montesquieu who draws this Picture. And I think it is drawn from the Life, and is an exact resemblance. You cannot wonder then that I am weary and wish to be at home upon almost any Terms. Your Life, would be dismal, in a high degree. You would be in an hideous Solitude, among Millions. None of them would be Society for you that you could endure. Mrs. Jay is in this Situation ardently longing to come home. Yet She is much better Circumstanced, than you are to be abroad, as her family is Smaller and younger. You must leave a Part of your Family. No Let Us live in our own Country, and in our own Way. Educate our Children to be good for something. Upon no Consideration  would I have any of my Children educated in  Europe. In Conscience I could not consent to it. If Congress had been Steady, and continued in force my Commission to make a Treaty of Commerce with  Great Britain, I should have gone to  London, and have finished the Treaty before now, but I should not have thought of residing in  London long. I should have resigned and returned to  America in a Year or two at furthest. If Congress should now revive my Commission and send me a new one, which I think altogether improbable, but believe they will  their Work, by Sending another Man upon that Errand, I would not Stay longer in  England than a Year or two at furthest. I cannot bare the Thought of a long Banishment from my own native Soil, where alone I can ever be happy, or comfortable. I write you by every opportunity, least you should embark for  Europe when I am upon my Passage home, which would be a terrible Disappointment to both. My Intention is to come home whether I receive the Acceptance of my Resignation or not, unless I receive a Commission to  St. James's. Dont you embark therefore  you receive a Letter from me desiring you to come. If I should receive Such a Commission I will write you immediately, by way of  France  Holland and  England, and shall wish you to come to me on the Wings of the Wind. But the Same Influence, french Influence I mean, which induced Congress to revoke my Commission, will still continue to prevent the Revival of it. And I think it likely too, that English Influence will now be added to French, for I dont believe that George wishes to see my face. In this Case I shall enjoy the satisfaction of coming where I wish most to be, with all my Children, living in Simplicity, Innocence, and Repose. What I write you, upon this subject is in Confidence and must not be communicated but with great discretion. "

","My dearest Friend I read in a great Writer, Montesquieu that  ""l'honneur, en imposant la loi de servir, veut en tre l'arbitre; et, s'il se trouve choqu, il exige ou permet qu'on se retire chez Soi."" C'est une des R gles supr mes de l'honneur, Que lorsque nous avons t une fois plac s dans un rang, nous ne devons rien faire ni souffrir qui fasse voir que nous nous tenons inferieurs  ce rang m me."" These being the  Laws of Honor in all the Countries of  Europe, it is astonishing that Congress should wound the feelings of their Servants whom they send to  Europe in such delicate Points, and by this means lessen their Reputations and Influence, at a time when they wanted Support to their Reputations more than any other Men. It may be said that Virtue, that is Morality, applied to the Public is the Rule of Conduct in , and not Honor. True. But American Ministers are acting in Monarchies, and not in Republicks. Such a Slur may not hurt a Man in  America so much as in  France, or  England or  Holland, but in these Countries it certainly diminishes him and his Utility exceedingly. But upon the Rule of Virtue, I hold that Virtue requires We should serve, where We can do most good. I am soberly of Opinion, that for one or two Years to come I could do more good in   England to the  United States of America, than in any other Spot upon Earth. Much of the immediate Prosperity of the  United States, and much of their future Repose, if not the Peace of the World, depends upon having just Notions now forthwith instilled in  London. But I think the British Court will be duped by the French and will entertain that dread of me, which neither ought to entertain, but which  France will inspire because She thinks I should be impartial -- so that I expect some bodyBooby will be sent, in Complaisance to two silly Courts, upon that most important of all Services. If Heaven has so decreed, I must submit, and the Submission will be most pleasant to me as an Individual and as a Man. I shall be in a Situation where I shall think that I could do more good in another. But I have been often in such a Situation. And things must take their Course. We must wait for Things to arrange themselves, when We cannot govern them. My Mind and Body stand in need of Repose. My Faculties have been too long upon the Stretch. A Relaxation of a few Years would be the Life the most charming to me, that I can concieve. Dont be concerned at  I have written concerning Spots, Blemishes, Stains and Disgraces. When all is known, they will be universally acknowledged to be Laurels, Ornaments and Trophies. They will do neither You nor me nor Ours harm in the End. I cannot say precisely, when You will see me. I hope by the Month of June or July, but it may be August or September, and it is possible it may be in April or May. It will depend upon the Time  when I shall recieve the Acceptance of my Resignation. Dont think of embarking for  Europe, not even if Congress should send me a Letter of Credence to King George, until You hear from me, because I think it is most probable I shall come home without Leave, if the Acceptance of my Resignation, or the Answers to my Letters should be delayed.

","My dearest Friend On the 30 Nov. our Peace was Signed. On the 28. March We dont know that you have Yet heard of it. A Packet Should have been Sent off. I have not yet received the Ratification of  my Dutch Treaty. I know not when I Shall be able to embark for home. If I receive the Acceptance of my Resignation, I Shall embark my in the first ship, the first good ship I mean, for I love you too well, to venture my self in a bad one, and I love my own Ease to well to go in a very Small one. I am Sometimes half afraid, that those Persons who procured the Revocation   of my Commission to , may be afraid I shall do them more harm in  America, than in  England, and therefore of two Evils to choose the least and manoeuvre to get my me sent to  London. By several Coaxing hints of that Kind, which have been written to me and given me in Conversation, from Persons who I know are employed to do it, I fancy that Something of that is in Contemplation. There is another Motive too -- they begin to dread the Appointment of some others whom they like less than me. I tremble when I think of such a Thing as going to  London. If I were to receive orders of that sort, it would be a dull day to me. No Swiss ever longed for home more than I do. I Shall forever be a dull Man in  Europe. I cannot bear the Thought of transporting my Family to  Europe. It would be the Ruin of my Children forever. And I cannot bear the Thought of living longer Seperate from them. Our foreign Affairs, are like to be in future as they have been in times past an eternal Scaene of Faction. The fluctuation of Councils at   Philadelphia have encouraged it, and even good Men Seem to be Seized with the Spirit of it. The definitive Treaty is yet delayed, and will be for  I can see till Mid Summer. It may however be signed in a few Weeks. If it should be signed I could go home with the Dutch Ambassador, in a Frigate which will sail from the  Texel in June. But So many Points are uncertain, that I cannot determine on any thing. Dont think of coming to  Europe however, unless you should receive a further desire from me, which is not at all probable. My present Expectations are to pay my Respects to you, at  Braintree, before Midsummer.  happiness employs my Thoughts night and Day. Dont let her form any Connections with any one, who is not devoted entirely to study and to Business. To honour and Virtue. If there is a Trait of Frivolity and Dissipation left, I pray that She may renounce it, forever. I ask not Fortune nor Favour for mine, but Prudence, Talents and Labour. She may go with my Consent whenever she can find enough of these. , has been another Source of Distress to me. The terrible Weather has made his journey from  Petersbourg very long. But I have a Letter from him at  Hamborough the 14th. and hope he is at the  Hague by this day. I am much relieved on his Account. My Charles and Thomas how are they? Fine Boys I dare Say? Let them take Care how they behave if they desire their Fathers Approbation. My Mother and your Father enjoy I hope a good Share of Health and Spirits. Mr. Cranch's Health is perfectly restored I hope, and Uncle Quincy and Dr. Tufts as good and as happy as ever. Why should not my Lot in Life be as easy as theirs? So it would have been if I had been as wise as they and staid at home as they do. But where would have been our Cod and Haddock, our Bever skins Deer skins and Pine Trees? Alass all lost, perhaps. Indeed I firmly believe so, in a good Conscience.  I cannot therefore repent of all my fatigues, Cares, Losses, Escapes, anxious Days and Sleepless nights. Nothing in Life ever cost me so much Sleep, or made me so many grey Hairs, as the Anxiety, I have Suffered for these Three Years on the Score of these Objects.  knows of it: Nobody cares for it. But I shall be rewarded for it, in Heaven I hope. Where Mayhew, and Thatcher  and Warren are rewarded I hope, none of whom however were permitted to suffer so much. They were taken away from the Evil to come. I have one  for you to ask of Mr. Adams the President of the senate. It is that he would make a compleat Collection of his Writings and publish them in Volumes. I know of no greater service that could be rendered to the Rights of Mankind. At least that he would give you a List of them. They comprize a Period of forty Years. And although they would not find so many Rakes for Purchasers, as the Writings of Voltaire, they would do infinitely more good to mankind especially in our rising Empire. There Posterity will find a Mass of Principles, and Reasonings, Suitable for them and for all good Men. The Copy, I fancy would Sell to Advantage in  Europe. "

","My dearest Friend It is now  five Years, Since I first arrived in  Europe, and in all that time I was never more impatient to hear from you and from  America in General, than I am now and have been for some months. Not a Word, Since the Beginning of January, except a Line from your Unckle, and Scarcely any Thing Since the 26 of Oct. when I arrived in  Paris. I have no intimation of the Arrival of my Dutch Treaties, four of which I put on board different Vessells at  Amsterdam in October. No News of Coffins Arrival who carried You, the richest Present I ever sent you from  Europe. No News of the Reception of the Peace. No Acceptance of my Resignation. And what is worse Still there is no Ministry in  England, and consequently We cannot finish the definitive Treaty, and consequently I cant come home without Leave. This Life of a Spider is very unpleasant. I have been all Winter upon Tenter Hooks. Indeed I fear, We shall have no Arrivals before June or the latter End of May. If so my Fidgets must continue two months longer. If  Should, be disgusted with  Europe as much as I am she would repent of her Rashness in ever thinking of coming here.  I hope a Commission will arrive with the first ships, to make a Treaty of Commerce with  G. Britain. We have lost an admirable Opportunity of making the best Treaty for the Publick, by the Revocation of mine without sending another. Some Persons Suppose, that such a Commission will arrive to me, others to Mr. Laurens others to Dr. Franklin, others to Mr. Jay, others that Mr. A. Lee will come others that Mr. Izard will be the Man, and some that Mr. Jefferson. Of all these Persons I think myself the least likely. But still it is possible and it is certain that Congress will commit a Mistake, by appointing any others But the same Influence which led them into the first Error, may continue them in it. Supposing a Commission should come to me, I am frightened at the Thought of it. How will the King and the Courtiers the City and the Country look at me? What Prospect can I have of a tollerable Life there? I shall be Slandered and plagued there, more than in France. It is a Sad Thing that Simple Integrity should have so many Ennemies in this World, without deserving one. In the Case Supposed I must go to  London and reconnoiter -- see how the Land lies and the faces look, before you think of coming to me. I will not stay there, to be plagued. One may soon judge. If I should find a decent Reception and a Prospect of living comfortably a Year or two there I will write for you. All this is you see upon a supposition which is improbable. It would be infinitely more agreable to my own heart to come home and quit  Europe forever. At home I can take Care of my Children, to give them Education and put them into Business. If I should remain abrod my Children must suffer for it and be neglected.

 But in all Events I will not stay in  Holland, the Air of which is totally inconsistent with my Health. I have tried it, very sufficiently. I can never be well nor enjoy myself there. In other respects I like that Country very well.  has been taken much notice of, in his journey from  Petersbourg by Ambassadors and other People of Rank who write much in his favour, both for Prudence and Knowledge. This will go by Mrs. Izard, who is about embarking from  Bourdeaux for  Philadelphia with her Family "
"Paris  April 8. 1783
","My dearest Friend What would I not give for an Arrival from  America? or for certain Advice from  London of the Appointment of a Ministry, or for the Arrival here of a Minister to Sign the definitive Treaty? What would I not give for an Arrival from  America or for Advice from  London what the Ministry intend to do? Mr. Hartley is now here but We advance slowly to the definitive Treaty. I can now have no hopes of Seeing you before late in the Fall. If the Acceptance of my Resignation arrives, as I expect, and We finish the Peace, as soon as I can reasonably hope, I shall not now be able to embark before October. The Affairs of the World have little Complaisance for my Happiness, or yours, but it is not worth our while to be impatient, because it will do us no good. I am astonished however that We have nothing from Congress nor from you. If you and  were with me, I could keep up my Spirits, but idly and insipidly as I pass my time, I am weary, worn and disgusted to death. I had rather chop Wood, dig Ditches, and make fence upon my poor little farm.  Alass! poor Farm and poorer Family what have you lost, that your Country might be free and that others might catch fish and hunt Deers and Bevers at their Ease? There will be as few of the  ""Tears of Gratitude"" or  ""the Smiles of Admiration,"" or the  ""Sighs of Pity"" for Us, as for the Army. But all this should not hinder me from going over the same  again upon the Same Occasion, Scaenes which I would not encounter for all the Wealth Pomp and Powers of the World. Boys! if you ever Say one Word, or utter one Complaint, I will disinherit you. Work you Rogues and be free. You will never have so hard Work to do as Papa has had. Daughter! Get you an honest Man for a Husband, and keep him honest. No matter whether he is rich, provided he be independent. Regard the  and moral Character of the Man more than all other Circumstances. Think of no other Greatness but that of the soul, no other Riches but those of the Heart. An honest, Sensible humane Man, above all the Littlenesses of Vanity, and Extravagances of Imagination, labouring to do good rather than be rich, to be usefull rather than make a show, living in a modest Simplicity clearly within his Means and free from Debts or Obligations, is really the most respectable Man in Society, makes himself and all about him the most happy. I long to see my dear , as much as the Rest, but he is well at the  Hague and I cannot go to him nor do I think it prudent to bring him to  Paris. I have accomplished a Correspondence between the Royal society of Medicine here, and the Republican one at Boston at the Desire of  but have not yet found a carefull Hand to send the Diploma. "
"Paris  April 11. 1783
","My dearest Friend There is at length a Ministry in England composed of Kings Friends and Peoples Men, which will effervesce, and throw out a great deal of fixed Air like Potash and Lime Juice.  and Mr. Hartley are to be here in a few days to enter upon the definitive Treaty, but it is now probable there will be a Congress under the Mediation of the two imperial Courts at least respecting the Terms between  England and  Holland. Whether it will be expected that We should join in the Congress or not, I dont know. In any Case I am afraid it will be So long before our Affair is finished that I shall loose the Opportunity of a Spring or Summer Passage home, and a fall Passage is not so Short nor so agreable. I have  in my own mind, a long time, whether I Should take a Short Excursion to  London before my Return. I Should be glad, once, to see that fine Country, but I believe I shall deny myself that Pleasure; Circumstances have placed me in an awkward Situation with regard to  England, and I think upon the whole it will be most prudent to avoid it.   England is in danger of being a Scaene of Confusion, and whoever shall be Sent there by Congress will no have a very pleasant Residence if he does his Duty. Yet it is in the Eyes of many, the Apple of Paradise. I See Such Symptoms of an ardent desire of it, in Several Persons, as make me Smile very often. I wish the Commission which was once given to me and So unaccountably taken away again, had never existed. In that Case I Should never have interfered with the Appetite of any one. And I wish I was now at home, out of the Scramble. I Should not feel very reverential under Such an igdi indignity, Such a Mark of Contempt as the Appointment of another to that Court, while I am in  Europe. If I ever merited the Appointment, I have done nothing Since to forfeit it, but on the Contrary have rendered to the Publick Since that time, Such Services as were never rendered by any other Minister in Europe. The most critical, important and decisive Services, as it is in my Power at any time to prove, if Congress have not already Sufficient Proofs of it. The French Ministers, who procured the Revocation of my Commission, are is now I believe Sorry enough for it. They now see a danger of its falling into hands which they dislike and distrust more than mine, into the Hands of Gentlemen who have passed a great Part of their Lives in  England, have numerous Family Connections there as well as other Friendships and Acquaintances. I have fretted and laughed, very sufficiently at the  ""petite Ruse,"" which deprived me of the Feather, but I know it to be a Feather and I will still laugh at it, what ever becomes of it.

 It Seems as if, We were never to hear from  America more. Not one Word, any more than if  the Antlantic Islands were Sunk again Sunk, as they are fabled to have once sunk and rose again.  Felicity is near very near my Heart. I must resign her to your Prudence and the Advice of your Friends. If Coffin is arrived he carried a Present for her. I wish I could do more for her, but I cannot, at present. I am again obliged to have recourse to a Saddle horse.  and I trot about the Environs of  Paris, and Speculate about a distant Country where our hearts are. I have been in the former Part of Life so accustomed to riding, that it is become necessary to me. I attribute my Fever, in Part to a too long neglect of this Exercise. Whether I shall ever get rid of the Effects of that Fever I dont know. A Voyage home, a little Repose and rural Exercises may cure me, but I fear a European Life will never do it. My Boys I hope are good. They know not how tenderly they are beloved by their Father. "
"Paris  April 16. 1783
","My dearest Friend It Seems as if Providence had ordered many Things for the last Months, in Such a manner as to put my Patience and Resignation to the . I dont know whether Jobs Tryals were more Severe. 1. Mr. John who was to have been at the  Hague by Christmas has been detained at  Stockholm,  Copenhagen and  Hamborough at which last Place he was on the 4. of this month, you may imagine my Anxiety about him. 2. Your Letters concerning Miss N. have given me as much Concern as they ought -- not knowing the Character? nor what to advise, but feeling all a Fathers Tenderness, longing to be at home that I might enquire and consider and take the Care I ought. 3. The Uncertain State of Things in  England, leaving me idle, with nothing to do but Think of my Situation. 4. The Want of Intelligence from  America, in Answer to the most important Dispatches both to the public and to me which ever crossed the seas, not one Word yet. 5. Standing here in Relation with two Personages at least in whom I can have no Confidence. Mr. Jay has been my only Consolation. In him I have found a Friend to his Country, without Alloy. I shall never forget him, nor cease to love him, while I live. He has been happier than I, having his Family with him, no Anxiety for his Children, and his Lady with him, to keep Up his Spirits. His Happiness in this particular, has made me more unhappy for what I know under the Seperation from mine. In answer to  , I assure you that all the Money I advanced to the Prisoners in  England was out of my own Pocket. I had at that time no Public Money in my Power. So that it may be paid to you if it is ever paid at all. I am afraid that all the Money you have laid out in  Vermont Lands is lost. You can ill afford it, I assure you. You are destined to be poor in your old Age, and therefore the more perfectly you reconcile  to the Thought of it the better. Your Children have no Resource but in their own Labour. They will have this Advantage, they may labour a little for themselves, more than their Father could ever do, without betraying Trusts which it was his duty to Accept. "
"Paris  April 16. 1783
","My dearest Friend If Congress when they revoked my Commission had appointed another to make a Treaty of Commerce with  Great Britain, We should have had the Business all done on the 30 of Nov. Shelburnes Ministry would not have been condemned in the H. of Commons, and the definitive Treaty would have been signed before now and I Should be ready to embark for the  Blue Hills, where I must go to recover my health, repose my Spirits, take a little Care of my Sons and Daughter, and be made much of, by their Mother. My last Voyage and Residence in  Europe has broken me very much. Millions of Contrivances are used, by some invisible Spirit, with Arrows shot in darkness to render an honest Mans Life uncomfortable to him, in every Part of  Europe. In  England the only Place where I could go with , I should live the Life of a Man in a Barrell Spiked with Nails. The Vanity, Pride, Revenge, of that People, irritated by French and Franklinian Politicks, would make it Purgatory to me. I sometimes feel Seriously afraid that Congress will send me, a Credence to that Court. I should be terrified at the sight of such a Thing. My Health, to Speak to you Seriously, demands a Voyage home, my native Air and Repose from Business. You know very well that those Remedies alone have heretofore saved my Life. The Consequences of that  Amsterdam Fever, are still upon me in Swelled Ankles, Weakness in my Limbs, a Sharp  in my Blood, lowness of Spirits, Anxieties &c. I exercise every day on horse back or on foot, and take every Precaution in my Power, but all does not avail. I begin to suspect that french and franklinian  will now endeavour to get me sent to  England, for two Reasons, one that I may not go to  America where I should do them more Mischief as they think than I could in  London. 2. That the Mortifications which they and their Tools might give me there might disembarrass them of me sooner than any where. Is it not Strange and Sad that Simple Integrity should have so many ? that a Man should have to undergo so many Evils merely because he will not betray his Trust? If I would have given up the Fisheries and  Illinois and  Louisiana and  Ohio, I might have had Gold snuff Boxes, Clappings at the Opera, I dont mean from the Girls, millions of Paragraphs in the Newspapers in praise of me, Visits from the Great, Dinners Wealth, Power Splendor, Pictures Busts statues, and every Thing which a vain heart, and mine is much too vain, could desire. Mais je ne Scais pas, me donner aux tells Convenances et Bienseances. I have found by Experience, that in this Age of the World that Man has an  Lot, who  ""dares to love his Country and be poor."" Liberty and Virtue! When! oh When will your  cease to exist and or to persecute! Our Country will be envied, our Liberty will be envied, our Virtues will be envied. Deep and subtle systems of Corruption hard to prove, impossible to detect, will be practised to sap and undermine Us and the few who penetrate them will be called suspicious, envious, restless turbulent ambitious -- will be hated unpopular and unhappy But a Succession of these Men must be preserved, for these are the salt of the Earth. Without these the World would be worse than it is. Is not this after all the noblest Ambition. Such Ambition is Virtue. Cato will never be  but Catos Ambition was sublimer than Caesars, and his Glory and even his Catastrophy more desirable. I have Sometimes painted to myself my own Course for these 20 Years, by a Man running a race upon a right line barefooted   treading among burning Ploughshares, with the horrid Figures of Jealousy Envy, Hatred Revenge, Vanity Ambition, Avarice Treachery Tyranny Insolence, arranged on each side of his Path and lashing him with scorpions all the Way, and attempting at every Step to trip up his Heels. I have got through, however to the Goal, but maimed scarrified and out of Breath. "
"Paris  May 18. 1783
","My dearest Friend You may well Suppose that I am not very easy when you are informed that We have no News from  America, and that the definitive Treaty is neither Signed, or likely to be Signed very Soon. Mr. Hartley it is true is here and is well disposed to finish, with Liberality and with dispatch: but he must wait for orders at every Step, and his principals are either not firm in their Places or not decided in their System: So that it is impossible to foresee, when the End will be. I hope the first Ships will bring me, my Quietus. If my Resignation is accepted, I do not yet despair of embarking in the Month of June. If it is not, I must wait for a Fall Passage, which will be much less . I am at Sea and must wait the Motions of Winds and currents. What I most dread is, that my Resignation will not be accepted, in which Case I shall be necessitated either to go  home without Leave, or Stay in  Europe in a ridiculous state of Torture. This last I will not long submit too. I have already contracted in  Holland, Disorders which will perhaps never leave me, and the poisonous Steams of that Country, are utterly inconsistent with my Health, besides it is a Place where I can do no good; for which Reasons I am unalterably determined not to remain there. To send another to  England and oblige me to remain in  Holland would be a Piece of Tyranny; and a Slight and an affront to me which I will not bear at all Events. To take the Conduct of a  affair from a Man who has, made Voyages and journeys run Risques and made Sacrifices, in the discharge of his Duty and brought it almost to a Conclusion, is regarded by every Man, who knows any Thing of human Feelings, as a most invidious Injustice. And whoever is the sordid Crawler to swallow it, I am not.  is at the  Hague in good health, and pursuing his Studies. I hope, our other Children are well. I hear Coffin is arrived and I hope what he had for you and my other Nabby were satisfactory. "
"Paris  May 20. 1783
","My dearest Friend No News yet from  America! We Yesterday, exchanged Full Powers with Mr. Hartley, and have agreed to meet at my House, every Evening at Six o Clock,  We Shall have finished. This looks as if We were under Weigh, and I hope We shall reach Port. But cannot guess, how Soon. My Residence in  Holland has given me many  Remembrancers, and among the Rest the Scurvy I walk every day, never less than a League and some days two or three. I am as carefull of my Diet, Rest &c. as possible: but all is not enough. I shall never get rid of the Rests of that Fever and the damp Chills and Sour putrid Steams of the Low Countries. Their Records are full of me, and my Veins are full of their Stagnant Water, they send me Medals too to perpetuate the Remembrance. Three different Medals have been sent me Since I have been in  Paris, one in Commemoration of the Resolution of the States of  Friesland, in  1782 to receive me, another of that of the states General of 19th.  of April 1782, and a third of the signature of the Treaty 8 Oct. 1782. I hope a Voyage home, and a little Repose may restore me to health or at least give me some Relief. I wonder of what Materials, Congress think I am made? When they found it necessary to recall that honest Steady, persevereing virtuous Patriot and Citizen Mr. Silas Deane, they were anxious to Save his Reputation, and covered up his Faults by a pretence that they wanted to consult with him about their foreign Affairs. When, at the Instigation of French Finesse, they took from me Authorities, in the Execution of which I had gone so far, and which french Finesse wanted taken from me for no other Reason but because it knew I should execute it too faithfully, they never thought of assigning any Reason at all.  Stat pro ratione Voluntas. And Posterity are left to accuse or suspect me if they can. Thank God they can accuse, nor suspect me of , but an Integrity of full Proof in all Tryals. But Posterity can think very meanly of those Members of Congress, who voted for those Sordid Resolutions. "
"Paris  May 30. 1783
","My dearest Friend Here I am, out of all Patience. Not a Word from  America. The British Ministry, lingering on. Mr. Hartley uncertain what to do. No Regulation of Commerce agreed on. No definitive Treaty of Peace, Signed, nor likely to be Signed very Soon. My Spring Passage home lost. To embark in July or August, would be the worst Season of the whole Year -- on Account of Heat and Calms. I dont See a Possibility of embarking before September or October. The total Idleness, the perpetual Uncertainty We are in, is the most insipid and at the Same Time disgusting and provoking Situation imaginable. I had rather be employed in carting Street Dust and Marsh Mud. Neither do I know how or where, I shall get a Passage. I could now go with Mr. Van Berckel in a fine new 68 Gun ship. In the Fall, I suppose I shall be obliged to step on board a Merchant ship loaded down to the Brim.  But whether from  Holland, or from Some Port in  France I know not. So many Vessells will run away to  England, that I fear it will be difficult to find a Passage from France or  Holland. But We must bear it all, if We can.  is at the  Hague pursuing his Studies with great Ardour. They give him a good Character wherever he has been, and I hope he will make a good Man. It is unaccountable that not one  should have arrived from any Part of  New England, Since the Peace nor for so long a Time before. But all is Mystery. Pray write me. Dont omit to write, untill I arrive home, direct to the Care of Mr. Dumas a L'hotel des  Etats Unis D'Amerique, at the  Hague, or to the Care of Mr. Jay, at  Paris. These Gentlemen will take Care of your Letters, if I should be gone.  "
"Paris  June 10. 1783.
","My dearest Friend Day after day, Week after Week, Month after Month, roll away and bring Us no News. I am So weary of this idle useless Time, that I dont know what to do with myself. I dont wonder that People who have So much more of Such Time, than has fallen to my Share, have recourse to Play for dissipation. I find myself in the Same Situation with my Lord Chesterfield who Says in one of his Letters, that he had a dangerous Fever in  Holland, that after his Recovery the febrific  fell into his Legs which Swelled to Such a degree as to be very troublesome to himself and all who came near him. That upon his Return to  England he consulted Mead, Broxholme and Arbuthnot who were ignorant of his Disorder and did him no good but on the contrary increased the Swelling by improper Applications of Poultices &c. That he then consulted a surgeon who told him his Evil proceeded from a Relaxation of the skin and that he must bath his Legs, every Morning in Brine from the Salters in which Meat had been pickled, as warm as he could bear it. He followed this Advice and in three Weeks all his Symptoms disappeared and never returned. My Swelling has never been So violent, but it is not yet cured. If I increase my Exercise, beyond the usual degree, it returns in  degree.  I know not where to find the Brine, and have never done any Thing for it but Walk every day. But this Weakness in the Ankles is not all. I am vexed with other Relicks of that fever, which are very troublesome. They appear in sharp fiery humours which break out in the back Part of my Neck and in other Parts of me and plague me, as much as the Uncertainty in which I am in of my future destination. Let me get home and I will take Care how I run away again. It is now 3 Months Since Barney arrived in  Philadelphia and We have no answers to any of our Letters. What is the Meaning of it? "
"Paris  June 19. 1783
","My dearest Friend The Legion of Lauzun has arrived, and We hope has brought the Orders of Congress, for Us, but We have not yet received them, and as much at a Loss as ever. I know not whether my Resignation is accepted, and consequently can give you no Conjecture, when I all be able to get away. As the Spring and Summer Passage is lost, I cannot now embark before September or October, or November. ether I Shall embark from  France,  Holland  or  England I dont know. It will be according as I shall hear of a convenient Passage. Write me by all these Ways. I have received no Line from you,  Since December. The definitive Treaty may be Signed in three Weeks: and it may as probably be trained on till Christmas. In the last Case, provided the Acceptance of my Resignation Should not arrive, it may be Spring before I can embark. In this State of Suspense and Perplexity you may well Suppose I do not Sleep upon a bed of Roses, especially, as the Public Affairs are as uncertain as our private ones. I Should like very well, to take a Short Tour to  London before my turn, for the Sake of taking a look at that Country, and Seeing me Personages there, because if I waive this Opportunity, it is not likely I Shall ever have another. Once more at home, it is not probable, I Shall again go abroad. Indeed it is more for the Sake of Mr. John than my own, that I wish to see  England, at all. I was at  Versailles, the day before Yesterday and paid my Respects the  and Queen, Monsieur and Madame his Lady, the Comte D'Artois, Madame Elizabeth and the Mesdames of France Adelaide and Victoire. As the Weather was more like a Spring Equinox than Summer Solstice, the Number of Ambassadors was Smaller than usual, and the Attendant Croud less, So that I had a better Opportunity, of viewing the Royal Family at Leisure, then ever I had before. I dined and breakfasted in deed, with the Ambassadors and found them universally more Sociable, than ever they were before. They begin now universally to consider and treat Us, as Members of their Body. It is forbidden I Suppose to Princes and Princesses upon these Occasions, to utter a Sentiment least they Should betray a Secret of State or Say something which might lead a Sagacious Ambassador to political Consequences. According No one Word is ever Said, except asking a Question about some common Thing, as the Weather  the Spectacles, or have you come from  Paris to day. I know an Ambassador who has been fourteen Years at a Court, who has attended regularly once a Week, who says that a Prince has never failed to ask him the Same question, every Time.  ""Did you come from home ."" -- and never any other. This Ambassador too, is of the highest Rank. Among all the Officers, who come in Play upon these Occasions Such as Introducers of Ambassadors, Secretary of the Presentations of Ambassadors &c., there ought I think to be one, Praeceptor to teach the Princes and Princesses, the Art of asking Questions and making Observations upon these Occasions. The Prince of Orange's Court is a Miniature of that of  Versailles. The Ceremonials, and the Conversation of Princes and Princesses is much the Same. The English Gentlemen here particularly Mr. Hartley tells me, I must be presented at Court, if I should go to  London only for a Visit, in my  Character as a Minister at the Peace. This is rather a discouraging Circumstance, as I should wish to go incog. as much as possible, and my Appearance at Court would make more Talk than I wish. I should be Stared at, as a Sight. I Should be treated however complaisantly enough, I doubt not. The Case is altered. I had rather make my Court to my Princesses at  [illegible]    Pens Hill, than to all the others in the World. This Honour I hope for but cannot promise myself so soon, as I wish. "

I begin to fear it will not be, till next year. Yet I am in constant hopes every Moment of receiving from Congress my Quietus. If it comes I shall embark in September, October or November. But whether from  France,  Holland or  England I know not. The Uncertainty in which We are left is cruel. We have no Information of the sentiments of Congress upon the Peace,   nor any Intimation of their Pleasure for the future. My  and my brave Boys, what would I give to see them and how much more their Mamma. John is translating Suetonius and Virgil into French at the  Hague. He says very gravely it is more convenient to him to turn them into French than English. This is not pleasing to me, who still love the English Language better than the French. We dont yet know whether you are angry with Us for making Peace, or what you think of Us. "
"Paris  July 9. 1783
","My dearest Friend Not a Line from you since December. Congress has not  off our heads for making Peace, and that is some Comfort. I am not in health and dont expect to be, untill I can get home. But when will this be? We are all at as great Uncertainty as We have been these six Months. Yet one should think it cannot be long before the Treaty is finished. You must not cease to write to me, untill I arrive at your Door. Write by  England  Holland  France. The Letters will find their Way. Write decently and then I dont care if they open your Letters, at present. My Duty to my Mother and Father, Brothers and sisters,  and Aunts, Sons and Daughter, Cousins and all the rest. I am very angry with my  in  Mass. They neglect me most Shamefully. I wrote them a Multitude of Letters from the  Hague last summer and again from  Paris last Winter, and have no answer from any one, but a friendly Letter from Mr. Dalton of  Newbury Port. I Suppose they are afraid to write me. Fine indeed. I should have excepted a Letter or two from Gen. Warren. I cant learn whether he is in Congress or not. He will receive some long Letters from me. Pray him to be very cautious of them. Neither they nor I can do any good in the present Circumstances. Dr. Franklin gives out very seriously that he must return and he has been lately more than commonly Smooth and gracious. I know not what his Intentions are. Receiving no Answers to  or private Letters that We know have been received is very painfull. And the long Uncertainty about every thing is enough to kill one. All but me are pretty well. "

Congress have given Leave to Mr. Laurens and Mr. Dana to go home. My Conge is not yet arrived. Mr. Dana however will not get home this Year as he will have a Treaty to make.

When I get my Son with me, I shall be ready to go to any Place, where I may embark for home, as soon as I get Leave. I am weary beyond all Expression of waiting in this State of Uncertainty about . It is at this Moment as uncertain as it was six months ago when the definitive Treaty will be signed. Mr. Laurens and Mr. Dana have leave to go home. Mr. Danas is upon a Condition, however, which is not yet fullfilled so that he will not go home for some time.  Dr. Franklin Says he is determined to go home, and Mr. Jay talks of going next Spring. In Short it is a terrible Life We lead. It wearies out the Patience of job, and affects the health of Us all.  writes met that Charles and Thomas are gone or were going to  Haverhill, under the Care of Mr. Shaw. I approve of this very much. They will learn no Evil there. With them at  Haveril, yourself and Miss Nabby and Mr. John with me, I could bear to live in  Europe another Year or two. But I cannot live much longer without my Wife and Daughter and I will not. I want two Nurses at least: and I wont have any, at least female ones but my Wife and Daughter. I tremble too, least a Voyage and change of Climate should alter your health. I dare not wish you in  Holland for there my Charles, , My servants and myself were forever Sick. I am half a Mind to come home with the definitive Treaty, and then if Congress dismiss me, well -- . If they send me back again I can  take you and your Daughter with me. However I can determine upon nothing. I am now afraid We shall not meet till next Spring. I hear, by Word of Mouth that Congress will not determine upon my Resignation till they have received the definitive Treaty. Heaven know when this will be. It will be a Mercy to Us all, if they let me come home: for if you and your Daughter come to  Europe you will get into your female imaginations, fantastical Ideas that will never wear out, and will Spoil you both. [A mark following this inserted sentence indicates that the three final paragraphs, beginning ""The Question is whether . . ."", should be inserted at this point.]  I hope  New York and  Penobscot will be evacuated before this reaches you. That will be some Comfort. You must pray Mr. Storer or your  to send Your Letters to me, by Way of  New York  Philadelphia,  London  Bilbao,  Holland  France or any way. If they inclose them to any of their Friends in  London they will get to me. Farewell, my dearest Friend Farewell. The Question is whether it is possible for a Lady, to be once accustomed to the Dress,  &c. of  Europe, without having her head turned by it? This is an awfull Problem. If you cannot be Mistress enough of yourself, and be answerable for your Daughter, that you can put on and put off these Fooleries like real Philosophers, I advise you never to come to your  Europe, but order Your husband home, for this you may depend on, your Residence in  Europe will be as uncertain as the Wind. It cannot be depended on for one Year no nor for Six Months. You have Seen two or three very Striking Instances of the Precariousness, of Congress Commissions, in my first, second and third.  The Bread that is earned on a Farm is simple but sure. That which depends upon Politicks is as uncertain as they. You know your Man. He will never be a Slave. He will never cringe. He will never accommodate his Principles, sentiments or Systems, to keep a Place, or to get a Place, no nor to please  his Daughter, or his Wife. He will never depart from his Honour, his Duty, no nor his honest Pride for Coaches, Tables, Gold, Power or Glory. Take the Consequences then. Take a Voyage to  Europe if the Case should so happen that I shall write to you to come live three Months. Let your Man See something in a different Light from his Masters, and give them offence, be recalled. You and he return back to the  Blue Hills, to live upon a Farm. Very good. Let Lyars and slanderers without any of this, write Reports and nourish Factions behind his back, and the same effect is produced. I repeat it. It will be a Blessing to Us all, if I am permitted to return. Be cautious my Friend, how you Speak upon these subjects. I know that Congress are bound, from regard to their own  as well as mine, to send me to  England, but it is the most difficult Mission in the Universe, and the most desperate, there is no Reputation to be got by it, but a great deal to be lost. It is the most expensive and extravagant Place in  Europe, and all that would be allowed would not enable one to live, as a set of insolent Spendthrifts would demand. I am quite content to come home and go to Farming, be a select Man, and owe no Man any Thing but good Will. There I can get a little health and teach my Boys to be Lawyers. "
"Amsterdam  July 26. 1783. Saturday.
","My dearest Friend Last Saturday, I left  Paris, and on Tuesday arrived, at  the Hague.  I am come to this Town. I Shall return to  Paris in a Fortnight. So as to make my whole Absence about three Weeks. Soon after my Return I expect the definitive Treaty will be Signed, but in this I may be mistaken. My Son is with me in good health. I had a tender Meeting with the dear Companion of my Wages and journeys, and have been very happy with him, ever Since. He is grown a Man in Understanding as well as Stature. He gives a very intelligent and entertaining Account of his Travels to and from the North. I shall take him with me to  Paris, and Shall make much of his Company. I have no Letters from you this Year, and not knowing what to do with myself, I am in much Perplexity. I hope Soon to be informed of the orders of Congress. If they accept my Resignation, I may come home in October. If not, I know not what will become of me. To Stay another winter hung up between one Thing and another in   would be the most disagreable Thing that could happen to me. Patience however. If my Health was as good as it was two Years ago, before my great Sickness I could be patient. But continual ill health added to all the Perplexities that distract me, is too much for me. I want two Nurses, my Wife and my Daughter, and three gay Boys about Us to keep Us all in good humour. But this is too much. My Boys must have their Educations. I am told a  is just arrived from  Boston and another, Cazneau expected. I hope for Letters by both. A Letter from  and a few Lines from Mr. Smith and Mr. Storer are all I have had from  N. England an immense long Time. What have I done to be thus punished? I am come here to See if  can be done to get Money, to prevent Mr. Morris's Bills from being protested. I hope that Some thing may be done but am not very Sanguine. I wonder whether  but you would believe me Sincere if I were to Say how much I love you, and wish to be with you and never to be Seperated more? "
"Paris  August 14. 1783
","My dearest Friend I have received your two  of  7 May  and  20 June . I had received no Letter from you for so long an Interval that these were really inestimable. I always learn more of Politicks from your Letters, than any others. I have lost all my Correspondents in Congress. I wrote to Mr. Jackson and Gen. Warren Supposing they were Members. Mr. Gerry is there now, to my Great Joy. Beg of him to write to me, if I stay in  Europe. I learn with great Satisfaction the Wisdom of my Daughter, whom I long to see. What is to be my Fate I know not. We have not received any joint Commission to make a Treaty of Commerce with  Great Britain. I hate to force  home without Leave, and Congress have not given me Leave as Mr. Lee gave you Reason to expect. My Son is with me, at present, and you will be as proud of him as I shall be of my Daughter, when I see her. He is grown up a Man, and his Steadiness and Sobriety, with all his Spirits are much to his honour. I will make of him my Secretary while I Stay. I like the Situation of  and Tom. Your Purchase of Land  gives me more Pleasure than you are aware. I wish you had described it. I Suppose it to be that fine Grove which I have loved and admired from my Cradle. If it is, I would not part with it, for Gold. If you know of any Woodland or salt Marsh to be sold, purchase them and draw upon me for the Money. Your Bills shall be paid upon Sight. Direct the Bills to be presented if I should be returned home, to Messrs. Wilhem and Jan Willink Merchants  Amsterdam, who will accept and pay them for the Honour of the Drawer. Pray dont let a Single Tree be cutt upon that Spot. I expect, very soon, to be a private Man, and to have no other Resource for my Family but my Farm, and therefore it is my Intention when I come home to sell my House in  Boston and to collect together all the Debts due to me and all other little Things that I can convert into Money and lay it out in Lands in the Neighbourhood of our Chaumiere. The whole will not will make a large but a Small Farm, Yet it will be large enough for my Desires if my Children are content. You Speak of a high Offices In Gods Name, banish every Idea of such a Thing. It is the Place of the Greatest slavery and Drudgery in the World. It would only introduce me to endless Squabbles and Disputes, and expose me to eternal obloquy and Envy. I wish that all Parties would unite in the present one  who has the Hearts of that People and will keep them. The Opposition will only weaken and distress his Administration, and if another were chosen in his Place, the Administration of that other would be weakened and distressed by a Similar Opposition. I have not health to go through the Business, nor have I Patience to endure the Smart. I beg that neither You nor yours would ever encourage in yourselves or others such a Thought. If I return home If after my Return home, the state should think proper to send me to Congress and you will go with me, I will go, for a short time, but not a long one. After that if I should be chosen into the senate or House, I should be willing to contribute my Mite, to the publick service in that Way. At home, upon my Farm and among my Books assisting in the Education of my Children, and endeavouring to introduce them into Business to get their Bread and do some service in the World, I wish to pass the feeble Remnant of my Days. But I am too much hurt, by those Exertions to which the Times have called me, to wish or to be capable of any great active Employment whatsoever. You know not how much your Friend is altered. The Fever burnt up half his Memory and more than half his Spirits, and has left him, with scorbutic Disorders about him that are very troublesome.  [illegible]   Without Repose, if with it, he can never hope to get the better of them. This is said to you my friend in Confidence and is to be communicated to no one else. Adieu After having seen so many of my friends, thro Life fall Victims to the great Contest, I think my self very happy to have got through it, in no worse a Condition. "
"Paris  Sept. 1 1783
","My dearest Friend I have not received my Letters of Recall from  Holland and therefore must disappoint you and . I have requested them anew and Suppose I shall receive them about Christmas, but whether I do or not, I shall come home, at latest in the first Spring ships, unless I should receive Some new Commission in  Europe, which is not likely. I am unalterably determined not to stay in  Holland where I never have any tollerable Health. To break away and come home without Leave, would neither be civil to Congress nor to the states General nor to the statholder, I hope I shall not be obliged to do it, but if I cannot obtain Leave, I must take it. I propose a Tour of three Weeks to  England and shall take my son with me, whose Company is the greatest Pleasure of my Life. His Behaviour and close Attention to his studies are very pleasing to me, and promise to produce, a worthy Character. I have  Several, very agreable Letters from my Daughter, which I shall answer if I can, as well as yours, which always afford me more Intelligence, than I get from any other American source. You may continue to write me under Cover. I am much pleased with your Purchase, and with the Boys Shool and Preceptor.  is embarked as I suppose from  Petersbourg, and will be soon in  Boston, defeated in his Endeavours to serve his Country, by jesuitical Schemes from  Passy and other sources, from whence have Sprung so many obstacles to the publick Good. Never was a Country, more imposed on by Finesse. Our late Minister of foreign affairs appears to have been a mere Puppet danced upon French Wires electrified from  Passy. I hope there will be, an End of this Philosophical and political Conjuration, if not, I am determined to get out of its striking Distance. Hitherto, altho it has tossed and tormented me, and prevented me from doing a great Part of the Good I meditated, and am Sure should have accomplished without it: yet it has not totally defeated me. Yet it has defeated me in so many Things and others in so many more, that it is high time to break it up. I thank the  and Mr. Cranch for their very friendly Letters, but their Speculations into futurity, are not well grounded. Give Us Peace in our Day, for there is none that lightest for Us but thou O God, is a Prayer of the Church of England which no son of the Church has a better right to offer up than I -- and none can make it more sincerely. Adieu, My dearest Friend Adieu, oh when Shall We meet? Next Spring most certainly God Willing. "
"Paris  Septr. 4. 1783
","My dearest Friend I have the Satisfaction to inform you that the definitive Treaties were all Signed yesterday, and the Preliminaries with  Holland were Signed the day before. Ours is a Simple Repetition of the provisional Treaty. So We have negotiated here, these Six Months for nothing. We could do no better Situated as We were.  We dined with Mr. Hartley and drank Tea with the Duchess of Manchester. Thus you see We are very good Friends, quite free, easy and Social. Now I dont Know what to do with . I wish I knew more of the Intentions of Congress. The Leave to come home which Mr. Lee promised you is not arrived, and I cannot go with Decorum without Leave and the Loan, an important matter would Suffer. I believe upon the whole I Shall wait, untill We hear from Congress of their Reception of the definitive Treaty, when no doubt they will Send me their Orders. I Shall have a gloomy Winter at  the Hague, but a Tour to  London of two or three Weeks and the Company of my Friend your Son, will relieve me a good deal. This Boy is a cordial to me. I Suppose that our foreign affairs will be wholly new modelled, on the Receipt of the definitive Treaty. Some Say We shall all be recalled, and Consuls only appointed. Others Think that Ministers will be continued, or new ones Sent to  Versailles,  London,  the Hague and  Madrid. Others that Ministers will be sent to the two Empires. But all is uncertain. I Shall make you a Small Remittance by . I Shall make Mr. John, my Secretary. He has acted in that Capacity, some Weeks and done very well. I Shall not be able to find Time to write to many of my Friends by this opportunity although it is so good a one.  will be home before me. I envy him. But he will do great good. He is a thoroughly Sensible Man, and entirely well principled. No Man knows our foreign affairs, and difficulties better than he. I have no Patience at the insidious Manoeuvres by which he has been defeated.  has fallen down again with the Gout and Gravel. He is better, and has been to  Versailles and  Paris, but he breaks visibly. Mr. Laurens, has a Brother declining, So that he will go to the  south of France, untill he knows his Brother's Fates I Shall go to  Holland and Stay some time. I may be called to  Paris again, and may take a Tour to  England. Write me, prudently, by any Way. If my Health was firm, I could bear the Uncertainties of Life better. Tell Mrs. Warren I am already quite enough exhausted to retire. If I could, perfectly obey the Precept,  ""Fret not thy self, because of evil Doers,""  I might wear  a little longer. But I forget it sometimes. Mr. Jay has been my Comforter. We have compared Notes, and they agree. I love him so well that I know not what I should do in  Europe without him: Yet how many times have I disputed Sharply with him in Congress! I always thought him however an honest Man. He is a virtuous and religious Man. He has a Conscience, and has been persecuted, accordingly, as all conscientious Men are. Dont suspect me of Cant. I am not addicted to it. He and I have Tales to tell, dismal Tales: But it will be most for his Happiness and mine to forget them. So let them be forgotten. If the publick Good should not absolutely require them to be told. But I am wandering from my  Point which is the Recollection of my fervent affection for my Dearest Friend and the Dear Pledges of her Love. "
"Paris  September 7. 1783.
","My dearest Friend This Morning for the first Time, was delivered me the Resolution of Congress of the first of May, that a Commission and Instructions Should be made Out, to Me,  and Mr. Jay to make a Treaty of Commerce with  Great Britain. If this Intelligence had been Sent Us by Barney, who Sailed from  Philadelphia a Month after, the 1st of May, and has now been Sailed from hence on his return home above a Month it would have Saved me and others much Anxiety. I am now even at a Loss. It is of great Importance that Such a Treaty Should be well made. The Loan in  Holland must be attended to, and when the present one is full, another must be opened, which cannot be done but by me or my Successor. There are other Things too to be done in  Europe  of great Importance. Mr. Laurens has Leave to go home, and Mr. Dana is gone so that there remain in service only Mr. Franklin Mr. Jay and my self. In these Circumstances I must stay another Winter. I cannot justify going home. But what Shall I do for Want of my Family. By what I hear, I think Congress will give Us all Leave to come home in the Spring. Will you come to me this fall and go home with me in the Spring? If you will, come with my dear Nabby, leaving the two Boys at Mr. Shaws, and the House and Place under the Care of your Father Uncle Quincy or Dr. Tufts, or Mr. Cranch.  This Letter may reach you by the first of middle of October, and in November you may embark, and a Passage in November, or all December will be a good Season. You may embark for  London,  Amsterdam, or any Port of  France. On your Arrival, you will find Friends enough. The Moment I hear of it, I will fly with Post Horses to receive you at least, and if the Ballon, Should be carried to such Perfection in the mean time as to give Mankind the safe navigation of the Air, I will fly in one of them at the Rate of thirty Knots an hours This is my Sincere Wish, although the Expence will be considerable, the Trouble to you great and you will probably have to return with me in the Spring. I am So unhappy without you that I wish you would come at all Events. You must bring with you at least one Maid and one Man servant. I must however leave it with your judgment, you know better than I the real Intentions at  Philadelphia, and can determine better than I whether it will be more prudent to wait  the Spring. I am determind to be with you in  America or have you with me in  Europe, as soon as it can be accomplished consistent with private Prudence and the publick Good. I am told that Congress intend to recall Us all, as soon as a few Affairs are finished. If this should be the Case, all will be well. I shall go home with infinite Pleasure. But it may be longer than you think of, before all their necessary Affairs will be dispatched. The Treaty of Commerce with  G. B. must take Time. A Treaty will be wanted with  Portugal and  Denmark if not with the Emperor and Empress. If you come to  Europe this Fall, in my opinion you will be glad to go home in the Spring. If you come in the spring you will wish to return the next fall. I am sure I shall, but Six months of your Company  is worth to me, all the Expences and Trouble of the Voyage. This Resolution of Congress deserves my Gratitude; it is highly  to me, and restores me, my Feelings, which a former Proceeding had taken away I am now perfectly content to be recalled whenever they think fit, or to Stay in  Europe, untill this Business is finished, provided you will come and live with me. We may Spend our Time together in  Paris  London or  the Hague, for 6 or 12 Months as the Public Business may call me and then return to our Cottage, with contented Minds. It would be more agreable to my Inclinations to get home and endeavour to get my self and Children into a Settled Way, but I think it is more necessary for the Publick that I should stay in  Europe, untill this Piece of Business is finished. You dont probably know the Circumstances which attended this Proceeding of Congress. They are so honourable to me, that I cannot in Gratitude or Decency refuse. I must Submit your   Voyage to your Discretion and the Advice of your Friends, my most earnest Wishes are to see you but if the Uncertainties are such as to discourage you, I know it will be upon reasonable Considerations and must submit. But if you postpone the Voyage for this Fall, I shall insist on your coming in the Spring, unless there is a certainty of my going home to you. Congress are at such grievous Expences, that I Shall have no other Secretary than my son. He however is a very good one. He writes a good hand very fast, and is very Steady, to his Pen and his Books. Write me by every Ship to  Spain  France H olland or  England, that I may know. You give me more public Intelligence than any body. The only hint in  Europe of this Commission was from you to yours forever "
"Paris  Septr. 10. 1783
","My dearest Friend The negotiation of a Treaty of Commerce with G.B. will detain me in Europe at least till next Spring. Perhaps longer. If this Letter arrives in Season that you can come this fall, to L'Orient, Amsterdam, or London, I will hasten to receive you as soon as I hear of your arrival. Bring your Daughter, a Man & Maid Servant. Leave the Boys at their School and the Farm in the Care of your Uncle Quincy, Dr. Tufts, your Father,  or other good Friends. It will be attended how ever with Difficulties, and all is yet unsettled in Congress So that we shall probably have to go home together next Spring. I must leave if therefore to the advice of your Friends and your own Judgement to embark this fall or stay till Spring. If affairs should require my stay another summer in Europe I shall insist upon your coming at least in the Spring. "
"Paris  Septr. 10. 1783
","My dearest Friend We have received from Congress a Resolution by which We are to be impowered to negotiate a Treaty of Commerce with  G. B. --  Mr. Franklin and Mr. Jay. This will detain me in  Europe this Winter. If this Letter arrives in Season, that you can come to me this Fall with Miss Nabby I shall be Supreamly happy to see you. But Still Things are so unsettled in Congress that you may expect to return with me in the Spring. You may come to  London  Amsterdam or  L'Orient, to either of which Places I will soon go to receive you after hearing of your Arrival. It is however attended with so many Inconveniences that I must submit it to your Discretion with the Advice of your Friends whether to come this Fall, or stay till Spring and then come in Case Things should not be so altered as to oblige me to came home then to you. I have written more fully by  who sails the 20 of this Month from  L'Orient, in the French Packet to  New York. If you come Leave the Boys at their School, bring a Maid and a Man servant. Leave the Place in the Care of Dr. Tufts or yr father. John is well. "

","My dearest Friend I have had another Fever, which brought me low, but as it has carried off certain Pains and Lamenesses the  of the  Amsterdam Distemper, I am perswaded it will do me, much good. I am going next Week to  London, with . I may Stay Six Weeks, if nothing from Congress calls me away Sooner. I have only to repeat my earnest Request that you and  would come to me, as soon as possible. The Business that is marked out for Us, will detain me in  Europe at least another Year, as I conjecture. You may take the Voyage and Satisfy your Curiosity and return with me. It is not very material, whether you arrive in  Nantes,  Amsterdam or  London -- the Distance from  Paris is about the Same. You, once wrote me that  had offered his Place for Sale. Pray what was his Price? I Suppose that Bills, upon  Europe will now sell for Money or more than Money. If So draw upon me, for what you want, and your Bills shall be paid, upon Sight.   I Sent you a little by Mr. Thaxter. I have particular Reasons for wishing to own that Piece of Land where  Mr. Hancocks House stood and the Addition which has been made to it. If he Coll. Quincy will Sell it, at any tollerable Price, and you can sell a Bill upon me, for Cash to pay for it, buy it. Pray Dr. Tufts to do it, if you have not time. Your Letters by the Way of  England have all come to me very regularly and in good order. It is the best Way at present of Writing. You may write however, by the Way of the French Packet from  N. York to  L'Orient. But Secrets should not be trusted to that Conveyance by you nor me. The Family affair which has been mentioned in Several of your Letters, may be managed very well.  comes to  Europe with you. If the Parties preserve their Regard untill they meet again and continue to behave as they ought, they will be still young enough. Lawyers should never marry early. I am quite unqualified to decide upon that matter. To Your judgment, with the Advice of our Friends, I must leave it. One Thing I know, that Knowledge of the Law comes not by Inspiration, and without painfull and obstinate Study no Man will ever have it.  "

","My dearest Friend Yours of  10 to Mr. Robbins, he shewed me this Moment and informs Me, he goes on Board on Monday. I regret that I have had no earlier Knowledge of this young Gentleman.

[But this Government?] It is a fine Country; but it is undone by Prosperity. It has the Vertigo in the Head, yet. Yesterday a Letter from  informed me of the Death of my dear and honoured Father.

","My dearest Friend I have this Day, by Special Permission from their Majesties obtained by  the Painter who with Mr. Copely do so much honour to our Country, Seen the Appartements in the  Queens House, as it is called, or  Buckingham House. It is a great Curiosity indeed. There is an inestimable Collection of Paintings by the greatest Masters, Raphael, Rubens, Vandyke, and many others. There is one Room which the King calls , as it is ornamented with a Collection of his Works -- the Return of Regulus -- The Death of Epaminondas -- The Death of Bayard -- The Death of General Wolf? -- and &c. The Cartons of Raphael, are a  Production of Art. The Library is the most elegant Thing I ever saw. But the Kings Military and Naval Room, pleased me best as it is a Collection of Plans, and Models of every Dockyard, Fortress and Man of War in his Empire. Come to  Europe with  as soon as possible, and Satisfy your Curiosity, and improve your Taste, by viewing these magnificent Sceenes. Go to the Play -- see the Paintings and Buildings -- visit the Manufactures for a few Months -- and then, if Congress pleases return to  America with me to reflect upon them. I am in earnest. I cannot be happy, nor tolerable without you. Besides I really think one Trip across the Sea would be of Service to you and  to whom my Love. I Shall expect you constantly untill you arrive. I mourn the Loss of my Father, but it was time to expect it, from his Age. You must be  and afflicted, and I hope that the Voyage, will divert your Thoughts.  is in  America before this no doubt. My dear Son, is the only Secretary, I have or propose to have at present. I believe I Shall go to  the Hague, and reside chiefly there but write to me untill you embark by  Portugal  Spain  France  England or  Holland. The nearer you Arrive to  the Hague, the nearer I believe you will be to me, yet I may be in  Paris. I shall stay  but a Short time in  London. You will read in the Newspapers, innumerable  about Jay and me. Regard them as little as I do. I have met with an agreable Reception here, as agreable as I wish. In short I have been received here, exactly as I wished to be. Yours with Tenderness unutterable  "

","Dearest Friend I have time only to inform you that We are well, and to repeat my earnest Wish and Expectation to see you as soon as possible. Draw upon me for Whatever Money You want and it shall be paid at Sight. I have been invited by the Duke of Portland and  to See them and I have Seen them and Mr. Burke  [and] met a cordial Reception from all three. These would  [do?] right if they governed. But I am not certain, they are not Sometimes overruled or overawed. Comfort yourself for the Loss of  amiable and excellent as he was.

"The Hague  Jan. 25. 1784
","My dearest Friend I was much disappointed, on the Arrival of  in  London, at not finding a Letter from you, but last Week at  Amsterdam, I had the Happiness to receive your kind favours of  Sept. 20.  and  Oct. 19.  Mr. Trumbull is not arrived. The Loss of my kind Father, has very tenderly affected me, but I hope, with full Confidence to meet him in a better World. My ever  Mother I still hope to see in this. I feel for you, as I know how justly dear  [to] you, your father was. You have Seen, before now  and I hope Mr. Dana. The Determinations of Congress, upon the Arrival of the definitive Treaty, will be your best Guide for your own Conduct. You will juge best from thence whether it is worth your while to come to  The Hague or to  Europe. If Congress sh would determine to continue me in  Europe, I must intreat you to come to me, for I assure you, my Happiness depends so much upon it, that I am determined, if you decline coming to me, to come to you. If Miss Nabby is attached, to  Braintre, and you think, upon Advizing with your Friends, her Object worthy, marry her if you will and leave her with her Companion in your own House, Office, Furniture Farm and all.  [His] Profession is, the very one, I wish. His  [Connections] are respectable, and if he has Sown his  [wild] Oats  and will Study, and mind his Business, he is all I want. I must at present leave all to your judgment. If you think it not  to come to  Europe, I will come to you, although I should be Sorry, to break away and return, without Permission from Congress. I should not care, a Farthing my self whether it were in  England or  Holland, if I could preserve my Health, which I should hope to do with my Family in a settled Way of Life, for I am determined, not to venture in future upon Such Journeys and Wanderings as have heretofore been necessary, and have done me so much harm. Somewhere or other, I am determined to have a regular Habitation and Settled Abode.  is a great Comfort to me. He is every Thing you could wish him. Wholly devoted to his studies he has made a Progress, which gives me intire Satisfaction. Miss N's  [Nabby's] Friend must rise very early or he will be soon overtaken by her worthy Brother. In the Course of two or three Years, John must go home, and go into some Office, and if he should have a Brother in Law of sufficient Merit, why should he wish for any other Master? These Things are but Speculations. Miss hopes I shall approve of her Taste. I can Scarcely think it possible for me to disapprove, of her final Judgment formed with deliberation, upon any Thing which so deeply concerns her whole Happiness. But she will listen to the Advice of her Mother Grandmother, and her Aunts, in whose Wisdom I have great Confidence. The next Dispatches from Congress, and from you, after  Arrival will determine me and I shall write you more fully. I have enjoyed better Health, Since my Fever last  at  Paris. I got poisoned at  Amsterdam with the Steams of the Canals, and bad Water in the Cisterns, and my Constitution has been labouring, these two or three Years to throw it off. Two violent Fevers, have not been Sufficient, wholly to relieve me, but the last has made me better. I am cured of the Imprudence of living in a great City in hot Weather.  "
"The Hague  July 3. 1784
","My Dearest Friend From the first of April to this time, I have been in constant and anxious Expectation of hearing of your Arrival in  London. Your Letters encouraged me to hope and expect it, otherwise I should have been with you at  Braintree before now. I still expect to hear of your arrival every moment, but as  your last letters  by  expressed a doubt, it is possible, even that this Letter may find you in  America. If it does, I shall leave it to your discretion, to embark or not, if you embark, burn the inclosed. But notwithstanding that you will probably have to return again to  America in the Spring with me, if you do not embark, send the enclosed on to the President of Congress, and I will be at home as soon as I can. But I fear it will not be before the Spring, perhaps not before June or July; if you conclude to come to me, you may marry your Daughter beforehand if you will and bring her Husband with her. If you do not come, you may still  marry your Daughter if you think proper. My own Opinion is, you had better Stay. I will come home, and make my Hill shine as bright as , and leave Politicks to those who understand them better and delight in them more, Breed my Boys, to the Bar and to Business, and My Girls too, and live and die in primaeval simplicity and Innocence. You may depend upon it, I will not be jockied again.  Yours &c. "

","My dearest Friend Your Letter of the 23d.  has made me the happiest Man upon  Earth. I am twenty Years younger than I was Yesterday. It is a cruel Mortification to me that I cannot go to meet you in  London, but there are a Variety of Reasons decisive against it, which I will communicate to you here. Meantime, I Send you  who is the greatest Traveller, of his Age, and without Partiality, I think as promising and manly a youth as is in the World. He will purchase a Coach, in which We four must travel to  Paris. Let it be large and Strong, with an Imperial, and Accommodations for travelling. I wish you to See  the Hague before you go to  France. The Season is  both here and in  England. The journey here will be pleasant excepting an Hour or two of Sea sickness between   Harwich and  Helvoet Sluis. You may come conveniently with your two Children and your Maid, in the Coach, and your Man may ride on Horseback, or in the Stage Coach. I can give you no Council, about . Mr. Puller will furnish the Money you want, upon your Order or Receipt. Expences I know will be high but they must be born, and as to Cloaths for yourself and Daughter, I beg you to do what is proper let the Expence be what it will. Every Hour to me will be a Day, but dont you hurry, or fatigue or disquiet yourself upon the journey. Be  of your Health. After Spending a Week or two here, you will have to set out with me to  France, but there are no Seas between, a good Road a fine season and We will make moderate  Journeys and See the Curiosities of Several Cities in our Way --  Utrecht,  Breda,  Antwerp,  Brussells &c &c. It is the first Time in  Europe that I looked forward to a Journey with Pleasure. Now, I promise myself a great deal. I think it lucky that I am to go to  Paris where you will  have an opportunity to see that City, to acquire its Language &c. It will be more agreable to you to be there, than here perhaps for some time. For my own Part I think myself made for this World. But this very Idea makes me feel for  who have lately seperated. If my Consent only is Wanting they shall be asunder no longer than they choose. But We must consult upon Plans about this. They have discovered a Prudence. Let this Prudence continue and All will be right by and by  "
"The Hague  Aug. 1. 1784
","My dearest Friend Your  without a Date , just now received and Mr. Jeffersons Arrival, a Month sooner than he expected, have indeed changed my Plan. Stay where you are, and amuse yourself, by Seeing what you can, untill you See me. I will be with you in Eight Days at farthest, and sooner, if possible. I will cross from  Helvoet to  Harwich, by the Packet of the day after tomorrow if I can. If this is impossible, by the next. I must take Leave, here, and write to  Paris and arrange my Household, as well as I can before I depart. But I will join you in  London.  Let your Son buy his Coach, and have every Thing ready, to depart for  Dover, for I cannot Stay a Day in  London. I must join my Colleagues in  Paris without Loss of Time. Your Daughter may write her Freind as favourably as she pleases. I wrote him on the 3 of April my Approbation of his Views, and hoped he had the Letter before you Sailed.  "

","My dearest Friend I hope you have had a Pleasant Journey and are happy in your tour. I am, in a State of  Solitude, that has hitherto been very tolerable, because I know my Treasures are not far off. But, as soon as the Novelty of it, wears off, and my occupation shall cease it will grow tedious enough. Dont hurry yourself however nor your Friends, but improve the opportunity to see, whatever you have an Inclination to see. I shall receive the Benefit of your Observations when We meet and with more Pleasure than I could have made them perhaps in Person. Love to the Coll and my  Nabby Smith, and Compliments to all the Party. A Letter from Squire Storer is .

I shall do very well -- if I am cold in the night, and an additional quantity of Bed Cloaths will not answer the purpose of warming me, I will take a Virgin to bed with me. -- Ay a Virgin. -- What? Oh Awful! What do she read? Dont be . -- Do you know what a Virgin is? Mr. Bridget brought me acquainted with it this Morning. It is a Stone Bottle, Such as you buy with Spruce Beer and Spa Water, filled with Boiling Water, covered over and wrapped up in flannel and laid at a Mans Feet in Bed. -- An Old Man you see may comfort himself with Such a Virgin, as much as David did with Abishay, and not give the least Jealousy even to his  to his Wife, the smallest grief to his Children, or any Scandal to the World. -- Tell Mr. Bridgen when you see him that I am indebted to him for this important Piece of Knowledge, which I would not sell for a great deal of Money. Tell  I am half disposed to be almost miffed with him -- for going off without giving me his Letter about the Indians. -- And what compleats the Mischief is, that he has all the Books locked up in his Room. Pray him to write me, if it is possible to get at the Letter or the Books -- both are what I want. -- My Love to Nabby Smith and her Knight -- and to all the Party. Mr. Shippin is with you eer now. He was so good as to pick a bone with me once, -- and Mr. Cutting is very good. We now talk Politicks all alone and are much cooler and more rational than when We dispute in Company. .   "

The News from  Boston is very well. The Court has set at  Cambridge in great Pomp guarded by three thousand Men and a train of Artillery. The General Court have passed an Amnesty, with some Exceptions, to all who will take the oath of Allegiance, in a certain Time. The  Governor reviewed the Troops and made them a Speech, in short government appears now in its Majesty supported by those in whom all Majesty originally resides, the People. I have not seen the Papers but Coll Trumbal gives me this Account. Coll Smiths Toast ""common sense to the Common People"" is already verified.

"Amsterdam  June 1. 1787
","My dearest Friend We are lodged in our old Chamber at  Amsterdam, and Sleep as soundly as if there were not a dozen houses plundered every night. The two nights before the last were very Seditious. Last night was quiet, and the Precautions which Secured the Peace then, will be continued, so  all will be still. Dont be anxious for Us, nor believe half the Reports that will be circulated. Such Events are often exaggerated at first. Mr. Cutting and myself are very Safe. The Party for the Prince, appears to be So feeble in  Amsterdam, that every thing will be quieted, very soon. I cannot Say when We shall return, but I believe We Shall recross from Helvoet to  Harwick, by next Wednesdays Packet, so that you  may expect Us by Friday or Saturday. Yet We may be detained a Week longer. I have accomplished the Business I came upon, and have this Day signed the Contract for a Million of Guilders at five Per Cent, so that Congress will be at ease for another Year. My Love to , and a Kiss for my Grand Boy. My Libel is much applauded here. They call it ""The Breviary of Liberty, Safety and good order"" a Compliment more flattering to me, than all the Ingenuity of my own Self Love and Vanity, could have invented. .   "
"Amsterdam  Saturday June 2. 1787
","My dearest Friend I wrote you Yesterday, that I had executed the Contract and Should return to England by the Packet of Wednesday the Sixth of June. But as the Money Lenders, whether to make a mere Compliment to me, whether to  their Patriotism, or whether from simple Caprice, made it an original Condition that my Name should be Subscribed to all the Obligations, as it was in the first loan, instead of being Signed only once before the Notary Public, as it was in the last, I shall be detained till Tuesday in  Amsterdam. Two thousand Signatures will take me two Days, for altho I once wrote my name 2500 times in one day, I would not do it again, for more Money than I ever got by all my Loans,that is to Say for nothing. -- I shall not now be able to embark at Helvoet, before Saturday or the following Wednesday. I am grieved for Mr. Barclay and his amiable Family but can give them no relief. The two last nights have been quiet: but I am told that near thirty houses have been rifled. -- Some Persons of note have decamped, and discoveries are Said to have been made, but I give little Credit to what I hear, because Reports at such times are given out, with design: and I am not in any Secret, because I will not be. I am but a Passenger. -- It is given out that there will be Seven Executions this Morning. A Scene that my Nerves are not in tune to see. One Truth is now manifest to all, namely that the  Party, is all powerful at  Amsterdam, and consequently the Prince must comply, or do worse.

Mr. Dumas prays me to send you his respects.   My Cockade is splendid enough for a Lt. General. Mr. Dumas is large enough for a Colonell, or for what I know for a Major General. I have not seen one Person without an orange Ribbon. Great Preparations are making for celebrating the Birth day: and all is quiet. Tomorrow I make my first Visit, Give my Love to Mr. and Mrs. Smith and to my dear boy -- and my Respects and Compliments to all Friends. .  "

Mr. Jefferson at the Receipt of your Letter, came post to meet me, and he outts out So Much Business for me, to put the Money Matters of the  United States upon a sure footing, that I certainly  shall not be able to get into the Packet at  Helvoet before Saturday; and I much fear not before wednesday the Nineteenth. This delay is very painful to me, and you must blame your self for it, altogether. I thought myself dead, and that it was well with me, as a Public Man; but I think I shall be forced, after my decease, to open an additional Loan, at least this is  opinion and that of Mr. Van Staphorst. I hope you will have every Thing ready that by the twenty first or second of March We may  off together for  falmouth from London. My Love to , and kiss my dear Boy. Compliments to all Friends. I am very impatient under this unforseen delay, but our Bankers as well as Mr. Jefferson think it absolutely necessary for the Public. I must therefore submit, but, if in  Consequence of it you should meet the South Waters on the  Coast of America, and have your Voyage prolonged three Weeks by it, remember it is all your own Intrigue, which has forced me to open this Loan. I suppose you will boast of it, as a great Public Service, .  "

I was very much averse to this but he would take no denial. I shall therefore be detained here till Monday. But if my Health continues I shall cross over in the Packett of next Wednesday. I hope every Thing will be ready for us to take Post for Falmouth. The Rich complain, at present in  Holland that the Poor are set over them in the Regencies and the old Families that they are set aside by new ones. Discontent rankles deep in Some Places, and among some Sorts of Men: but the Common People appear to be much pleased. The Patriots in this Country, were little read in History less in Government: knew little of the human heart and still less of the world. They have therefore been the Dupes of foreign , and their own indigested systems. Changes may happen and disorders may break out,  at present there is no apparent Probability of either. But as there is no sense of the Necessity of uniting and combining the great divisions of Society in one system, no changes can happen for the better.

If he cannot, I must send your oldest son, with a Coach from Boston, to wait on you. As soon as I can receive a Letter from you, informing me, of the Necessity of it, I will Send him off. I expect him every day from Newbury Port. All has gone very well at home, and all your Friends are in health. Your sisters Family are in affliction by the Death of Gen. Palmer.  You will not expect from me, much upon Public affairs.

This gives Us a comfortable Prospect of a good , which is all that will be necessary to our Happiness. Yet I fear that confused and ill digested Efforts at Amendments will perplex for sometime.

At Horseneck, we were met by Major Pintard, and Captain Mandeville with a Party of Horse from the  State of New York, and there is to be much Parade on Monday. Before this I presume, the Printers in  Boston, have inserted in their Gazettes, the Debates of the House or Representatives, which are conducted with open Galleries. This Measure, by making the Debates public will establish the national Government, or break the Confederation. I can conceive of no medium between these Extremes.

Mr. Jay with his usual Friendship, has insisted on my taking Apartments in his noble house. No Provision No arrangement, has been made for the President or Vice P. and I see, clearly enough, that Minds are not conformed to the Constitution, enough, as yet, to do any Thing, which will support the Government in the Eyes of the People or of Foreigners.

I shall be ready in the House to receive you. I Should advise  to Stay and deliver his French oration: but if he chooses to come on with you I shall be glad to See him. If he Stays Brisler must come with you. I dont see any necessity of his going in the Vessell with the Furniture. But in all Events my health is so disordered that I cannot consent to your delaying any longer.  indeed might come on with you, and return to take his Degree. Mrs. Smith has promised me that I shall sleep in the House next Thursday night. "

","My dearest Friend Mr. Dalton, Mr. Jankes and myself are at  Penfields in good health and Spirits. My Horses perform very well and my servant tolerably. We have met With nothing but Rocks in the Road to molest Us, These have jolted Us very rudely but salubriously. I shall keep Mr. Dalton company to Boston at least to  Cambridge. According to present conjectures We shall Spend the Sabbath at  Springfield, My Love to my Young Lawyer, and all the rest.    "

","My dearest Friend I thank you for your kind Letter  that from our Friend Hollis. The Influenza is here as general as it was at  N. York. Your youngest Son has been laid up with it at Mr. Cranch's; but is better. Mr. Wibirt is confined with it, so that we had no Meeting. I have been to visit him: He is not very bad; but not fit to go out. My great Horse, had a Misfortune last Night in the Stable, that he will not get over this fortnight. I am thankful that he is alive. Mr. Brisler is preparing his Goods to go by barnard, who Sails on , and will go with his Family   next Week in the Stage. I have Spent a Week in  Boston which I have not done before these sixteen years.  between Sam. Adams and John, The Fratrum dulce Par, mounted up to View in the Stone Chapell and in Concert Hall to be Sure was a Spectacle for the  Town of Boston. The Remarks were very shrewd. Behold three Men, Said one, who can make a Revolution when they please. There Said another are the three genuine Pivots of the Revolution. The First of these observations is not I hope so true as I fear the last is. Of all the Pictures that ever were or ever will be taken this ought to be done with the greatest Care, and preserved in the best Place. But H.'s Creatures will cast a Damper upon that. The Presidents  was in Character, and consequently charming to all. I write no Particulars, because the News papers will give you the details. His Reception has been cordial and Splendid. His Journey will do much public good. I Shall return, in the first Week in December, if not sooner, and bring  with me. You must be very prudent and cautious, of my Letters. Let them be seen by none, but the Family; for altho I shall write no harm there are Chemists who are very skilful in extracting evil out of Good. I have Seen   the new Mrs. Tufts, and admire the Drs. taste. She is in appearance, a fine Woman.   "

","My dearest Friend I am impatient to return but partly on Account or my Son who wishes to Stay at College as long as he can,  and partly, on account of my Books and other Things which I wish to get ready be fore I go, to be sent to  N. Y. I fear I shall not see you these three Weeks. I should however break away if I were not necessitated to wait for my horse, whose Lameness is not wholly cured. Excepting the Influenza which is universal our Relations and Freinds are all very well. The Accident to my horse, has been a vexatious Thing and has deprived me of half the Pleasure and half the Exercise I intended. This Horse I am told got cast in the same Stable last year. My Farm I found as I expected -- poor enough. I live with my Mother and Brother and We live like Princes, in great Luxury. You know my Mother. She has the Influenza, severely; but is very active. The President is at Home eer now, no doubt.  Mr. Brisler is arrived I hope without any Accident with his Family. This will be some Relief to Us, as it will take off much care from your mind. I wish I could send boys and Girls from home, to supply all the Places in the House that you want filled. There is a Calm a Silence and a  that is very remarkable in this Part of the Continent. May it be equal at the southward and long continue in both! i. e. may we be enabled to live Satisfaction to the Multitude of our Brothers. "

","My dearest Friend  The Weather has been so  and the Roads so bad, that I have not been able to advance farther on my Journey than to Bulls Tavern in this Town where I arrived last night after an unpleasant ride in the snow from  Springfield. It Snowed all last night and has blocked up the roads so that I cannot move onwards till Monday. I fallen into Several curious Conversations, on the road, which however would be too trifling to commit to Paper. A Gentleman of very respectable Appearance told me last Evening without knowing or Suspecting me, all the  of  New York and  Philadelphia for and against the V. President.  ""The V. P. had been as all Acknowledged a great Friend to this Country, but had given Offence to his Fellow Citizens in  Massachusetts, by writing something in favour of hereditary descent. That he had  been long in  Europe and got tainted."" I told him laughing that it was hard if a Man could not go to  Europe without being tainted, that if Mr. Adams had been Sent to  Europe upon their Business by the People, and had done it, and in doing it had necessarily got tainted I thought the People ought to pay him for the Damage the Taint had done him, or find some Means to wash it out and cleanse him. Governor H. has been here and made a Dinner for the Gentlemen of this Town. One asked after the V. P.  ""The Governor has not Spoken to the V. P. this year. He was not one of the Well born."" A Gentleman remarked upon it afterwards What would Mr. H. have been if he had not been well born the Nephew of the rich Uncle Thomas? In short his Silly Envy of the V. P. is perceived and ridiculed by all the World out of  Massachusetts. He is considered as a mere rich Man prodigal of his Wealth to obtain an empty Bubble of Popularity. I am told that an unanimous Vote will be for me in  Vermont  New Hampshire,  Connecticut and  Rhode Island. This is generally expected, but I know full well the Uncertainty of Such Things, and am prepared to meet an Unanimous Vote against me. Mr. P.E.  came off miserably. He gave such Offence by mentioning his Nephew, that they would not appoint one Man who had any connection with him. I would not entertain you with this political Title tattle if I had  of more importance to say. One Thing of more importance to me, but no News to you is that I am Yours with unabated Esteem and affection forever .  "

","My dearest Friend  At  Hartford, finding the Roads obstructed with Such Banks of Snow, as were impassable with Wheels I left my Chaise with Mr. Frederick Bull of that town to be sent to  Boston, and my Horses to be sent after me, and took to the Mail Stage. We happened to have  Passengers, and arrived here on Wednesday night. As I had little Sleep for several nights, I found myself fatigued, a little fevourish with a bad Sore throat, and have been nursing here till Sunday. Tomorrow morning I go off for  Philadelphia. Charles and our Friends are well. Some Persons have received letters from our Children in  London who expect to come home in the Spring. Governor Clinton is to be V. P. of H.S. and Govr. of N. Y. too, at least this is the sanguine  both of his Friends and Enemies. Some of both I mean.  The C. J. has been very Sick but is recovered. He looks very thin and pale however. Charles has had some Business, and has argued and gained his first Cause. It is no Small Thing to make the Beginning at the Bar. He wants Books and I must help him to purchase a few of the most necessary. I wrote you from  Hartford and shall write again from  Philadelphia. I hear many Stories of Marches and Countermarches Intrigues and  of Burke Dallas, Edwards Clinton &c &c to form Combinations vs. the V. P. but I know not how much of it to Credit. At all Events I hope I shall not be obliged to lie alone next Winter, and with this Wish I close my Letter,    "

","My dearest Friend Last night I arrived at  Philadelphia in tolerable Health and found our Friends all well, I have concluded to accept of the kind offer of Mr. and Mrs. Otis and taken a bed in their House. Thomas is charmingly accommodated and is very well. This Day decides whether I shall be a Farmer or a Statesman after next March. They have been flickering in the Newspapers and caballing in Parties: but how the result will be I neither know nor care, I have met a very cordial and friendly reception from the Senate. All lament that  is not here: but none of them so much as her Friend forever,  "

","My dearest Friend I am lodged at Mr. Otis's and am personally well accommodated: but I am So little pleased with living alone at any Lodgings, that this shall be the last time. You must come to me another Year or I will come to you. I am convinced if you were now here you would again be sick for the damp and chill is very penetrating, Next fall, I hope your health will be better. How the Election is gone I know not. It cannot go amiss for me, because I am prepared for every Event. Indeed I am of the Cat kind and fall upon my feet, throw me as they will. I hear some very good Stories to this purpose sometimes.  Benson propagates a beautiful Anecdote of this kind. A large Company mixed of Federalists and Antis, Whigs and Tories, Clintonians and Jaysites were together at  New York in Conversation about French Affairs. All Parties it seems condemned and execrated the Plans and Conduct of the Jacobins. Unluckily at length a Jaysite and Federalist observed that We had Jacobins in this Country who were pursuing objects as pernicious by means as unwarrantable as those of  France. This roused the Resentment of a Clintonian Anti whose name is Gilbert Livingston, who took the Reflection to himself and his Party and grew warm,  ""Nothing says he mortifies me so much in the misconduct in  France and  America too, as to see that the Fools are all playing the Game into the hands of that Mr. John Adams."" Why Said Benson to Livingston who  is a serious Man. Mr. Adams reads the  Scriptures and there he finds that Man is as stupid as the Wild Asses Colt. He believes what he reads and infers his necessary Consequences from it. That is all. Mr. Adams is not to blame. He did not write the Scriptures, He only reads and believes. Benson got the laugh upon Livingston but I love Livingston the better for the story. It  Integrity and Candor at Bottom, 'tho Prejudice and Party Spirit were att top. The President and Lady and all others  anxiously and affectionately for You. I have given Charles my Coach Horses to buy him Law Books, For the future your Pair of Horses will be all I shall keep. My Love to all.   "

","My dearest Friend  Dr. Blair has resigned and Dr. Green is our Chaplain, but Miss Blair is married to Mr. Roberdeau the Bearer of this Letter, son of my old Friend the General. There is an universal and respectful Inquiry after you and your health, and as general a respect and Attention  to me. The Savages who shoot from the Swamps and thickets, from the Brakes and Briars from the Mud and Dirt, are all hidden Skulkers, and dare not shew their heads or make known their Names. You will know more of the Election before this reaches you than. I do. It does not appear that I am born to so good Fortune as to be a mere Farmer in my Old Age notwithstanding the kind Intentions and benevolent Endeavours of some People to excuse me from future Journeys.  Your Son and your Friends are all well. I dont know whether I have told you that I came from  Hartford in the Stage, that I have given my Horses to Charles to buy Law Books.  "

","My dearest Friend Your Account of our little domestic affairs and the Arrangements of the Farm, was very entertaining to me, and I hope you will continue to inform me of every occurrence of any consequence. I should be glad to know who is engaged to take the Care of the Place this Winter: What prospect you have of hiring a Man in the Spring by the Year: and your opinion whether I had not better engage a complete farmer in the County of  Worcester or  Hampshire. None however are  to some in  Bridgwater. I am very comfortable at Mr. Otis's. Thomas is very well and very good. My Friends have been more anxious than I have been about a certain Reelection. There has  been an Ardour upon this Occasion among all the Friends of the Constitution, order and good Government, which I did not expect. The Votes of  New Jersey have been unanimous both for President and V. P. Those of  Pensilvania were unanimous for P. and 14 out of 15 for V. P. It is reported, but not certain that  Delaware and  Maryland were unanimous. It is almost an universal Opinion that  N.Y. will be unanimous for Clinton? merely to give him an Ecclat and to shew their disapprobation of the V. P. without even a hope or a wish, to have C. elected. I am not however clear that they will be unanimous. The Virginians and N. Carolinians are Said to be zealous against the V. P. not, as some of them say, that they wish to get him out, but to shew a marked disapprobation of his Politicks. But enough of this Electioneering Stuff. My Duty to my Mother and Love to Louisa and all friends. Tell my Brother that I hope he will Use his  best Endeavours that; Mr. Strong may be reelected. He is an excellent head and heart. They cannot do better.    "

","My dearest Friend Your  of the 4th  arrived by Yesterdays post. The Votes on the important day you mention, are now known to have been unanimous as far as  Cheasapeak Bay, excepting one in  Pensilvania and all in  New York. The whole Flock in  Virginia as well as in  N.Y. were for Mr. Clinton. They tell me it is a  Tryumph of Foederalism over Antifoederalism: but I own I can See no Tryumph in obtaining more Votes than Mr. Clinton: if the Services of J. A. can be compared to those of G. C. if the Sacrifices, if the Sufferings, if the Talents of the Experience, if the Knowledge if one can be brought down to a Comparison with the other, it is high time to quit Such a service. There is not the Smallest degree of Vanity in this. In one Point only will I allow that his Merit is superiour to mine: he has had more Sense than I have in feathering his nest, and making Provision for his Children. Lucius and Marius, after whom you   I have never read and know not their Writers. I give myself no trouble about such Writings, as are personal against one. The Plan has been concerted, the Agents and Instruments mustered from  Georgia to  N. H. The Misrepresentations to the southward have been as gross as they have been numerous: in short they have plainly  an opinion that all their hopes were suspended on the Removal of one Man from office. Mr. Parker of  Virginia, I am told boasts that the Plan was his own and Mr. Burke of  S. C. Mr. Dallas of this Town, Mr. P. Edwards of  New Haven are reported to have been his principal CoadJutants. The Prices of Rye and Flour are as high in Proportion here as at  Boston: but Brisler will  particularly and write the Result. You have many Friends who  affectionatly after your health and all regret, that you cannot be here. Thomas is very hearty and well Spoken of. It would not be prudent to enter very minutely into the Anecdotes which the late Electioneering has produced, but Some of them are very curious. Judge Cushing and Judge Griffin were divided in opinion on the Cause of so much Expectation in  Virginia, which will continue sometime Longer the Effervescence in that State and produce Admirers of Clinton from an hatred to  Jay, and me.

"Philadelphia  Decr. 28. 1792
","My dearest Friend  Your Friends who are numerous  continually after your health and my Answer is that you have not informed me that it is worse, from which my conclusion is that I hope it is better. The Noise of Election is over, and I have the Consolation to find that all the States which are  have been unanimous for me, and all those in which the Antifederalists were the predominant Party, unanimous against me: from whence my Vanity concludes that both Parties think me decidedly foederal and of Some consequence. Four years more will be as long as I shall have a Taste for public Life or Journeys to  Philadelphia. I am determined in the meantime to be no longer the Dupe, and run into Debt to Support a vain Post which has answered no other End than to make me unpopular. The Southern States I find as bitter against Mr. Jay as they are against me and I suppose for the same Reason. I am  to find how little Popularity Mr. Hancock has in any of the States out of  Mass.  [Massachusetts].  Mr. Pierpoint Edwards has been here: although he did not vouchsafe me the honour of a Visit or a Card, he was seen in close Consultation at his Lodgings with Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Baldwin. I am really astonished at the blind Spirit of Party which has Lived on the whole soul of this Jefferson. There is not a Jacobin in  France more devoted to Faction. He is however Selling off his Furniture and his Horses: He has been I believe a greater fool than I have, and run farther into Debt by his French Dinners and Splendid Living. Farewell for me all that Folly forever. Jefferson may for what I know pursueing my example and finding the Blanket too short taking up his feet. I am sure all the officers of Government must hall in their horns as I have done. Mr. Ingersoll has Wrote me for his Fee with Thomas and I must pay it, if the House make any Appropriation.

","My dearest Friend  Who is that Justice Cooper who read the Riot Act? The Town Clerk or his Son? If the Mob Swore they had the Governors Orders to pull down the Theater, I shall  that the Mob swore to a lie: for it is impossible that the Governor should have given Such orders or such Leave. I don't see that the Governor was under any kind of Obligation or Necessity make Use of the harsh measures he so pathetically laments. All that could have been required or expected of him, would have been to have given orders to the Attorney General to prosecute and all that could have been required of the Attorney General would have been to have laid an Indictment before the Grand Jury, or at most to have taken one of the Players a Warrant and had him recognized to Answer. But to shock the Feelings of half the Town by so open an Indignity is thought by all who Speak of it here a Work of . Your Absense is much regretted in Words and in reality. You have many Sincere friends in this Town. Mrs. Washington Mrs. Powell, Mrs. Morris, Mrs. Dalton and many other Ladies have Spoken to me upon the SubJect of your Absence, with a respect I am sure came from the heart. The result of the election has demonstrated that the Government and not the Man nor his Writings  was the hated Object. The Foederal Interest has been unanimous for and the Antifoederal, against my Re election. This Line has been marked with an Obstinate decision which proves that both parties were Of Opininion the Question was no less than whether the Government should Stand or fall. In this probably they were both too Sanguine. If Clinton, however had been chosen the Administration would have been so much changed that the Government might have found its dissolution much sooner. This Personal Ennemy of Hamilton was selected more from opposition to him than to me, and as much from opposition to Jay as to either. The Debtors dread Jay, as well as me. I am glad to see Shaw continues to cart seaweed; I hope it will not forget to give frequently fresh bedding to such as Sleep upon it in the yard.  "

","My dearest Friend Our Antifederal Scribblers are so fond of Rotations that they seem disposed to remove their Abuses from me to the President. Baches Paper which is nearly as bad as Frencaux's begins to join in concert with it, to maul the president for his Drawing Rooms, Levees, declining to accept of Invitations to Dinners and Tea Parties, his  Odes, Visits, Compliments &c. I may be expected to be an Advocate for a Rotation of Objects of Abuse, and for Equality in this particular. I have held the office, of Libellee General long enough: The Burthen of it ought to be participated and equallized according to modern republican Principles. The News from  France, so glorious for the French Army, is celebrated in loud Peals of Festivity and elevates the Spirits of the  of Government among us more than it ought, for it will not answer their ends. We shall now see the Form of the French Republick.  Their conventions will have many Tryals to make before they will come at any thing permanent. The Calamities of  France are not over. I shall claim the Merit of some little Accuracy of foresight when I see General Lincoln, who you remember was inclined to think the Duke of Brunswick march to  Paris certain, while I was very apprehensive that the numerous fortified Towns in his Way would waste his army and consume the . We shall soon see the Operation in  France of Elections to first Magistracies. My Attention is fixed to this Object. I have no doubt of its Effects: but it is a curious Question how long they can last. We have lately seen how they have  in  New York and What effect that Election has had upon the Votes for President. Cabal, Intrigue, Manoeuvre as bad as any Species of Corruption We have already seen in our Elections, and when and where will they stop? "
"Philadelphia  January 8. 1793
","My Dearest Friend Your kind Letters of  23.  and 29 , arrived Yesterday by the Post. You Seem disposed to write to me on the Subject of a late Election and therefore I Suppose a little Egotism from me will not be very disgusting to you. You expected half the Votes from the other five States one of them only,   has vouchsafed me a Vote.  V. N.C. G. K. and  N.Y. appear to have been wholly governed by the Section Poissoniere, in this Election. There is no End of the Fictions and Falshoods which were propagated and not contradicted in those remote States. I will tell you one from the Mouth of Mr. Lear. A Mr. Basset I think who married a Sister of Mrs. Washingtons told the President, that it was propagated and believed in  Virginia that the Vice President was always in Opposition to the President, and that all the Opposition which was ever made to him in Senate originated with the V.P.. The President answered his Brother in Law that as to Some Things which had been reported he could Say nothing because he knew nothing. But this he could Say and would Say was a Lie for to his Knowledge so far from opposing him in Senate, the V.P.  [Vice President] had always Supported him. Another Anecdote I have from Judge Cushing and his Lady, who dined at  Richmond in Company with Patrick Henry, Arthur Lee, and many other Gentlemen Young and  old on the 5th of December the day of the Election. Patrick Henry was pleased to harrangue upon my subject. He had formerly had the Pleasure of an agreable Acquaintance with Mr. Adams and had an Esteem and regard from him, but he was much surprized and very Sorry to find that he had written and published such Books and then went on to preach against the Books, and proved only that he knew nothing about them. Judge Cushing perceiving this asked him dryly if he had read those Volumes? He answered No. Cushing recommended them to his Perusal. No he was too old to read so extensive a Work as three Volumes. He took his Account of them he Said from those young Gentlemen pointing to some in Company; Some of whom then Spoke up, and said they had read the Work or some Part of it, when they were Boys at Colledge, and despized and abhorred it. Arthur Lee then Spoke up and Said  ""They must have been Boys then, for it was the Work of the greatest Genius that had ever been written in this Country."" These last dying Words of my Friend Arthur Lee, very tenderly affected me, both as proofs of his Independence and his personal Friendship. Trumbull the Painter, was lately in Company with Mr. Giles at Miss Nancy Allens. Giles was pleased to entertain, Such a Company with grave observations upon my poor Books and discovered, to Trumbull, who had read them, his total Ignorance of them. Trumbull heard him,  he was tired and then Shrewdly asked permission of Mr. Giles to ask him a Simple Question.  ""Pray Mr. Giles have you ever read those Volumes of Mr. Adams?""  Giles taken by Surprize with an unexpected Question, had too much Conscience to prevaricate, blushed, hesitated, Stammered, and at last confessed, No he had not read them, but he had seen Accounts of them in the public Papers and had read Extracts. Then Says Trumbull, I insist upon it, Giles, you have no right to give your Opinion of those Books. The two first Volumes are Facts and Authorities. The last is Reasoning upon them. You can therefore have no Idea of the work without reading all three. Nancy Allen turned round to Mr. Giles  ""I hope Says She Mr. Giles that all your Opinions are not taken up with so much Levity and upon so little foundation!!!"" This story I have from Trumbull himself. I mention Names to you but you will use them with Discretion. These Anecdotes show the real Genius of this enlightened Age. Such is a great part of the Light, which We boast of So much. I expect however to be restored to the good Opinion of my Fellow Citizens in  Virginia. Mr. Vaughan of this Town has  orders from a Correspondent in the ancient Dominion to send him a Dozen setts of ""The Defence."" When the Books shall be read they will vindicate themselves. I wish some one would give some Account of the french Translation and its Notes. An Election is a Lottery and so is hereditary descent. If foul play is used with a Lottery it is fraud. Much of this there has been and more and more their will be.  "

I know not the Price of Stock: but if you can purchase him what he wants at a reasonable rate and can finds means to pay for them I shall be content. But I would employ Some one to purchase them in  Bridgwater or  Abington. Faxon himself is not So Judicious as he ought to be, in Some Things. I have the Same Aversion to the multiplication of Banks and the Same Apprehension of their pernicious tendency as you express: but so many People live upon them, that they will have their Course. We shall soon be perplexed and distressed, in consequence of them. I consider myself already as taxed one half of my Salary and one half of all the Interest of my Money to support Bankers and Bankrupts. In Short Debtors and Men of no Property will find means, in our State of Society, to compel others who have something not only to pay their debts for them but to support them. It falls hardest on Widows orphans, Salary Men, and those who have Money at Interest, we except such of those last as are at Liberty to Speculate. They are able to make what Money they please.   I received yesterday the Votes from  Kentucky. They are Said to be all for Mr. Jefferson. Let Us, my Dear prepare our minds and as well as We can our Circumstances to get out of this miserable Scramble. It gives me pleasure to read that you are making Preparations of Timber for a Corn house, and I hope Shaw will be as attentive as he can through the whole Winter to all my Manufactures of manure, that We may make a good Cornfield in the Summer. I had Yesterday a charming Letter from Charles: according to him, had the Electors of that State been chosen by the People, their Votes would have been very different. The Representation of the People in their present Legislature is very unequal and partial in  of the Anti's, and Clinton; as he has explained very intelligibly and intelligently. Mr. Taylor the new Senator from  Virginia, has made a Motion for opening; our Doors and building a Gallery: but he will not be assisted in his Argument by the late Example of  Virginia, where the Electors of  Richmond opened their Doors, and held debates and  made Phillippicks before  ""The Marseillois"" by which means Six Votes are said to have been converted, either by reasoning or by fear. This Example will not convince the Majority of the Senators of the Necessity, Expediency or propriety of opening their Doors. I have a warm Chamber with a Southern Exposure and have a fire in it day and night. I am warm enough a nights but cannot Sleep since I left you, which keeps me Apprehensive of the Fever and Ague in the Spring. I hope however to escape it. I shall not be able to leave this Place till the fifth or Sixth of March. The Roads will be bad and the Journey by the Stage fatiguing, but I who was born to be a slave must  the End of my Creation.

","My dearest Friend  This day I   yours of the 2d.  I have recd. all the votes from all the States. It is known that  Georgia voted with  North Carolina  Virginia and  New York and  Kentucky voted for  Jefferson. There is no other Newspaper circulated in the back Country of the Southern States than Freneau's National Gazette which  employed with great Industry to poison the Minds of the People. The Foederal Court has again had a Sitting in  Virginia and by reason of Mr. Jays Sickness the great Cause is again continued, which serves to keep up the Rage in that State, and  North Carolina which is its Eccho. If you hire the Man you mention you should know beforehand what kind of skill and Experience he has in farming as well as his Integrity and good disposition. I shall leave it however to you. Twenty Six Pounds are too high. 24 are enough: but if you cannot get one for less We must give 26. I expect  long to hear that Pain is Split and pliced for an Aristocrat: perhaps roasted or broild or fryed. He is too lean to make a good Pye, but he is now  in company with a Number, who are admirably qualified and disposed to feed upon each other. The foolish Vote of the constituting Assembly in  of a Rotation and excluding themselves from being re-elected has cost every Man of Weight and Talents among them his Life or his Country and his fortune. All are murdered banished and confiscated. Danton Robertspiere, Marat &c. are Furies. Dragons Teeth have been sown in  France and come up Monsters. The Army has behaved better and the People seem to be zealous: but if they have not some system by which they can be united, what is to be expected? We have our Robertspierres and Marats whose wills are good to do mischief but the Flesh is weak. They cannot yet persuade the People to follow them. If the national Assembly can Subdue the mutinous Rabble at  Paris as well as Dumourier has driven the Prussians, they may be free and do something, but what I know not.   "

","My dearest Friend  Our good Friend General Lincoln gave me this morning  your  of the 7th  which compensated in Part of my Disappointment by Mondays Post. I sett my heart on one letter a Week and as many more as you please. I cannot say that my desire of Fame increases. It has been Strong in some Parts of my Life but never so strong as my Love of honesty. I never in my Life that I know of sacrificed my Principles or Duty to Popularity, or Reputation. I hope I am now too old ever to do it. But one knows not how  may be borne, till they are made. The Hellbrounds are now in full cry in the Newspapers against the President whom they treat as ill, as ever they did me.  The Same insolent and impudent Irishman who is said to have written so much against me, is now suspected to be writing against him. Both Houses of Congress are making strict Inquisition into the Treasury: with upright and patriotic Views no doubt. Hamilton will find no more mercy than is due from a generous nation to a faithful servant. But I presume his Character will Shone the brighter. However it is still but an Experiment, whether the Ministers of State under an elective Executive will not be overborne, by an elective Legislature, I believe it to be certain that two elective houses of Legislature, or even one, will have it in their Power whenever they shall have it in their will to render any minister of state or even any elective Executive unpopular, though he may be  of the best Talents and most perfect Interests.  I presume that neither of our Houses will be disposed to such Injustice, but the time may come. I am so well satisfied with my present simplicity, that I am determined never to depart from it again so far as I have. My  in future forever shall at all Events be within my income nay within my salary. I will no longer be the miserable Dupe of Vanity. My Style of Life is quite popular. What say you to living with me in Lodgings next Winter? This shall be my Plan if I cannot hire a house for six months only. Your friends who are very numerous enquire tenderly after your health. Benson says he is for making Mrs. Adams Autocratix of the United States. This however must be Secret because it is a sort of Treason.  "

","My dearest Friend  I was not a little , a few days ago at receiving a Letter from Dr. Hutchinson as Secretary to the Philosophical Society in this City certifying my Election as a Member of that Body. This Gentleman you know has been celebrated for his Opposition to my Election as V. P. One of the Society Since told me, that when I was nominated they all rose up and out that I had been a Member these twenty Years. The Truth it seems is that I was elected as long ago as 1779 but the Records for some years preceding and following that time are not now to be found. The Secretary of that day has run  and Fanatic, and knows nothing of the Records if he kept any.  The Sickness of my worthy Brother Cranch, which you mention in your last has given me many a melancholly hour Since I received it. Although the immense Load of Care that has oppressed me for so many Years has rendered me incapable of enjoying his Conversation, as I used to in my Youth, I have ever loved him, and shall never cease to love him. I hope he will recover his health and be preserved to his Friends for many years. My Love to Sister. Duty to my Mother, Love to my Brother and all Friends. Louisa I hope has conquered all her disposition to the Ague and all its crawls and Chills. My Love to her. I am very well accommodated her for myself: but not for Company. I Shall not get away from home before the fifth of March, and then there   will be a long unpleasant Journey before me. But I will make up for all by Enjoyment on the Farm, during the Summer, provided always that I dont get the Ague. That is not quite annihilated in its seeds. I am billous and otherwise reminded to beware of the first hot day.   "
"Philadelphia   January 31. 1793
","My dearest Friend I have, this minute   your favour of the 22d.  The Report of the Presidents Resignation is probably designed to prevent the Rise of the Stocks: but the Insolence which appears every day in Baches and Freneaux Papers, proceeding from the Same Persons who are tired of abusing me, may be carried to a point that he will not bear. He has not been used to such threshing and his skin is thinner than mine. Cit. H.  and Cit. A.  [P. Adams] I presume will grace the Civic Feast. Cit and Citess is to come instead of Gaffer and Gammer Goody and Gooden, Mr. and Mrs., I suppose. Congress I presume will not  after the Second of March. I shall not be able to sett off till the 5th. but I will not wait if I travel but ten miles a day. We Shall see, in a few months, the new French Constitution, which may last Twelve months, but probably not more than Six. Robertspierre and Marat will their Jacobin Supporters I suspect will overthrow the Fabric which Condercet Paine and Brissat will erect. Then We shall see what they in their turn will  produce. Mrs. Washington requests me to present you her very particular regards. Many other Ladies do the same. Citizen Brisler and Citizen V. P., are very happy together. Since they are equal and on a Level it is proper that sometimes one should be named first and sometimes the other. Our Countrymen are about to abandon the good old grave solid manners of Englishmen their Ancestors and adopt all the Apery  and frivolity of the French.    "

","My dearest Friend General Lincoln  out Tomorrow, and I should not dare to let him go without a Love Letter to you. After a November December and January the fairest softest and finest that ever were known in this Place, The Month of February has been ushered in by a considerable Snow: but the Weather is again so fine that the sun will soon restore Us the naked ground: I should like it better in its White Robe of Innocence  the 20th of March. I dined Yesterday at Mr. Daltons. Mrs. Dalton enquires affectionately and sends her regards &c.  night I spent with the Philosophical society. The Meeting was thin but I was not able to perceive any great superiority to our Accademy, except in the President. There are able Men however, and I was agreably entertained. Mr. Jefferson was polite enough to  accompany me: so you see We are still upon Terms. I wish somebody would pay his Debt of Seven Thousand Pounds to  Britain and the Debts of all his Countrymen and then I believe his Passions would subside his Reason return; and the whole Man and his whole State become good Friends of the Union and its Govt. Silence however on this head, or at least great Caution. I hope the  Boston Rejoicings were at the success of the Arms of  France, and not intended as Approbation of all the Jacobinical Councils. I am enough in the Spirit of the Times to be glad the Prussians and Austrians have not succeeded, but not to exult in the Prison or Trial of that King to whom  I am personally under no Obligation, my Country is under the greatest. It is Providentially ordered that I who am the only Man American who was ever Accredited to him, and retired from his Court without his Picture and under his displeasure, should be the only one to bewail his Misfortune. The accursed Politicks of his knavish Favourite have cost him his Crown if not his head,   The Duke de la Rochefoucault too, is cutt to Pieces for his Idolatry. If I had not washed my own hands of all this Blood, by warning them against it, I should feel some of it upon my Soul. Macchiavels Advice to  off a numerous Nobility had more weight than mine to preserve them and Franklins Plagiary Project from Marchement Nedham had more Weight with Fools than all my Proofs strong as holy Writ, the Vengeance of Heaven for their Folly, has been revealed in more Shivering Terms than in any of my numerous Examples.  "
"Philadelphia  Feb. 12. 1793
","My dearest Friend I  Yesterday  your kind favour of the 1st of this Month  and thank your for its agreable Contents. I have now to congratulate you on the arrival of your Son and Daughter and two grandsons in fine health at  New York. They have done wisely to fly from the Evil to come in  Europe; although it is somewhat dubious whether our Fellow Citizens will have the Wisdom to abstain from similar Evils in this Country. My Friend Malesherbes is about to crown the End of his Life, with greater Glory than he gained in his Youth or middle Age,  this was Splendid. Such a Character as that great Magistrate ought to wish to die on So great a Theater, in defence of his Prince and Struggling against the disgrace, which Enthusiasm is about to bring upon the Nation. The Spirit of Ambition and of Conquest  which the French Republick in its Cradle has already discovered has allarmed  England and  Holland. France has been execrated in Europe for their Ambition for Universal Monarchy: but the Passion was imputed to their Kings Henry 4th and Lewis 14th. But the People are already giving unequivocal Proofs of an equal Lust after an Universal . The Passion is and always has been in the People, the Nation, and their Leaders will  [illegible]   ever be infected with it, whether they call them Kings or Presidents or Citizens. I can only sigh, at the Prospect of Calamities opening on the human Race, and pray God to avert them. We have  a deep snow, which I hope will last till I can reach  Quincy in a slay, and there enjoy a felicity which will never be allowed me any where else.  "
"Philadelphia  Feb. 17. 1793
","My dearest Friend We have had such falls of Snow and rain that I Suppose the Mail has been retarded and I have no Letters, and you may be in the same Case. I have written however as regularly as usual. I have no Letters nor Message from our dear Family at  N. York since their Arrival excepting a Line from  the next morning announcing it. Another fortnight; and I shall sett out on my return home. I shall make a short stay at  N. Y. for fear of worse roads as well as from a Zeal to get home, Indeed I have so little affection for that southern State as it has lately become, that the sooner I get thro it the better. I have a great Mind to send home our furniture, My Salary has become ridiculous, sunk more than half in its Value and about to be reduced still lower be another Million of Paper to be emitted by a new Bank of  Pensilvania. Before I was aware I got abominably involved in debt and I shall not easily get out. -- By I will be no longer a Dupe,   The hospitality of  Philadelphia would have kept me, the whole Winter at Dinner with one Family and at Tea and Cards with another: but I have made it a rule to decline all Invitations excepting such as came from Families where I had never dind before, and excepting once with the senators who have families here, once with our Ministers of State and once with foreign Ministers. It has been Employment enough to write Apologies in Answer to invitations. I should have been down with the Ague long before now if I had accepted Invitations to Evening Parties. I never dine out without loosing the next nights Sleep, which shews that there is still a disposition to a fever. I live in terror least the State of  Europe should force the President to Call Congress together in summer. I am not without hopes however that the national Convention of  France will give  England Satisfaction about  Holland, the   Netherlands, and the Seheld, that we may still be blessed with Peace: but if there should be was We shall be intrigued into it, if possible. The Personal hatreds and Party Animosities which prevail here, have left me more in tranquility than any other Person. The Altercations between the humble Friends of the two  Ministers have done no service to the Reputation of either. The S. of the Treasury has suffered as much as the Secretary of State, Ambition is imputed to both, and the Moral Character of both has Suffered in the  [Sensting?] . They have been Lifted by Satan like Wheat and all the Spots that have been discoverd have been circulated far and wide. I am afraid that Hamiltons Schemes-will become unpopular, because the State Legislatures are undermining them and Congress will be obliged either to let them fall in the Publick opinion, or to support them by measures which will be unpopular. Hamilton has been intemperately puffed and this has excited green Eyed Jealousy and haggard Envy, Jays Friends have let Escape feelings of Jealousy as well as Jeffersons. And it is very natural. Poor me who have no Friends to be jealous, I am left out of the question and pray I ever may.  "
" Philadelphia Feb. 27. 1793
","My dearest Friend I am so anxious for your health, Since you  me of the return of your Intermittent, that I shall take the Stage on Monday for  N.  [New] York, but whether I shall go by the Packet to  Providence, or continue in the Stage to  Boston, I know not. This will depend upon the Wind and other Circumstances to be learn'd at  N.  [New] York. C. Smith is here in good health. He is returned from  France and  England, almost a Revolutionist, if not quite. The Fermentation in  Europe distresses me, least it should take a turn which may involve Us in many difficulties. Our Neutrality will be a very delicate Thing to maintain: and I am not without Apprehensions that Congress or at least the Senate may be called together in the summer if not earlier. However We must be prepared as well as We can for Events.  The Attorney General, in opening the information to the Jury, at the Tryal of Mr. Paine, was pleased to quote large Passages from Publicola, with Some handsome Compliments: So that Publicola is become a Law Authority. Mr. Erskine in his Answer cryed, Well, let others do like Publicola. Answer the Book not prosecute the Author. I am weary of reading Newspapers. The Times are so full of Events, the whole Drama of the World is such a Tragedy that I am weary of the Spectacle. Oh my Sweet little farm, what would I  give to enjoy thee without interruption? But I see no end to my Servitude, however the nations of  Europe and even of  Africa may recover their Liberty. Hamilton has been Sufficiently fatigued with demands for Statements and Information. I hope his health will hold out, and his Character be Supported: but We have broad hints of what  may be expected by Executive officers, who depend upon an Elective head, from Elective Legislatures. Ambitious Members of a Legislature will too easily run down the Popularity of Ministers of State, or I am egregiously mistaken. But Ca ira. France will Soon  Us Examples enough of Ministers falling before ambitious Legislatures, if she has not exhibited enough already. Calonne Neckar, Montmorin and 20 others, where are they?  "
"Philadelphia  March 2. 1793
","My dear Your Letter from your Sick Chamber if not from your Sick bed, has made me so uneasy that I must get away as soon as possible. Monday Morning at Six, I am to  off in the Stage, but how many days it will take to get home will depend on the Roads, and or the Winds. I dont believe Nabby will go with me. Her Adventurer of an Husband is so proud of his Wealth that he would not let her go I suppose without a Coach and four, and such Monarchical Trumpery I will in future have nothing to do with. I will never travel but by the Stage nor live at the Seat of Government but at Lodgings, while they give me so despleable an Allowance. Shiver my Jibb and start my Planks if I do. I will Stay but one night at  New York.  Smith says that my Books are upon the Table of every Member of the Committee for framing a Constitution of Government for  France except Tom Paine, and he is so conceited as to disdain to have any Thing to do with Books. Although I abused Smith, a little above he is very clever and : but I have been obliged to caution him against his disposition to boasting. Tell not of your Prosperity because it will make two Men mad to one glad; nor of your Adversity for it will make two Men sad glad to one glad Sad. He boasts too much of having made his fortune, and placed himself at his ease; above all favours of Government. This is a weakness, and betrays too little knowledge of the World: too little Penetration; too little discretion.  I wish however that my Boys had a little more of his Activity. I must soon treat them as The Pidgeons treat their Squabs -- push them off the Limb and make them put out their Wings or fall. Young Pidgeons will never fly till this is done. Smith has acquired the Confidence of the French Ministry and the better sort of the Members of the national Convention: but the Executive is too changeable in that Country to be depended on, without the Utmost caution.

"Hartford  Nov. 24. 1793
","My dearest Friend We have had an  Journey to this Town, have been to Meeting all Day and heard two excellent Discourses from Mr. Strong: We are to drink Tea at Col. Wadsworths, Trumbul and his Lady are at  New Haven, At four or five O Clock in the Morning We proceed. The Weather to day is soft and fine, tho We had last night a violent Wind and Rain, Accounts from  Philadelphia are unanimous in favour of the Healthiness of the City: Yet I think with Col. Wadsworth that a Pause at  Trenton to consider and inquire will not be much amiss. The  Virginia Assembly have taken up the Presidents Proclamation and seventy Odd against forty Odd, voted it right. But when the Minority found themselves cast  they prevailed with the Majority to vote that they had nothing to do with it. Enough however was done to convince Us that We shall not be, wholly under the Directions of a foreign Minister. Thatcher has taken for his Vade meum Fontenelles History of Oracles. I mentioned to him Farmer upon Devils: a Title that charmed him so much that he is determined to send for Farmers Works. Mr. Storer requests that you would let his Family know We are thus far safe. Brisler does the same.    "

I go on towards  Philadelphia .   "
"Philadelphia  Decr. 1. 1793
","My dearest Friend We may ever remember  The thirtieth of November because it was the Day on which We were absolved from Infamy; in 1782 and because it was the Day on which I entered this City in 1793. Finding by all Accounts that the Pestilence was no more to be heard of, and that Mr. Otis had returned to his House, I drove directly to Market Street and took Possession of my old Chamber and bed. The principal Families have returned, the President is here, Several Members of Congress are arrived and Business is going on with some Spirit. The greatest Mortality appears to have been in bad Houses and among loose Women and their gallants among the Sailors and low foreigners. Some Persons of Note have fallen. Dr. Hutchinson is thought to have been the Victim of his own french Zeal, by  admitting infected Persons and goods from French Vessells from the French  West Indies Islands. If, however the Contagion was imported the State of the Air and of the Blood, which was prepared to catch like tinder was not imported. Mr. Otis has written for his Family. Our son  has been once in Town but has returned to  Woodbury. Mr. Anthony came in last Evening and gave me an Account of his Enquiries, the Result of all is that the Destroying Angel has put up his sword, and Said it is enough. It will be enough I hope to convince  Philadelphia that all has not been well. Moral and religious Reflections I shall leave to their own Thoughts: but The Cleanness of the Streets I shall preach in Season and out of Season.  My Duty and Love where due.   "
"Philadelphia  Decr. 5. 1793
","My dearest Friend I wrote you from  Hartford,  New York and once from  Philadelphia: but have not yet had the Pleasure of a Letter from you Since I left home. The Night before last We had a deep Snow, which will probably extinguish all remaining Apprehensions of Infection. We hear of no Sickness and all Seem at their Ease and without fear. The Presidents  will Shew you an Abundance of Serious Business which We have before Us: Mr. Jefferson called on me last night and informed me, that to day We should have the whole Budget of Foreign Affairs British as well as French. He Seems as little Satisfied with the Conduct of the French Minister as any one.  Spent the last Evening with me. He has had an Opportunity of Seeing the Courts, Judges Lawyers &c. of  New Jersey, in the Course of the last fall, and has I hope employed his time to Advantage. This Day he is to be examined and this Week, Sworn in. May a Blessing Attend him.  Although I have Attended and shall Attend my Duty punctually in Senate, I shall not run about upon Visits without caution: Yet I believe there is little or no danger. The Viscount Noailles called on me, and I  after all his Connections in a Family which I knew to be once in great Power Wealth and Splendor. He Seems to despair of Liberty in  France and has lost apparently all hopes of ever living in  France. He was very critical in his inquiries concerning the Letters which were printed as mine in  England. I told him candidly that I did not write them and as frankly in confidence who did. He Says they made a great Impression upon the People of  England. That he heard Mr. Windham and Mr. Fox Speak of them as the best Thing that had been written, and as one of the best Pieces both of Reasoning and Style they had ever read. The Marquis he Says is living but injured in his health. Your old Friend the Marchioness still lives in  France in Obscurity in the Country. He thinks that a Constitution like that of  England would not last three days in  France, and that Monarchy will not be restored in a dozen Years if ever. The Partitioning and arbitrary Spirit of the combined Powers will contribute more than  towards Uniting the French under their old Government. Frenchmen cannot bear the Partition of their Country: and rather than see it divided among their neighbours they will unite in something or other. It will require all the Address, all the Temper, and all the Firmness of Congress and the States, to keep this People out of the War: or rather to avoid a Declaration of War against Us, from some mischievous Power or other. It is but little that I can do, either by the Functions which the Constitution has entrusted to me, or by my personal Influence. But that little shall be industriously employed  it is put beyond a doubt that it will be fruitless, and then I shall be as ready to meet unavoidable Calamities as any other Citizen.    "
"Philadelphia  Decr. 12. 1793
","My dearest Friend This Day having been devoted to Thanksgiving by the Governor of  Pensilvania, Congress have adjourned to . We have had a great Snow and afterwards a great Rain but not enough to carry off all the Snow. The Weather therefore is still cool, tho fair and pleasant. All Apprehension of the Fever seems entirely departed, a Circumstance the more comfortable to me, as, having been among a few of the Earliest who came into Town, if any Thing unfortunate had followed I might have been reproached for setting a procipitate Example. Our Son  was examined approved and sworn the last Week; so that We have three Lawyers upon the Theatre of Action. May they be ornaments to their Country and Blessings to the World. Congress has a great Task and a very unpleasant one before them. With Indians and Algerines for open  and so many other Nations for suspicious Friends, besides so many Appearances of ill Will among our own Citizens, who ever Envied a seat in that Body I believe the Members have no great reason to be delighted with theirs. My own is a situation, of  such compleat Insignificance, that I have scarcely the Power to do good or Evil: Yet it is the Station the most proper for me, as my Eyes and hands and Nerves are almost worn out. The two Houses have been tolerably unanimous in giving to the Presidents System a kind of rapid Approbation: but what will be the Result of the Negotiations with  France and  England I know not.  has regained his Reputation by the Part he has taken, and his Compositions are much applauded by his able Friends and assented to by others. The first deputations of the Algerines are so well calculated to prevent Emigration to this Country  England  Scotland and  Ireland, that People are ready enough to impute their Truce with  Portugal and  Holland to British Interference Our Trade is like to suffer by the Arbitrary Decrees of  England  Spain and  France as well as by the ferocious Pyracy of  Affrica. This Winter will  Us the Temper of  England as well as  France. Americans cannot see with Pleasure the French Islands fall into English hands, nor will even French Emigrants be gratified with the Partition of their Country But Foresight is impossible in such a Chaos.

","My dearest Friend This morning I received, with high Pleasure  your  of the 28th, of November , which as it is the first News I have had from you since I left you has relieved my mind from some part of its Anxiety on Account of your health. I Yesterday attended Dr. Greens Sermon on the Thanksgiving, who Sung of Judgment as well as Mercy and told his Hearers of all their faults. He went through the De  alogue and enumerated the Transgressions of every Article of it, in this City. I write nothing of Public Affairs, because the Public Papers will give you full Information. The Result of the whole is that a Combination of barbarous Nations, Spaniards French English Algerines and Indians, will trouble Us for some  time, I Suppose We shall have Motions for a Navy as well as Presents, to assist negotiations with Algerines. A great Indignation has been excited at  New York by a Libel on the President, which I have not Seen as it is Suppressed at present as much as possible. Greanleaf has published an Apology, at least as  as it is modest. M. Genet has arrived last night in this City: he was escorted in great Pomp through the Streets of  New York to the Ferry; but by his own Countrymen only. I agreed with Samil to give him Three Shillings and Six Pence a load for Seaweed, I should be glad to get as much as possible into the Yard, I know very well you will do what the Time will permit, in facilitating the Operations of the next Year. Brisler is well, "
"Philadelphia  Decr. 15. 1793
","My dearest Friend Having taken a cold which makes it inconveinent to go out this morning I cannot employ myself more  than by writing to you The President and Mrs. Washington enquire after you very respectfully every time I see them. Mrs. Washington enquires after all of Us and particularly Miss Louisa. She wishes, with an Emphesis and I dare say very sincerely, that I had brought you along with me. Mr. Dandridge acts at present as The Presidents Secretary and I dont find that he has any other Secretary or Aid de Camp at all. Miss Nelly went over into  Maryland in the Course of the Summer and there got the Ague and Fever. The poor girl lookd pale and thin, in Consequence of it but will soon get the better of it. Brisler has engaged some Rye Flour for you, but when you will receive it, I know not. Cheesman is not yet Arrived. Yesterday was brought me an Account of which I had not the least suspicion for above an hundred dollars, from Bringhurst. Will it not be adviseable to sell the Cochee? and the Chariot,? and buy a new Chariot? Perhaps some Coachmaker in  Boston would exchange. We shall have little Use for the Cochee, and have no Room at present to dispose of the Coach. I only mention this for consideration.  Furniture and Carriages have made Mischief enough for Us. Rocks are much better, at least they do less harm. I went to see Mrs. Wilson, but she was gone out. The Judge was at home, and is very young notwithstanding his Spectacles and white Hair. Mrs. Hammon looks portly enough for a Lady who has been the Wife of an Ambassador half a Year and more. I told you in a former Letter that  was examined approved and sworn. For want of a virtuous Magistracy or a virtous Attorney General Pro Tempore, to prosecute convict and punish disordorly Houses at  New York, the  Mobility took the Guardianship of the public morals into their own hands and pulled down Seven or eight houses, turning with exemplary Inhumanity many Ladies into the cold Air and open Street The public was irritated by two or three Charges of Rapes, and the Lawyers treated the Subject with too much Levity, treated virtuous creditable Women with too much indifference and Mother Cary the old Meldam Beldam with to much respect. This is what I hear. I am Sorry that Mobs should have a plausible Excuse for Setting up for reformes. But I never Could feel an intollerable Indignation against the Riots called Skimmington Ridings when they really were excited by gross Offences against Morals.  "
"Philadelphia  Decr. 19 1793
","My dearest Friend Mrs. Otis arrived with her little Rosignol, in good health and Spirits the night before last, and brought me your  of Decr. 7. Why am not I so fortunate as to be able to receive my best Friend, and to Spend my Days with her whose Society is the principal delight of my Life. If I could make Twelve Thousand dollars at a Bargain and Several of such Bargains in a Year: but silence, So it is ordained and We must not complain. If a suitable Season should occur for ploughing, our Men may plough, if not may leave it till Spring. I like your Plan very well to Stock our Place with young Cattle, and to apply to Shaw if Humphreys and Porter declining, to take more of the Dairy in the other. I am pleased with Dr Tuft's Plan. Citizen Genet made me a Visit Yesterday while I was in Senate and left his Card I shall leave mine at his hotel Tomorrow: as Several of the Senators have already hastened to return their Visits: but we shall be in an Awkward situation with this Minister. I write you little concerning public affairs, because you will have  in Print. How a Government can go on, publishing all their Negotiations   with foreign Nations I know not. To me it appears as dangerous and pernicious as it is novel: but upon this occasion it could not perhaps have been avoided. You know where I think was the Error in the first Concoction. But such Errors are unavoidable where the People in Crowds out of Doors undertake to receive Ambassadors, and to dictate to their Supream Executive. I know not how it is: but in proportion as dangers threaten the Public, I grow calm. I am very apprehensive that a desperate Antifederal Party, will provoke all  Europe by their insolence. But my Country has in its Wisdom contrived for me, the most insignificant Office that ever the Invention of Man contrived or his Imagination conceived: and as I can do neither good nor Evil, I must be born away by Others and meet the common Fate.  The President has considered the Conduct of Genet, very nearly in the same light with Columbus and has given him a Bolt of Thunder. We shall see how this is supported by the two Houses. There are, who gnash their Teeth with rage which they dare not own as yet. We shall soon see, whether We have any Government or not in this Country. If the President has made any Mistake at all, it is by too much Partiality for the French Republicans and in not preserving a Neutrality between the Parties in France as well as among the Belligerent Powers: But although   he stands at present as high in the Admiration and Confidence of the people as ever he did, I expect he will find any bitter and desparate Enemies arise in Consequence of his Just Judgment against Genet. Besides that a Party Spirit will convert White into black and Right into Wrong, We have I fear very corrupt Individuals in this Country, independent of the common Spirit of Party. The common Movements of Ambition every day disclose to me Views and hopes and Designs that are very diverting. But these I will not commit to Paper. They make sometimes a very pretty Farce, for Amusement, after the great Tragedy or Comedy is over What I write to you must be in Sacred Confidence and strict discretion. Mrs. Washington prays me, every time I see her to remember her to you very affectionately.   "
"Philadelphia  Decr. 20 1793
","My dearest Friend This Morning I returned Mr. Genets Visit. The conversation was confined to some Inquiries I made Concerning his Mother, and Sisters with whom I was Acquainted at  Versailles in 1778, 1779, and 1780, and some little discussion about the form of the new Constitution: but not one Word or hint or Allusion concerning himself his Conduct, or the Conduct of our Government or People towards him. I perceive some Traits or his  which I knew in 1779. He appears a Youth totally destitute of all experiences in popular Government popular Assemblies or Conventions of any kind: very little  to reflect on his own or his fellow Creatures hearts wholly ignorant of the Law of Nature and Nations, the civil Law, and even of the Dispatches at Ancient Ambassadors with which his own Nations and Language abound. A declamatory Style a flitting fluttering Imagination, an Ardour in his Temper, and a civil Deportment are all the Accomplishments or Qualifications I can find in him, for his Place.  The Printer in  Boston cannot Afford Room for  Columbus, though he has Space enough for the most miserable Trash. The Writer had better print such Things in a Pamphlet - in that way a Printer might make Money. He cannot be too cautious to avoid all expressions, which may be thought inconsistent with the Character of a Gentleman. I thank him for his masterly  of the Writers on the Law of Nations and for laying before the Public such Passages as are extreamly to the Purpose. Your Children must conduct the Affairs of this Country, or they will be  managed, for I declare I know of nobody but them or some of them rising up who are  [illegible]   qualified for it. If they suffer as much in the service, and got a little either of honour Profit or Pleasure by it as their Father has done, they will deserve to be pitied rather than envied.  and Mr. Jefferson have handled Genet, as freely as Columbus. How Jefferson can feel I know not. There are Passages in Genets Letters which imply that Jefferson himself contributed very much to lead him into the snare. "
"Philadelphia  Decr 22 1793
","My dearest Friend I went this morning to Dr. Greens and this afternoon to  St. Pauls where I heard Dr. Magaw: but I am not sure it is prudent to go to Church or to Meeting for if there is danger and can be infection any there it is as likely to be in these Assemblies as  in any Place. All the world however says and believes there is no danger. Our Son  opened at the Bar, on Freyday and acquitted himself to his own Satisfaction at least, and that is a great Point. His cause was a Prosecution of a disorderly house and consequently his Audience was crowded. Two of your Sons are thus engaged in the great Work of Reformation and I wish them success. Mr. Ingersol thinks, that as Charles is not necessitated to push into the Country for an immediate subsistance, he had better remain in the City where there is the greatest Quantity and Variety of profitable Business. But advises  me to let him ride the Circuits in the Summer, to see the Country and the People as well as practice. This Plan upon the whole I approve, among many others for this decisive one, that he will avoid the danger if there should be any in the Summer Months. I cannot write you upon public Affairs. I should write in Shackles. There will be many weak Propositions no doubt. It is even possible there may be some wicked ones: None I hope stark mad. The Antifederal Party by their ox feasts and their civic feasts, their king killing Toasts, their perpetual insolence and Billings gate against all the Bations and Governments of  Europe their everlasting brutal Cry of Tyrants, Despots, Combinations against Liberty &c &c &c have probably irritated, offended and provoked all the Crowned Heads of  Europe at least: and a little more of this Indelicacy and Indecency may involve Us in a War with all the World. On the other hand It is possible the French Republicans may be angry with Us for preventing their Minister from involving Us in War and Anarchy. The State is in critical Circumstances, and have been brought into them by the Heat and Impatience of the People. If nothing will bring them to consideration, I fear they will suffer  Severely for their Rashness. The Friends of the Government have been as blind as its Ennemies in giving Way to the Torrent. Their great Error was in suffering Publicola to be overborn and Paines Yellow Fever to be Spread and propagated and applauded, as if, instead of a Distemper, a putrid, malignant mortal fatal Epidemic, it had been a Sulubrious shower of Blessings from on high. It is reported this Luminary is coming to America I had rather, two more Genets should arrive. Mrs. Dalton and too many others to be named, desire their respects to you. My office renders me so  insignificant that all Parties can afford to treat me with a decent respect which accordingly they do, as far as I observe, or hear or suspect. They all know that I can do them neither much good nor much harm. My Health has been pretty well, excepting a Cold which I regularly have upon entering this City two or three Weeks, every Year. I am afraid We shall have a long Session. But I hope We shall rise in April. My duty to my Mother and Love where due  "

","My dearest Friend Yours of December 14th.  was Just now brought to me. I wrote you from  Hartford, and from  New York, and on the 30th. of November from  Philadelphia and almost  Since, certainly once or twice every Week. I thank your Ladyship for your kind Attention to the little concerns of my Hobby Horse, and am perfectly satisfied with your Judgment and Care. I have too many Motives to  my whole Attention to the Public, to find many Moments to think of my farm but when your letters remind me of it, they give no great Pleasure. You will e'er this day have been furnish'd with enough to think on. Congress are, in a long pause, employed in reading the Communications from the president and Executive Department which are extremely voluminous. The Advocates for Peace I hope will prevail and the Students in War be disappointed We shall now See, whether there will be a Party formally combind against their Country and the President, in favour of the intemperate Republicans of  France, or not. The Popularity of our President never appeared to be more useful, more important or more decisive than at this time. The Antifederalists must now destroy that Popularity, and remove him from his office, or they cannot carry their Points at least so many of them as they aim at. Our Madmen however continue their Frolicks, and Still endevour to provoke all  Europe against their Country, by their Toasts.  If the Trespasses upon Ruggles's Lot, let Mr. Adams Sue him immediately in my Name as soon as he can be discovered, and Let him sue Wilson too, if he can find Proof I will make Examples of some of them. I have read Columbus, and although it may be exposed to the Ridicule of employing a Beetle to kill a fly; it is masterly Course of Reasoning, in a Strain of Eloquence, which no other man in this Country that I know of is equal to. In this Place I hear nothing Said of it. All is Silence here. The Printers are both dastardly ignorant and Stupid, otherwise they would have reprinted this Work. Popularity is now in a great Puzzle. It must either be Whist or Change its tone, or Attack the President. It is afraid to do either of the last, as yet. Mrs. Washington always desires me to present her Regards to you.  "
"Philadelphia.  Decr. 26. 1793
","My dearest Friend I have enough to do to write Apologies in Answer to Invitations to dinner and to Tea Parties: but I have long since taken the Resolution that I will not again  myself and all my time in a wild vagary of Dissipation. As it is not in my Power to live on equal terms with the Families and Personages who exhibit so much real Hospitality in this City, I would not lay myself under obligations to that which I could not repay. But besides this I have other Motives. I have Occasion for some time to write Letters to my friends, and for more, that I may read something, and not be wholly ignorant of what is passing in the litterary world. There is more pleasure and Advantage to me, in this than is to be found in Parties at dinner or at Tea. Columbus is republishing in  New York, in a public Paper of whose Title I am ignorant, whose Editor is Mr. Noah Webster who is lately removed from  Hartford to that City and is said to conduct his Gazette with Judgment and Spirit upon good Principles. He has given a conspicuous Place and a large handsome  Type, as I am told to the Speculation of the Bostonian. Here they are unknown,  except to two or three but I have heard they are to appear A Printer having heard Mr. Ames Say they were a very compleat Thing and that there was but one Man in  Boston that he knew of who could write them. Our Friend Mr. Cabot has bought a Farm in  Brokelyne, adjoining to that of my Grandfathers, where he is to build an House next Summer. He delights in nothing more than in talking of it. The Searchers of Secret motives in the heart have their Conjectures that this Country Seat in the Vicinity of  Boston was Purchased with the same Views which some ascribed to Mr. Gerry in purchasing his  at  Cambridge and to Gen Warren in his allighting on  Milton Hill. Whether these Shrewd Conjectures are right or not, I own I wish the State may never have worse Governor, than Gerry or Cabot, and I once thought the same of the other. I am told  is to resign tomorrow. I have so long been in the habit of thinking well of his Abilities and general good dispositions, that I cannot but feel some regret at this Event: but his want of Candour, his obstinate Prejudices both of Aversion and Attachment his real Partiality in Spite of all his Pretensions and his low notions about many things have so nearly reconciled me to it, that I will not weep.  Whether he will be chosen Governor of  Virginia, or whether he is to go to  France, in Place of Mr. Morris I know not. But this I know that is he is neglected at  Monticello he will soon see a Spectre like the disgraced Statesman in Gill Blass, and not long afterwards will die, for instead of being the ardent pursuer of Science that some think him, I know he is indolent, and his soul is prisoned with Ambition. Perhaps the Plan is to retire, till his Reputation magnifies enough to force him into the Chair in Case. So be it, if it is thus ordained. I like the Precedent very well because I expect I shall have Occasion to follow it. I have been thirty years planning and preparing an Assylum for myself and a most admirable one it is, for it is so entirely out of order, that I might busy myself, to the End of my Life, in making Improvements. So that God willing I hope to conquer the fowl Fiend while whenever I shall be obliged or inclined to retire. But of this prattle, (entre nous) enough.   "

","My dearest Friend This morning I received  your  of the 20th . The House I am in was aired and smoked with Tar and Powder and the Vault. Slaked with Lime &c before I came in. I hope with you that Congress will not remain here late in the Spring: but the Extent of Business before Us seems to be immense. Perhaps the less We do the better. Something however must be done. When Russell said  ""there is but one Man capable of Writing Columbus"" he said what I have thought all along. The Persons I converse with are too wise to give any Opinions or say  about such Writings. Most are too wise to read them. I wish Columbus may not be inflated with Vanity, and too much emboldened.festine lente He will have more Influence in his Closet, than upon the Stage. I  with you and Lousia. My own health has been better for my Journey: but I have a great Cold every Year, before I have been a fortnight in the City and you know it lasts Six Weeks. I never find any Benefit from any thing I do for it, so I leave it to take its Couse Course. But as Mr. Izard and his wife say  ""We are grown too old to live separate."" Mr. Izard is here keeping Batchelors Hall. She at  New York with Mrs. Marigold. It is very hard upon me in very old Age to be obliged to live with my Family, after having been a Slave for thirty years. Oh Columbus, Columbus you know not what you are About. Mrs. Washington is here and never fails to make the kindest Inquiries and to send the most cordial Regards. I this day recieved a Visit from Mr. Joseph Priestley the oldest son of Dr. Priestley, with a Letter from his Father. The Letter with a Card was left when I was in the Senate: as soon as I came home and found the Letter, I returned the Visit, and found Mr. Joseph Priestly with his Wife and his youngest Brother, with another Englishman whose name is Colman I believe. I revere the Dr. and his Sons are likely Men: but they will do no good in  America,  they are undeceived. They are blinded by Ignorance or Error: blinded beyond the most stupid and besotted of our American Jacobins, entre nous. They are young however and will be corrected by Experience. I like the Drs. Plan very well. I can sent You, what you may want I hope. There cannot be too much Seaweed, provided the Loads are heavy enough. I hope The Bedding of the Animals is changed often. We have  Weather here. We hear nothing of Cheesman. Mrs. Dalton Mrs. Otis hear nothing of their adventures which were on board Phillips. There has been terrible Gales at Sea and many Small Craft lost. I do not yet despair of Cheesman, but We are in Trouble on his Account. We shall soon see The Lt. Governors Speech to the General Court. Some curious  if not Jesuitical Subtilties I warrant you: The Dotage of a Man who was never equal to the Station he now holds may demand some Excuses. But no Man in that Chair will be independant.Independance is not compatible with popular Elections I fear. These are Truths that even I am not independant enough to say to every Body. But although The Popular Voice will overcome every Man, in some degree, I hope We shall be able to Steer the Vessell clear of the Rocks and Sands. God knows!   "

","My dearest Friend I have taken a Sheet of Paper, only to wish you an happy new Year and many happy repetitions of this . I received yesterday a Letter and  of his Liberty Papers and Pamphlets from Mr. B Hollis dated 18. Feb. 1793. Where it has been I cannot guess. He sends his best wishes to you and hopes you have recovered your health and spirits. I suppose Columbus has now done with G.-- I read his Number 5. yesterday. The Printers are all Poltroons or they would insert the whole in all their Papers; They are afraid of an Antifederal Party and of a French Party now associated in one, and very powerful with many Readers of newspapers. If Genet has by his Conduct made many of them afraid to avow their Attachment to him, they still avoid giving him  and will come out in his vindication whenever they think they may with Safety. Cheesman is not arrived and Brisler is put to more Inconvenience than I am for want of our Trunk. It is feared he is lost, but I still hope he will be heard of, after some time. My Duty Love and Compliments where proper.  "

","My dearest Friend The Door Keeper has just brought me  your kind Letter of  28 . Freneau's Paper is discontinued and Fenno's is become a daily advertising Paper and has not yet been worth sending you. The State Papers will be reprinted in Rusells Paper which you have and there has been nothing else worth reading. I send you the Negotiations with Genet, . The Algerines will cost this country very dear. We may curse them, as much as We please and fight them as long as We will and after all We must advance them the Cash. This has been long my Opinion but I could not be believed. We may rave against the English and Spaniards: but We had better learn better manners than wantonly to insult and provoke Nations who have Power to hurt Us. Genet has not appeared at the Levee: but he made me a Visit in Ceremony, soon after he came to Town, which I returned the second day afterwards.  Jefferson went off Yesterday, and a good riddance of bad ware. I hope his Temper will be more cool and his Principles more reasonable in Retirement than they have been in office. I am almost tempted to wish he may be chosen Vice President at the next Election for there he could do neither good nor harm if he could do no good, he could do no harm. He has Talents I know, and Integrity I believe: but his mind is now poisoned with Passion Prejudice and Faction. You have drawn an affecting Picture of Distress in the Family of Dr. Rhoads. How it is possible for People to marry and proceed to getting a Brood of Children without any means of support, I know not. A more imprudent Enterprize never was undertaken than the Removal of that Family to  Braintree, and after they came there, they never took a Step, which common Sense would have dictated to get into Business. I hope however you will contribute as much as you can to alleviate her Distress. My imagination has often painted to me exactly such a Picture in a Case of our silly Charles, who was once in a fair Way to have raised as happy a family but who I hope is grown wiser. He You ought to have written the history of Mrs. Rhoads and her Children to him.

 We have had a cold day or two: but the Weather is now as beautiful as it was last winter. I think it is not quite so warm and therefore I hope will not lay a foundation for another summer like the last. We have no News of Cheesman. Brisler wants his Cloaths more than I do, mine. Columbus has been reprinted in several Papers in  New York but not yet in this City. Parties run high in  South Carolina. A Mr. S. Drayton has published a curious Narration of his own Sufferings but has not even denied the Fact of which he was charged. My New Mans Address has it The People in general are wise, upright, firm and steady: But There are little groups of Wrongheads in every principal Town.  "
"Philadelphia  Jan. 9. 1794
","My dearest Friend The Anxiety you express (in your kind Letter of  31  which I received this morning) for your Country and the Happiness of your Children is very amiable. The Prospects of this Country are gloomy, but the Situation of all  Europe is calamitous beyond all former Examples. At what time and in what manner and by what means, the Disasters which are come and seem to be coming on Mankind may be Averted I know not. Our own People have been imprudent, as I think and are now smarting under the Efforts of their Indiscretion. But this instead of a Consolation is an aggravation of our Misfortune. Mr. Genet has been abusive on the President and all his Ministers beyond all measures of decency, or Obligations of Truth, and in other respects not yet publickly investigated, has been such as to make it difficult to know what to do with him. But I cannot explain myself fully: you must wait for time to bring forth Events and Ecclaircissments. I have read all the Numbers of Columbus, and  although I am pleased with the style and Arrangement, the extent of Learning and force of Reason, I thought in some Places a little more less Indignation, might have been more becoming. Whether the President has read them I know not. I have been afraid to ask questions or make Observations to any body lest I should be thought to be too much interested. There are Quantum Meruits in a Lawyers Office, but none in a printing office for an honest Man, any more than in a senate.  inclosed to his Brother at  Boston a Check on the Bank for 400 Dollars to pay Gen. L. -- but has received no Acknowledgement of it. I must send you some Money. You must have hay, and all other Necessaries. No News of Cheesman. Mrs. Washington always  affectionately after your health, and I never forget to present your Respects. The News of this Evening is, that the Queen of France is no more. When will Savages be satiated with Blood? No Prospect of Peace, in  Europe, and therefore none of internal Harmony in  America. We cannot well be in a more  Situation than We are with all  Europe, with all Indians and all Barbary Rovers. Nearly one half the Continent is in constant opposition to the other, and the Presidents Situation which is highly responsible is very distressing. He made me a very friendly Visit Yesterday which I returned  and had two hours Conversation with him alone in his Cabinet. The Conversation which was extremely interesting and equally affectionate, I cannot explain even by a hint. But his earnest desire to do, right, and his close Application to discover it, his deliberate and comprehensive View of our affairs with all the World, appeared in a very amiable and respectable Light. The Antifederalists and the frenchified Zealots have nothing now to do, that I can conceive of but to ruin his character destroy his Peace, and injure his health. He supports all the Attacks with greatness and his health appears to be very good. The Jacobins would make a Sortee upon him in in all the force they could mustar, if they dared. I run on and say nothing so I will conclude  "

","My dearest Friend Knowing your Taste for political Speculations I send you a couple of Pamphlets for your Amusement. The American Production is said to have been written by a Senator from  Virginia Mr. Taylor, I know not how truly. It is like his Style Spirit Opinions and Sentiments. There is too much foundation for some of his Observations: But although he  has Told some Truth he has not told the whole Truth and he has told something that is not Truth. One Bank of the  United States, with its Branches strictly limited in its operations would be Useful: But the State Legislatures have multiplied Banks to such a Degree that one knows not how far the Evil has already gone nor where it will Stop. The Pamphlet however is an ill-natured wrong-headed and low-lived Thing.  "

","My dearest Friend I had Yesterday the Pleasure of  yours of January 5 . I will send, to Mr. Adams a Check upon the Branch Bank for two hundred Dollars as soon as I can get  to transact the Business for me. I am glad to find that you have had Applications for the Farms I wish you to hear that you had  their Characters and Circumstances. We are all of are here, very much concerned for Cheesman. He has not been heard of.  I have not seen Americus nor Barnevelt. But in the former the latter had to deal with a Man who is the least of a Gentleman of  in  Boston. I hope the latter will not forget that he is one.  Our Son will find the Envy of his Friends, the bitterest Drop in the Cup of Life. He must have a Care however not to give them Advantages by  indiscreet Exultations, nor by any unmanly humiliations. Let him take no improper Notice of what he must see and feel. I could entertain even you with a long History of my own Sufferings in this Way.  I have read of a People in Antiquity called the Ephesini who passed a fundamental Law in these Words  ""Let none of Our Citizens excell others in merit, if he does let him live else where and with others."" For this horrible decree Heraclitus pronounced them all worthy of dying in the prime of Life. These are Vices to which Democratical Governments are more peculiarly liable than any others. Our Son must expect to smart under them all his Life.  "

","My dearest Friend I send you, at present the Negotiations with Mr. Hammond as I sent you before those with Mr. Genet. I wish I could send you ""The Example of  France a Warning to  Britain"" a Pamphlet of Arthur Young the Secretary of Sir John Sinclairs Agricultural Society: but it is borrowed and must be returned. He is more Burkish than Burke I think.  Congress will do little this session I believe and perhaps the less the better.  Americanus has received just such a Flagellation as he has deserved these twenty Years. His Blunders, his Ignorance his  his Duplicity and Insincerity has been detected and exposed. And if The Block head had always been treated with the same Freedom and Spirit he would have been held in total Contempt before this day and would have been quite harmless. I have however that Barnevelt will not make himself cheap by meddling much with such Fools and Knaves. Nee Deus intersit nisi dignus, Vendice nodus.  Thomas has sent to his Brother, two hundred dollars for you in a Check on some bank. We have an open Winter, much too mild to clear the Atmosphere of all its . It is said that a dry Fall is commonly followed by an open Winter. When the large Tracts and great Lakes in the North West are not Wet and full of Water in the Fall before Winter setts in, there is seldom much snow or great Cold in the Course of it. I presumd the Ice is not sufficient any more than the Snow for our Wall Operations but your our Wood may be brought home for the whole summer I should supppose. There is a quantity of manure throwd out of the Ditches at the Coves which I should wish carted or sledded into the yard if it can be conveniently: but I would not  [illegible]  plan too much Work.

","My dearest Friend We go slowly forward so slowly as to produce no Results, which is a better course than to run rapidly in a Career of Mischief. I go to Senate every day, read the Newspapers before I go and the Public Papers afterwards, see a few Friends once a Week, go to Church on Sundays; write now and then a Line to you and to : and oftener to Charles than to his Brothers to see if I can fix his Attention and excite his Ambition in which design I flatter myself I shall have Success.  John may pursue his Studies and Practice with confidence as well as Patience. His Talents, his Virtues his Studies and his Writings are not unknown, nor will they go without their Recompence, if Trouble is a Recompence for Trouble, If the People neglect him the Government will not: of the Government neglect him the People will not, as least very long. Thomas is reading for Clarendon, in order to form a Judgment of the Duration of the French Republick; and all other such Democratical Republicks which may arise in the great Maritime and to commercial, Avaricious and corrupted Nations of  Europe.  Cheesman I hear is returned to  Boston. Our Trunk had better be taken out. Thomas's Books and Boots should be sent here but the rest may be carried to  Quincy. I want nothing and Brisler says having done without his Things so long, he had rather do without them now till We return. The Senators and Representatives say that We must sit here  May. Some hope to be up in April. I cannot flatter myself to be at home till the first of May. If the Yellow Fever should make its Appearance, We shall seperate earlier, but the general opinion and universal hope is that it will not return at all: at least till after the extream Heats of summer.  Smith spent about a fortnight here and is now returned. He is tormented by his Ambition but has taken very unsagacious measures to remove his Pains. I know not what he is in Pursuit of.  "

","My dearest Friend I am weary of this Scene of . We have done nothing and shall do nothing this Session, which ought to be done, unless We should appropriate a sufficient sum of Money, for treating with the Algerines. We are afraid to go War, though our Inclinations and Dispositions are Strong enough to join the French Republicans. It is happy that our Fears are a Check to our Resentments: and our Understandings are better then our Hearts. One day spent at home would afford me more inward Delight and Comfort than a Week or a Winter in this Place. We have frequent  and Allarms about the yellow fever: but when they come to be traced to their Sources they have hitherto proved to be false. There is one at present in Circulation which is not quite cleared up, and the Weather is extreamly warm, muggy foggy and unfavourable for the Season. The River is open and some say is never frozen over after this time. Others say there have been Instances in the last week in January.  Thomas visits me of Evenings and We converse concerning Hampden and Faulkland, Charles and Oliver Essex and Rupert of whose Characters and Conduct he reads every day in Lord Clarendon. I fear he makes too many Visits in Families where there are young Ladies. Time is spent and nothing learn'd. Pardon me! Disciple of Woolstoncroft I never relished Conversations with Ladies accepting with one at a time and alone rather than in Company I liked not to loose my time. I begin not to think all time lost, that is not employed in Farming, innocent, healthy gay, elegant Amusement! Enchanting Employment! How my imagination roves over my rocky Moutains and through my brushy Meadows!  "

Your Letter is a feast to me -- am happy to learn you have so good a . It is not worth while for Barneveld to continue long to altercate with such a loose head as Americanus. Your similitude of the Eagle and Snake  is very apposite. You have in the Papers all that passes here. The New Senators are not all of them quite so good as the old ones. The Funding System the Bank and all  Credit is struck at: but without success. The Spirit of Party is very subtle although very violent. But I trust will be defeated. The Democratical Societies which it is said are to correspond with each other have a Tendency to carry Party Spirit to its hight and to produce more Shases Rebellious. It is Malancholly that every Thing in  France as well as America should conspire so perfectly to demonstrate over again all my Books.  My Books revealed to them seven Years ago all that has happened since. Yet they do no good. Judge Peters and his Lady present their Respects to you and desire me to  a Receipt to cure the Ague. I drank Tea last Evening with Dr. Rush. He seems worn and weakened by his great Exertions and fatigues and sickness altogether: but is still  and chearful. He enquired after your health and sends his respects &c. He had an Aweful summer of last. I sent you 200 hundred dollars. Have you received it? We have two days of cold Weather and it now snows so fast that I hope We shall have a close February and March. The Police will not cleanse the Streets of this City and I fear they will repent of it next summer. Dr. Green thinks the Plague from the  Levant was brought in the  Marseielles last Year.  is well and all the rest. I fear too that Cheesman is lost but will still hope for him. I am afraid I shall not get home till June. Not that We need still so long: but We will.  I conjecture the Votes will generally run for Mr. Adams Mr. Gerry and Mr. Dana and that two of the three will be chosen. I wish the old Fellow was a little more national: but he cannot do much harm and will not last long. Master Cleverly used to say thirty Years Ago  ""I pitty Mr. Sam. Adams for he was born a Rebel."" I hope he will not die one.  "

","My dearest Friend The Mail of Yesterday brought me, a rich Treasure of  your kind Letters of the 18 ,  24   and 25th of January . Ice in the Rivers or some other Obstructions on the Roads have  the Conveyance of some of them and occasioned their Arrival all together. Columbus and Barneveld were both written with  and Spirit and the poor Wretches who so justly fell under their Lashes were never before nor since so exemplarily and so justly punished. I hope my old Friend, will never meet the Fate of another Preacher of Egalite, who was I fear almost as sincere as himself. By The Law of Nature, all Men are Men and not Eagles, That is they are all of the same species. And this is the most That the Equality of Nature amounts to. But Man differs by Nature from Man, almost as much as Man from Beast. The Equality of Nature is Moral and Political only and means that all Men are independent. But a Physical Inequality, an Intellectual Inequality of the most serious kind is established unchangeably by the Author of Nature. And Society has a Right to establish any other Inequalities it may judge necessary for its good.   The Precept however Do as you would be done by implys an Equality which is the real Equality of Nature and Christianity, and has been Known and understood in all Ages before the Lt. G. of  Massachusetts made the discovery in January 1784. I am pleased to hear that the Court appointed again their late State Attorney. Mr. Daston called on me a few weeks ago to communicate to me a great Secret. The President had the Evening before took him aside and  of him very particularly concerning the Vice Presidents son at  Boston: his Age, his Practice, his Character &c &c &c, at the same time making great Inquiries Concerning Mr. Parsons of  Newbury Port. From all which Mr. D conjectured that Mr. Gore was to be appointed Attorney Gen. of  U.S. and J. Q. Adams Attorney for the District. . . . I was somewhat allarmed and was determined to Advize my son to refuse it, if it should be so, though I did not believe it. I would not advize Mr. J. Q. A. to play at Small Games in the Executive of  U.S. I had much rather he should be State Attorney for  Suffolk. Let him read Cicero and Demosthenes. Much more eloquent than Madison and Smith. The rascally Lie about the Duke of York in a Cage at  Paris and  Toulon and all the English Fleet in the Hands of the  was fabricated on purpose to gull the Gudgeons and it completely succeeded to my infinite mortifications. An Attempt was made to get me to read the red hot Lie in Senate in order to throw them into as foolish a Confusion as that below them: but I was too old to be taken in, at least by so gross an Artifice the falshood of which was to me palpable.  You Apologize for the length of your Letters and I ought to excuse the shortness and Emptiness of mine. Yours give me more entertainment than all the speeches I hear. There is more good Thoughts, fine strokes and Mother Wit is worth in them than I hear in the whole Week. An Ounce of Mother Wit is worth a Pound of Clergy and I rejoice that one of my children at least has an Abundance of not only Mother Wit, but his Mothers Wit. It is one of the most amiable and striking Traits in his Compositions. It appeared in all its Glory and severity in Barneveld. If the Rogue has any Family Pride, and it in all derived from the same source. His Pa renounce and abjures every Trace of it. He has Curiosity to know his descent and comfort in the Knowledge that his Ancestors on both sides for several Generations have been innocent. But no Pride in this. Pomp Splendor, Office Title, Power, Riches are sources of Pride, but even these are not excuse for Pride. The Virtues and Talents of Ancestors should be considered as Examples and  Trusts and Produce Meekness Modesty and Humility, least they should not be imitated and equalled, Mortification and Humiliation can be the only legitimate feelings of a Mind conscious that it falls short of its Ancestors in Merit. I must stop.  "

Remember me to her in the most affectionate and dutiful manner. You ask me I wish to give any Directions. I pray you not to let the good old Lady know that you have asked or I answered such a question.

Congress have been together, more that two Months and have done nothing, and will continue sitting two Months longer, and do little. I for my part am wearied to death, with Ennui. Obliged to be punctual by my habits, confined to my Seat, as in a Prison to say nothing done, hear nothing said, and to say and do nothing. Oh that my Rocks were here within a mile or two, and my little habitation and pretty pretty little Wife above all. Ah I fear that some fault unknown has brought upon me, such Punishments to be  both when We were too young and when We are too old. I dont believe we shall adopt Mr. Madisons Motions nor build a Navy: But if we do not  purchase a Peace with the Algerines We shall all deserve to become their Captives. The Gentians had a frolic on the 6th in commemaration of the Treaty and drank Toasts enough to get merry. So cordial so loving so fraternal, so neat and elegant, so sweet and pretty! Have you read them. Franklin Bryant, Reed, Hutchinson and Sergeant the Heroes. Fit company for Dallas, Mifflin and Genet. No harm done however that I hear of. A sharp shot or two at the President. The  made in our Trade I fear will distress Us. I suspect that immense sums, borrowed of Banks have fallen a sacrifice in  France, as well as on the leas and when the day of Payment comes, more Credits must be given or Bankruptcies ensue. Borrowing of Banks for a trading Capital, is very unmercantile. However We shall not go to war, and nothing is to be dreaded so much as that. I fear The English will have all the  West Indies leaving a little to  Spain. This I dont like at all.  We shall see what another Campain will do in  Europe. If the English assist  La Vendee, which if they had been cunning or wise they would have done last year it is thought that  Brittany  Normandy and  Pickardy will declare for a thing: But of this there can be no certainty. I am going to dinner at Mr. Daltons with Judge and Mrs. Cushing who will call on you on her return and tell you the News in the South. My Mother I hope is growing better. Remember me to her tenderly.   "
NA,"My dearest Friend So! The Tables are turned on the French Faction! And The English Faction will exult in their Turn, in the Prospect of The  West India Islands a Conquest to  England: The French Navy wholly ruined: and Insurrection spreading from Province to Province.  I see no Cause of Joy is all these Exhalations in either side. I am compelled to console myself as well as I can. Est Aliquis in dolende decor: hic sapienti servandus est: et quem admodum in caetoris rebus, ita et in lachrimus aliquid sat est. Imprudentium ut guadia, sic dolores exundavere. AEqoe animo excipe necessavia. Seneca. Ep. 100. Dont be impatient for the meaning of these Mysteries. Wait till  comes up to translate them. Indeed and in Truth I see no Consolation upon these , but in Stoicism, or Christianity. I am no more delighted with the Idea of The  West Indies in the hands of the English, than I was with  Brabant and  Flanders in the Power of Dumourier.  "

","My dearest Friend Vive la Baggatelle! Duke est desipere. I have no other Resource in my solitude, amidst all my gloomy forebodings of the future Miseries of my beloved species. Our Allies, our only Alies as the Demi=Crazies  call them, have completed their System by turning all their Churches into, Je ne scais quor and if they should have any government erected among them either by themselves or others, they may substitute Chorus's of Boys and Girls to chant Prayers like the Romans.   Their Prayers will probably be heard, and War Pestilence and Famine may be ready to sieze the Austrians and Britons; as soon as they have satiated themselves with  in  France. I hope however that the awful example of that Country, whether it shall be like to those of  Tyre and  Sydon,  Sodom and  Gommorohs, or whether it shall terminate less fatally; will be a warning to all other Nations and to Ours especially.  The Britons and Spaniards by taking the  West India Islands, and attempting to hold them will only foundations for future wars, to restore them. In short I see no End of Wars. It is a Comfort to reflect that they can do no greater Evil to Men than put an End to their Lives. What think the Clergy of  New England? What says Mr. Wibird? Do they still admire the French Republicans? Do they think them Virtuous? Do they wish to see them imitated by all Nations? Do they wish to resign all their salaries? and to have their Churches all turned into Riding Houses,  the Sabbeth abolished and one day in ten substituted to sing songs to the Manes of Manat. Oh my Soul! come not thou into the Secrets of such Republicans. The Guillotine itself would not make me a sincere Republican upon such Conditions. The Spirit, Principals and System of rational Liberty to all Nations is my Toast: but I see no  to any Thing but Anarchary, Licentiousness and Despotism. Mankind will not learn Wisdom from Experience.  "

Present her my dutiful affection and tell her that I hope to enjoy the Pleasure of her Company yet for many Years, That I am of her Opinion that she has the best Daughter and that the best Mother ought to have such a Daughter. It is Day about with the Newsmongers.  France is in not so good a Way. Even Mr. Butler told me this day that  ""he turned away his face and thoughts from  France with Disgust and Horror."" A shambles is called a Republic. And if they would but have read the Discourses on Davilia they would have seen all this foretold in plain Language. St. Barthelomews days are there said to be the natural and necessary Consequence of such a form of Government, aussi longtems qu'il plaira a Dieu. I am weary of this eternal Indecision. I wish for the Times when Old Sam. And Old John conducted with more wisdom and more success. This is Egotism enough to deserve the Guillotine to be sure but I cannot but recollect old scenes, and old Results. The Rascals are now abusing the President as much as ever they abused me. And We shall see that a life of disinterested Devotion to the  is no more sacred in him than in another. In this Days Paper he is compared to Cosmo De Medicis to Sylla to Caesar: and charged with arbitrary illegal Conduct in many particulars particularly in the Proclamation respecting Duplaine. He cannot get out, any more than Stirling, but I believe he desires it as fervently.  I am determin'd to be saucy and I say that a Parcell of ignorant Boys who know not a rope on the Ship, have the Vanity to think themselves able Seamen. We ought to authorize the President in perfect secrecy to go as far as two hundred Thousand Pounds to obtain a perpetual Peace with the Algerines. Build a frigate if you will but expect they will be useless because unmanned. But there is not a Member of either House who is not more master of the Subject than I am, so I should be modest.  "

It is impossible to say precisely when Congress will rise: but I will go home as soon as possible; I hope in April, I am very willing to confide all arrangements to you. I like Shaw and his Wife: and I like Richards and Joy from your Account of them. We will try a dairy at each house: ten Cows at Thayers and Ten at Faxons, but they must all go to pasture up  Pens hill, till after mowing the fresh Meadows, I wish you to buy as many Yearling Calves and two year olds as you can, and Cows to make up the N. 20 reserving two for our own home. I have sent an 100 wt. of Clover seed and twelve Quarts of herds Grass. Shaw may go into Thayers House the first of March if he will, and if you have not other Employment he may mow Bushes in the Pasture opposite, I shall plant again where Faxon planted last Year. The Fences should be put up as early as may be, and the manure carted in Season.  My Mothers Indisposition continues to affect me most sensibly I hope for her Blessing on You and me and on all our Posterity-- and I thank you for your tender Care and dutiful Attention to her, and I hope you will continue to supply every want as far as may be in our power. As We are not to live long in this earthly Residence, she has remained longer, and fullfilled every Duty of Life better than mankind in general, and We shall again meet her I hope in a better World. This is scarcely worthy of Persons of her Character. She goes to the world where our Fathers are gone, and We much soon follow.  "

","My dearest Friend We have done nothing hitherto, but Prevent our Countrymen from plunging blindfold into a War, with they know not whom, and for they know not what. If We continue to sit  Time, and do no more nor less We shall do well.  Tomorrow the Senate is to discuss the Election of Mr. Gallatin, with their Doors open for the first Time. Whether a Vote will be carried for building a Gallery or for keeping the Doors open upon other Occasions of Legislative and Judiciary Business I know not. You gave me, in one of your last Letters, one of your sly Jokes about Family Pride. I answer in the Words of Horace which I desire your Son and mine to translate for you and study well for himself. It is not however the less true, as He says  line 33 Nor is it less true as he says in the 19th Line You may however tell John that he is in more danger of  Attention from the fault of Virgil than from family Pride. He may read it in the 3d Latyr. V. 30. There I have given you Riddles enough to vex you.  I have shipped an hundred weight of Clover Seed and twelve Quarts of Herds Grass, which is to be sown, one half of it at least in the last Years  with the Barley. Brisler has shipped some Rye flour. It is nearly time for our Tar Brushes to be brandishing round the Apple trees. , I hope has an Abundance of Business, which takes up all the Time for that fact is the only admissable Excuse for his not writing me.

","My dearest Friend The Birthday was celebrated Yesterday with as much Joy affection and Festivity as ever, and as it happened the New French Minister was then presented. Poor Genet I fear is undone. Bad as his Conduct has been I cannot but pity him. What will become of him I know not. The Name of his Sucessor is Fauchet. Gloomy as I was in expectation daily of Afflicting News from home, I contented myself with paying my Respects to The President with the Senate but I thought it would not become me to be present at the Ball of a Saturday night, especially at a time when I could not get it out of my Thoughts that  might be closing her Eyes forever. The Senate has been several Days trying a contested Election of Mr. Gallatin, with their Doors open. It is at length determined that a Gallery is to be built and our Debates public, at the next Session of Congress.  What the effect of this measure, which was at last carried by a great majority, will be, I know not but it cannot produce greater Evils than the contest about it, which was made an Engine to render unpopular some of the ablest and most independent Members. Some of the younger Members may descend from their Dignity so far perhaps as to court Popularity at the Expence of Justice Truth and Wisdom, by flattering the prejudices of the Audience but I think they will loose more Esteem than they will acquire by such means. If  still lives send her my Duty and tender Sympathy under her Affliction.   "

","My dearest Friend Yesterday I received  your kind Letter of the 14th  and I thank you again   for your unwearied Attention to my venerable Parent which critical Situation is never out of my Thoughts. I am quite easy on one account as I know that every tender Care will be employed by you, in concert with my Brother and his Family for her relief and Preservation, if that is permitted. My Mothers Blessing which you transmit me is more prescious to me than Gold or Diamonds. Should the Melancholly Event, which We deprecate, occur, I should wish that the last respects may be paid at my House, if my Brother is willing. I should wish to have Pratts Account Paid as soon as you can . I shall soon send you some more money for your necessary Expences. The Senate with open Doors and a crowded Audience are discussing Mr. Gallatins Election, which made the  of my Duty, heavy. I am obliged to sitt early and late in my Chair. I have done so much of this patient Drudgery for five Years, that I am quite satiated with it.   "
"Philadelphia  March 2d. 1794
","My dearest Friend The Senate were obliged to Spend the whole of the last Week, in a Solemn  of the Election of Mr. Galatin: and I find that a great Impression has been made upon the Public by the Learning Eloquence and Reasoning of Some of the Senators. The Decision has given general Satisfaction. That Popularity was more courted than Truth by a few Individuals, I fear will be the Judgment of some of the most enlightened and independent Spectators. I have been again unfortunate at Sea. The  in which I shipped my grass seeds and two barrels of Rye flour for you has been run down and sank in the River by a large ship. Most of the Cargo was saved but whether my Adventure was saved or lost I have not yet learned. The weather,  has been very warm and the Snow which generally covered the Earth this morning is I presume nearly gone. The spring will advance with rapid Strides and I shall be impatient to be at home: but I cannot prevail upon myself to ask leave of Absence from my Post at this critical Time, when we know not what Questions or Events a day may bring forth. The new French Minster, M. fauchet is about 33. He is not quite So unreserved as his Predecessor: but he seems to me to be in great distress. He was recieved by the Galleries in the Threatre with three Cheers: but the People have not addressed him or made much Noise about him. At the Birthnight Ball, he was placed by the managers on the right hand of the President, which gave great Offense to the Spanish Commissioners: and it is said Mr. Hammond has left the Theatre, offended or digusted  at some partial popular distinctions there. My  Anxiety for my mother prevents me from visiting Theatres and Assemblies, so that  I know nothing but Hearsay. The Discussions of last week kept me five or Six hours  in so close a Confinement and the Croud of Hearers injured the Air, so that I was almost Sick but a Day or two of rest has relieved me in some degree. I long for my home, but that is not to be my felicity for some time.  Young Mr. Otis is here under Dr. Shippens hands in a very  situation. Thomas Lee Shippen is in a dangerous Way.   "
"Philadelphia  March 8, 1794
","My dearest Friend Your  of Feb 26  and Feb (blank) arrived not till last night. They deserve my best Thanks on all accounts. They are full of Entertainment and Instruction. S.  is as Slippery as an Eel: He is not worth quarreling with but certainly is not to be trusted. His Treaty with  Spain is a great Curiousity. I am really at a loss to guess, whether it was Ignorance or Impudence. He has so much of both, and at the Same time so much Imagination and Volubility, as to make a Character quite original. As John has swipped whipped him at the Whipping Post, with at least thirty nine lashes, well laid on, and can lash him again or set him in the Pillory whenever he deserves it, it is not worth while to break with him in any other Way. There are no moral Feelings in him which John can ever confide in or attach himself to. honour, Fidelity Sincerity, friendship, Gratitude, Candour, are not, locked up in that Casket. We have not so forward a Spring as Usual. Snow and Rain and Cold Weather. This may be  on Account of the Epidemic: but may produce other Complaints. Senators talk of rising the first Monday of April, but will not before May. The News from  MontSerat, of the Capture and Condemnation of , upon pretense of a violation of a Decree of the late King of  France, has occasioned a more Serious Allarm than any Thing before: and if thinking Men were not more afraid of the Friendship of  France than of the Emnity of  England, they would indulge their Resentments more than they do.  To make a common Cause with Such Characters, to form intimate Connections; to communicate sentiments, to participate Principles morals religious or political with Such a sett, is worse than all the Usual horrors of War. But I doubt whether this People will bear, another whole Year, the detention of the Posts and the depredations in their Trade. The new French Minister Fauchet is a very different character from Genet. I dined with both together at the Governors on Wednesday. Fauchet is reserved cautious, discreet, hitherto. Young; not more than 33. Genet was as gay as if nothing had happened to him. I have not heard whether John attended the Town meeting on the 26th, I believe of  Otis came forward We are told and got Applause. Petry, the French Consul, brought me the Regards of our old Friend The Abby Arnoux. The Abby De Chalut is dead. Arnoux lives still in the old Apartment in the  Place Vendome. I have dined with Fauchet at the Presidents, Mr. Meades, Governor Mifflins and Mr. Morris's. The President on Monday sent me a kind invitation to a seat in his Coach and in his Box at the Theatre. The Building is large handsome and convenient, the  neat enough, and the Company of Acters well enough. The House was crowded in every Part. If you see the Journals of the Senate, you will observe the name of L   among an entire new Sett of Names, in several Questions. The approaching Election of Governor as well as Senator, is suspected to give him some Anxiety. His Popularity is not represented to be so dear as it has been. He Seems hurried and worried. His Vanity more puerile. His understanding less discerning, if that is possible. In Short he is become the Pity, the Ridicule and Contempt alternately of his old Friends. The Dupe and Bubble of his old Opponents. From your Accounts of the situation of , I must give up the expectation of seeing her again. While my Gratitude to you for your unwearied Attention to her Circumstances is in proportion to my Gratitude to her for her tender constant Solicitude for me from my Birth; my Prayers are incessant that she may be Supported with divine Consolations in her last Days and rewarded with the Joys of the faithful, forever.  "
"Philadelphia  March 11. 1794
","My dearest Friend I received Yesterday  your kind Letter of  28. and March 1 . I can never be sufficiently thankful to you for your constant unwearied attention and tender care of my Mother. I hope that you will be very careful of your own Health and not suffer your Solicitude and Exertions to go beyond your Strength. Our Selfish young Rogue at  Boston is so taken up with his Business and his Fees, that he has not written me  this Winter. However he has done a Public Service of more importance than is or ever will be acknowledged, by any Body but his father and Mother. The Federalists must be in high Spirits to threaten Such mighty Things. But I doubt their Power, their Union, their Spirit too much. They are Seeking Popularity and Loaves and Fishes as well as the Anti's and find it inconvenient to act a decided open Part in . But for this, many Things would have gone better. But for this your Husband would not have been Sacrificed, nor the unrivalled unexampled Writings of your Son persecuted or neglected, as they have been. Let him listen to the Charge of a Father to mind his private Business and keep himself forever independent of the Smiles or Frowns of political Parties. A rigorous Frugality in Spight of all the Sneers of Bankrupts, Debauchees and Puppies.  A Solid Income from a landed Estate in the Country; an unwearied Attention to study and Business: and an Integrity inexorrable to every temptation, will carry him, as it has his father, through Life with more comfort and Honour and enable him to do more good than hundreds of thousands of Reptiles and Insects by which he may be sometimes annoied. You go on in the Conduct of your Farm with so much Spirit, amidst all your  avocations, that it is a noble Regale to read your Letters. Plant the Ground which broke up last fall with corn. Sow Barley, where We had corn last Year. Plant again the lower Garden. Potatoes again at the Beach Meadow. Plant again again Farons last Years Corn field. Buy as many Cows and young Stock as you can keep in plenty. Send the sheep as soon as convenient to the Pasture by Harmands Harmans. I shall send you some Money in a  or three Weeks. I know not whether John was at the  Boston Town Meeting.  Smiths Meeting at New York did not terminate so gloriously quite, as that at the Old South.   "
"Philadelphia  March 12. 1794
","My dearest Friend I have all along flattered myself with hopes that I might with Propriety have taken Leave of the Senate and returned home, as soon as the Roads might be settled: But such is the critical State of our public Affair, and I daily hear Such Doctrines Advanced, and Supported by almost and sometimes quite one half of the Senate, that I shall not prevail on myself to abandon my Post. This Day the Senators were equally divided upon a Question, which seemed to me to involve nothing less than Peace and War, and I was obliged to decide it, to the no Small Chagrin of a Number. If this Country is involved in War, it shall not be by my fault. But if it comes either from the Malice of our  or the Imprudence of our own People.   It may perhaps be found, that I shall not shrink from its Difficulties, sooner than some who now seek it in disguise. Business is nor carried on with rapidity In both Houses, and I shall have a month of Severe Duty. I have not been Absent a Day. It is to be sure a Punishment to hear other Men talk five hours every day, and not be at Liberty to talk at all myself: especially as more than half I hear appears to me very young inconsiderate and inexperienced. The  Boston Town Meeting as it terminated did a Service to the Public. If Government must be affronted or intimidated by popular  and partial Meetings of the People, it is a Pity that our Cities are not all as capable of as  Boston of discussing great questions. But in  New York and  Philadelphia there is Meeting against Meeting and Clubb against Clubb, to the Utter Confusion of the public Opinion.  It is rumoured that We are to loose two Ministers of State by resignation, but I would not have the report propagated from me. I Suffer many  hours on Account of my dear Mother, and as many on your Account. Your Tryal must be severe, and I often wish I were with you to chear up your Spirits and share a Part of your Cares. The Spring opens: The Birds sing; the Weather is fine, and all Things  but my thoughts about my home, and our public Prospects.   "
"Philadelphia  March 15. 1794
","My dearest Friend I know not how to throw off, the Lassitude that hangs upon me. Weary of a daily round, which to me is more confined and more insipid than to any other, I would gladly go home: but at a time So critical as this, it would not be justifiable, to quit my Post If there were no particular Reasons against it. But as The Senate is nearly divided in all great questions, and the President pro tem, has lately taken it in his head to Shift his Box, my retirement would give an entire new Complexion to the Government. This Circumstance however must not be repeated from me: but it is true. Great Pains have been and Still are taken to inflame the Populace of  Philadelphia and  New York, and they have no Method to correct this heat by a Town Meeting and by the temperate Reasonings of the Soundest Part of the Community, as they have at  Boston: the Consequence of which is that  meets to countract Clubb, Merchants to undo what Merchants or pretended Merchants have done, and the public Opinion Is a Chaos, a Proteus any Thing every Thing and nothing. Yet all Sides trumpet and dogmatize about the public opinion. If the  New England People Suffer themselves to be artfully drawn into a War, they will be Dupes indeed, for all the Men and most of the Money must be forced from them, and while others, will throw off the Burden of British Debts, and obtain all the Advantages of Fur and Petry Trades and Western Lands, We have not the smallest Thing to hope unless it be by Privateering, and such is now the tremendous Naval Superiority against Us that We shall  more than gain by that. A General Dearbourne from the Eastward and a Mr. Lyman from  Northhampton discover a Disposition to go wrong. Whether the first wants Employment in an Army I know not. The last is a Pupil and Correspondent of Sullivan, certainly: probably of Jarvis and Austin. He has a false a Subtle and a malicious Countenance: This I know, from my Sight. That he is so in realty I have heard. But a Pettifoger a Tool to Sullivan is enough to decide a Character, and by Such Characters is this Country to be cursed with War, and an Additional Debt of hundreds of Millions, while they are every hour declaiming against Debt and Taxes. Raynal prayed that rather than lien should always be Knaves and Fools, the Species might be annihilated. At present it seems in a fair way to be so. I love them too well with all their faults to be glad to see their present rapid Progress towards destruction. All that I have and all that I am would I  give to prevent it. But I see no means. Havock must have Its perfect work and then Eyes will begin to open. It is some relief against  to laugh: and Libells themselves evil as they are have their Uses. The Inclosed from  New York may divert you and the more because so because you are a stranger as well as I to most of the Characters. The Patriots in  New York should seem to be at least as pure Characters as those at  Boston, if the Poem is not more fiction.  I have some hopes that your next Letter will inform me  is better.   "

It grieves me to think that you are called to go through this melancholly Scene without the Participation of your Partner: But the Distresses of our Country have often destined Us to such Misfortunes for which We have little praise and less Thanks. The Prospects of our Country at this time are far from being bright. The Infatuation of our People has I fear brought upon them Resentments, more lasting and more fatal than they are aware. I still hope however that We shall not be involved in War: but our Madmen will provoke it if they can. Brisler is this day beginning to Ship our Goods on board a Vessel that is to carry them into  Quincy Creek if he can. They must be carried on shore in the Scow I believe.

","My dearest Friend Cheesman has at length arrived and I have received my Trunk in much better order than I expected. The People here are much cooler than they were last Week. The Embargo begins to be felt by many who have been the most noisy and turbulent. Speculation mingles itself in every political Operation and many Merchants have already made a noble Spec. of the Embargo by raising their Prices: but the foolish Tradesmen and  who were so ready to follow the heels of their Scheeming Leaders are now out of Employment, and will loose 30 dollars a head by this Embargo. If they had been taxed half the sum to the most necessary and important Measure they would have bitterly complained. I can see little benefit in the Embargo except that it may cool down the Courage of such kind of People. It may be expected that We shall soon have a Clamour against the renewal of it, if not to have it repealed. The Assembly of  Pennsylvania have this day chosen a Senator Mr. James Ross of  Washington County in the Place of Mr. Gallatin.  A violent Measure has been proposed in the House to sequester all Debts due for from American Citizens to British Subjects. Such a Motion will do no honour to our Country. Such Laws are injurious to the Debtor as well as the Creditor, for they cannot annul or dissolve the Contracts. It will not pass the House, and if it did, it would stop in the Senate. We are rejoiced that the civic Feast in  Boston succeeded no better. It is astonishing that Mr. Adams should ever have thought of implicating the Government in so indecent and hostile a . We have had an incessant Struggle, all Winter to restrain the intemperate  of the People out of Doors and their too accurate Representatives in both Houses. Too many of our good Federalists are carried away at times by their Passions and the popular Torrent, to concur in motions and countenance Sentiments, inconsistent with our Neutrality and tending directly to Tar. But I hope We shall be able to make a stand against all fatal Attempts. I long to be at home, but I dare not ask leave to go. The Times are too critical for any Man to quit his Post without the most urgent necessity. Ways and Means must be provided to  the Expences incurred and I expect this will be put off till May. I shall be very uneasy through this whole month, but I must take Patience. I hope Mr. Adams of  Boston, the Lawyer is full of Business and making his Fortune. I hear so seldom from him that I must suppose him busy.  my dear Mother that I hope to have the Pleasure of seeing her in the Month of May. Love to my Brothers and Sister and Cousins &c.  "

","My dearest Friend The Post of the day brought me,  your kind Letter of 26 . Ult. The more I am charmed with Bravery and Activity in farming the more I am mortified that my Letters in Answer to yours are so insignificant and insipid. I must leave all your Agriculture to your Judgment and the Advice of your . I sent you more Grass seeds with the Furniture, which I hope has arrived before now. Mr. Adams has sent you the 500 before now. I will sent you a little more if I can possible spare it. The Times are so critical and Parties so nearly  that I cannot in honour, nor consistently with my Duty abandon my Post. There are so many wild Projects and Notions and so many to support them, that I am become of more importance than Usual, in the Opinion of the soundest Part of the Community. We have very  Business to do in finding Ways and means for the Expences We have already incurred. It grieves me to the heart to see an increase of our Debts and Taxes, and it vexes me to see Men opposing even these Augmentations who are every day pushing for Measures that must involve Us in War, and ten times greater Expences.  But the Inconsistencies and Absurdities of Men are no Novelties to me. I have pleased myself with a hope that I should get home in April: but the general Opinion is We shall be obliged to remain here  the middle of May. I have little Expectation of seeing you before Election. You are so valourous and noble a farmer that I feel little anxious about Agriculture. Manure in Hills, if you think best: but manure your Barley ground well and harrow it well. I have now the pleasing hope of seeing  again in comfortable health. I have suffered many melancholly hours both on her Account and Yours, and I think myself, indebted under Providence to your tender Care and indefatigable Assiduity, for the Prolongation of her Life. If the Yellow fever should  its Appearance here We shall soon fly: but there is no symptom of it as yet. I am sometimes obliged to give critical Votes which expose me to the Passions of Parties: but I have been wonder fully spared this Session. They find it best to let me alone; for I get credit by their Abuse.  "
"Philadelphia  April 5. 1794
","My dearest Friend The Weather is cooler and the Minds of Men are calmed by the  Communication. But A  Party will plunge Us if possible. The most uncandid; the most hypocritical Part is acted to take Us in. Protestations against War by those who are pushing every Thing that can force War, are not the Worst. The southern Men have Art enough to dupe northern ones to bring forwards measures, that the northern Part may have the Odium of bringing on a War. In short the Knavery of some is so abominable and the Stupidity of others so contemptible, that I am almost brought to Raynalls Wish. The old Debtors to  Britain uniting with those who are bribed to  France, and both operating on the Populaces of our great Towns, will devote this Country to Calamities as unnecessary as they will be dismal: Unless the Vigilance and Patience of those who have no Object but their Countries Good is supported by the sound Part of the People out of Doors. My good and worthy son, I presume sees all I send you.. All my hopes are in him: both for my Family and Country.  "
"Philadelphia  April 7. 1794
","My dearest Friend Your  of the 28th.  Ult. arrived this morning. Before this time I hope you have received your furniture. We are still  to preserve Peace. But one moves a Series of commercial Regulations, another a Sequestration of Debts, a third to prohibit all Intercourse with  Britain, a fourth to issue Letters of Mark against Algerines, all tending to excite Suspicions in  Britain that We are hostile to her and mean ultimately to join her Ennemies. One firebrand is scarcely quenched before another is thrown in: and if the sound Part of the Community is not uncommonly active and attentive to support Us We shall be draw off from our Neutral Ground and involved in incomprehensible Evils. In danger of a War, that will be unnecessary if not unjust; that has no public Object in View; that must be carried on with Allies the most dangerous that ever existed, my Situation is as  as any I ever knew. I should have no fear of an honest war, but  a knavish one would fill me with disgust and Abhorrence. At nine o Clock at night I suppose your Election is over, and another fortnight will enable Us to guess whether An Adams or a Cushing is to the great Man. Although the Old Gentlemans Conduct is not such as I can approve in many Things of late Years, Yet I find it difficult to believe that the People of  Massachusetts will forsake him in his last moments. ! his Grandeur must be of short duration if it ever commences. I shall be happier at home, if Cushing succeeds and the State I believe will be more prudently conducted. The Federalists have ventured on a dangerous . I am afraid the Delicacy which has usually attended Elections in  New England, will be inured if not destroyed by these Elections of Governors and Senators, so as to be never regained even in the Choice of Representatives. But We must fulfill our Destiny. I am afraid I shall not see you till Election. I never longed more to be at home. Yours most tenderly,  "
"Philadelphia  April 15. 1794
","My dearest Friend Upon the receipt of your excellent Letter of the fifth of this month I yesterday sent for our son  and desired him to remit to his Brother at  Boston for your Use two hundred Dollars. I have been at Expence to Purchase a Horse Saddle and Bridle and Saddle bags to fix out Thomas to ride the Circuit with his Master Mr. Ingersol. He begins his Journey on the 28th of this Month. This has left me without Money to pay my Board and my Journey home. If the Money you have is not Sufficient ask my Friend the General whose kindness has so often obliged Us to lend you what you want and I will repay him in June. The House Yesterday passed a Resolution in Committee of the whole, whose Depth is to me unfathomable. The Senate will now  to called upon to show their Independence, and perhaps your Friend to chew his Weakness or his Strength. The Majesty of the House is certainly for Mischief, and there is no doubt they represent the People in the southern States and a large Number in the Northern. Vox Populi Vox Dei, they say: and so it is sometimes, but it is sometimes the Voice of Mohamet of Casar of Cataline the Pope and the Devil.  Britain however has done much amiss and deserves all that will fall thereon. Her Insolence which you and I have known and felt  more than any other Americans, will lead her to ruin, and Us half Way. We indeed are in point of Insolence her very Image and superscription. As true a Game Cook as she and I warrant you she'll become as great a scourge to Mankind. Our Furniture has had its last removal. Your Distress and Distraction at its landing is very strongly described. Whatever Crashes have happened shall be the last from Removals. My Countrymen are going into a Career, that I shall not long follow. I dont expect another Election. If I should peradventure ride out the storm for the Remainder of my Term. I long to see you, but I fear it will be late in May if not the beginning of June.   "
"Philadelphia  April 19. 1794
","My dearest Friend Senate has been three days in debate upon the Appointment of Mr. Jay, to go to  London. It has this day been determined in his  18 vs. 8. You cannot imagine what horror Some Persons are in, least Peace Should continue. The Prospect of Peace throws them into Distress. Their Countenances lengthen at the least opening of an Appearance of It. Glancing Gleams of Joy beam from their Faces whenever all Possibility of it seems to be  off. You can divine the Secret source of those Feelings as well as I. The Opposition to Mr. Jay has been quickened by Motives which always influence  in an Elective Government. Pretexts, are never wanting to ingenious Men. But the Views of all the principal Parties are always directed to the Election of the first Majistrate. If Jay Should Succeed, it will recommend him to the Choice of the People for President as soon as a Vacancy shall happen. This will weaken the hopes of the Southern States for Jefferson. This I beleive to be the Secret Motive of the Opposition to him though other Things were alledged as ostensible Reasons: such as  His Monarchical Principles, his Indifference about the Navigation of the  Mississippi, his Attachment to  England his Aversion to  France, none of which are well founded, and his holding the office of Chief Justice &c. The Day is a good omen:  may the gentle Zephers waft him to his Destination and the Blessing of Heaven succeed his virtuous Endeavours to preserve Peace. I am so well Satisfied with their measure that I shall run the venture to ask leave to go home, if Congress determines to sitt beyond the middle of May. Mr. Adams is to be Governor, it Seems by a great Majority of the People: and I am not  at it. I should have thought human Nature dead in the  Massachusetts if it had been otherwise. I expect now he will be less antifederal. Gill is to be Lt. We will go to  Princetown again to congratulate him. I thought however that Gerry would have been the man. We are illtreated by  Britain, and You and I know it is owing to a national Insolence against Us. If They force Us into a War, it is my firm faith that they will be chastised for it a Second time worse than the first.     "
"Philadelphia  April 22. 1794
","My dearest Friend I received Yesterday  your kind  of the 11th . I have not been able lately to write you so much as I wished. The President has appointed Mr. Jay to go to  England as Envoy Extraordinary, in hopes that Satisfaction may be obtained for the Injuries done Us in the Capture of our Vessells. I have no very Sanguine hopes of his Success, but if any Man can Succeed I presume he is as likely as any. At least he will give as much Satisfaction to the American People as any Man. Mr. Adams's Election is no  to me. I should indeed have wondered if he had been disgraced and should have lessened my Veneration for the sentiments of Justice and Gratitude in the Breath of the People of  Massachusetts. I wonder not at his lukewarmness at the national Government. I wonder rather that I am not as indifferent to it, as he is. He knows as well as I do, what a kind of Ennemies We are associated with. I have no Apprehension that he will oppose or embarrass the general Government more than another. A Governor must ex officio be good for nothing. Mr. Gills Election was not so clearly  by me. He however can afford to be Lieutenant Governor or Governor as well as any Man, and is for what I know as well qualified. One thing I know We have three Governors in Senate neither of whom are a whit wiser or more virtuous than Mr. Gill. The People are most afraid of knowing and designing Men, as Governors. You conduct your Farm with great Spirit, and I wish you good Success. Last night and  We have a charming Rain after a long droughth. I hope you will have rain enough for a fruitful Season. I cannot answer your Question: but I hope the Appointment of an Envoy, will  our Adjournment by Some Days. Our Friend here is evidently disappointed. The Farm at  Brooklyne will prove like that at  Neponsit and like that at  Cambridge. These Advances to the Chair, are like the Advances of a Mistress: unless they are attempted with great Address and Delicacy they are Apt to cool the  of the Lover. The Election of Mr. Austin is no Way unexpected to me. The  who think he has Brains, in my Opinion are not wholly mistaken. I wish he had more liberal Connections and better informed Advisers. I wish he was a more Sincere Inquirer after Truth less under the Influence of Prejudices and less disposed to flatter the Prepossessions of others. The House has resolved to prohibit British Manufactures next November. Whether a Bill will pass as currently as the Resolve I know not. And what will be the Fate of the Bill if it comes, in the Senate I doubt not. The English have treated Us very ill: but Neutrality is so much preferable to War, that We shall bear Somewhat, rather than fight. We must not bear too much however. The American People must not  the Sentiment of their Forces, nor submit to too many and too deep humiliations.   "

As he will not return till June, I shall not probably see him again till next fall. He is enquiring for an Office, in Town. I cannot be confident that I can leave this City before June. But nothing shall prevent my leaving it before the tenth of that Month. I see no Reason however why Congress should Sit beyond the middle of May.   Pray is Mr. Crach Postmaster or not? "
"Philadelphia  April 30. 1794
","My dearest Friend Your  of 18th.   and 19th.  instant are so full of your Plans and Labours in Agriculture, that I begin to be jealous you will acquire a Reputation as a Farmer that will quite eclipse my own. I rejoice at length that all Tenants are dispossessed and that Land stock and Utensils are now at our own Disposal. I am glad you have bought a Yoke of Oxen and hope you will buy a farm horse.

","My Dearest Friend I Yesterday dined in Company with M. Talleyrand de Perigord and Mr. Beaumez, the former late Bishop of  and both Members of the late Constituent Assembly in  France. Talleyrand made the Motion for confiscating the Property of the Clergy: which, has made him so obnoxious to the Court of  Vienna, that they have persuaded the British Court to order him out of  England although he had been previously obliged to quit  France. There is at present a great Number of Men of Talents in this Country Fugitives from  Switzerland,  France, &c. &c. as well as  England,  Scotland, and  Ireland. These will do Us more harm than good, if we are not upon our Guard. I shall be at home by the middle of June, I hope.  is on the Circuit.  "
"Philadelphia  May 5, 1794
","My dearest Friend I must remain here, because my Friends say I must not go. Those whose Principles are the same with mine, whose Views of Public good coincide with mine, say that if We keep together We shall succeed to the End of the Session as we have hitherto , in keeping off all the most pernicious Projects. The Ways and Means before the H. of R. is a very important and a very difficult System. While I confess the necessity of it, and see its importance in giving Strength to our Government at home and Consideration to our Country abroad, I lament the introduction of Taxes and Expenses which will accumulate a perpetual Debt, and lead to future Revolutions. I regret every Moment I  here, but I cannot yet be sure that I can see you before June.  "

Mr. Jay is to immortalize himself over again by keeping Peace. This will depend on the  of the french. I begin to rejoice in their Successes more than I did. The English have treated us very ill.---  We must send a new Minister to  France and another to  Holland. Mr. Fauchet begins to grace our Democratic Societies with his Presence. This must not be carried very far. These Assemblies are very criminal.  "
"Phila.  May 10. 1794
","My dearest Friend We go on as Usual. Congress resolving one Thing and the Democratical societies resolving the Contrary. The President doing what is right and  and Mobs resolving it to be all wrong. We had in Senate a few Days ago the greatest Curiosity of all. The Senators from  Virginia moved, in Consequence of an Instruction from their Constituents, that the Execution of the 4th Article of the Treaty of Peace relative to bona fide Debts, should be suspended,   Britain should fulfill the 7th Article. When the Question was put 12 voted against it, two only, the  Virginia Delegates for it, and all the rest but one ran out of the Room to avoid voting at all and that one excused himself. This is the first Instance of the kind. The Motion disclosed the real object of all the wild Projects and mad Motions which have been made, during the whole session. Oh Liberty! Oh my Country! Oh Debt and Oh Sin! These Debtors are the Persons who are continually  against the Corruption of Congress. Impudence: Thy front is brass. The House is upon Ways and Means, which will take Us the rest of the Month I fear.  "
"Philadelphia  May 12. 1794
","My dearest Friend The Weather is here very hot and dry, which renders our daily Service in Congress more irksome and occasions Some Anxiety for the health of the People and more for the growth of the fruits. I hope you have more rain and less warmth. The House of R. have a Committee out, to prepare a Bill for the Ways and means: how long it will take the Members after the Report to make up their Minds, is also uncertain. But I think when the Senate get Possession of the Bill, it will not require so long a time for them to decide upon it, some way or other. I cannot flatter myself however that I can leave this City, in less than a fortnight. If I can fairly get in motion homewards by the 26th I shall be happy. I hear that the Friends of Mr. Adams were driven to their Shifts in  Boston. Obliged to assemble Lackies and footmen and Coachmen and an hundred free Negroes, to make up their Number. If this is true, I am sorry for it. The old Tories and their Satellites, have done much Injury to this Country by their constant Indulgence of their hatred of  the old Gentleman and their ill natured Opposition to him. He will forever defeat them, unless the People loose all sense of Justice as well as Gratitude. He has more Merit than them all, and in my Opinion will be as good a federalist as any, of them would be, after being chosen Governor. We shall never see a Governor an Overzealous Federalist. Clinton's Competitor is taken away from the Evil to come and there will be no Contest or but a faint one in that state, Unless Burr should become a Candidate.  has attended the Court at  Chester and  York town and is now I suppose at  Lancaster. He is pleased with his tour. Oh my farm when shall I see thee. Oh my dear Wife. But there will be no End of my tragic Oh 's and tragic Ah's.    "

","My dearest Friend The Alteration of Post Days or some other Cause has disappointed me of a Letter from you this Week, which is the first time I have  of a Letter on Monday for several months. The Weather has been very hot and dry here. Yesterday however We had a Light shower; but  it is very hot again. The House is slow upon the Ways and means the essential Measure which remains. But I think We shall rise by the first of June, and I fear not before, a tedious Six months it has been to me. The Senate have given a gentle Check to a very contemptuous Reprobation of the Measures of Congress, voted in the statehouse yard by a Number of Tobacconists and sugar Bakers &c. By the Way this statehouse Yard is a beautiful Thing formed on an English Plan, like the Inclosure in  Grosvenor Square. I walk there  for air and Exercise in the shade. It is not a  Paines Hill nor a stone, nor a Seasones, but it is pretty. I am, Patience almost exhausted,   "
"Philadelphia  May 17.1794
","My dearest Friend The long continuance of the session, and the uncommon heat and drought of the Weather have made this, to me an unpleasant Spring. And to increase my Mortification, I have this week received no Letter from you. I have not for Several months before, failed to receive a delicious Letter worth a dozen of mine, once a Week. Well:  Boston comes on: Mr. Morton is now to be its Leader: How changed in Reputation Since 1788: I wonder not at the Choice of Well-born Winthrop. He might I Suppose have been chosen at any time. His Father was one of my best Friends, and the Son was a good son of Liberty. I know of nothing to his Disadvantage. The Federalists committed an egregious Blunder, in a very unwarrantable and indecent Attempt, I had almost Said upon the freedom of Elections, at their previous Meeting for the Choice of Governor. The Opposite Party to be sure   practice Arts nearly as unwarrantable, in secret, and by sevl. agents with printed Votes. But this is no Justification unless upon Catos Principle In corrupta ceiotate Corruptio est licita, i.e. In a corrupt City Corruption is lawful. Elections are going the Usual Way in our devoted Country. Oh: that I had done with them. --We shall realize the raving in the Tempest, which  quoted to me in his last Letter. This is Lubberland indeed. Le Pays de Cocain, I believe the French call it. But it is terra incognito. I am afraid We shall have too many of its qualities without its innocence. I have no hope of Congress rising, before the last of May. Never in my Life did I long to see you more.   "
"Philadelphia  May 19. 1794
","My dearest Friend It is a fortnight  Since I had a Letter from you but it Seems to me a month. I cannot blame you for one of yours is worth four of mine. Three Bills, for laying Taxes are yet unfinished and there is little Reason to hope that they can be finished this Week, perhaps not before the End of the next. I cannot see much room to hope to get away before the first of June, a tedious Seven Months it has been and will be to me. The Committee of Merchants Mr. Norris of  Salem and Mr. Lyman of  Boston, have Seen how the Land lays here. They have returned to  Boston with more correct Views of Parties in Congress than they brought with them. The Projects for War, have been detected and exposed in every Shape and under every disguise that has been given them, and hitherto defeated. What another Year may bring forth I know not.  Britain will not be in a very good condition to provoke a fresh , in the Spring of 1795 with her 3 Per Cents Consolidated down at 55 or less; and they will probably be as low as that, even if the combined Powers should have better Success than they have had.   I have no Letter from Thomas last Week. He was at  Lancaster. Mr. John I hear rises in his Reputation at the Bar as well as in the Esteem of his fellow Citizens. His Writings have given him a greater Consideration in this Place than he is aware of. I am Sometimes told that I ought to be proud of him; and truly I dont want to be told this. He will be made a Politician too soon. But he is a Man of great Experience, and I hope sound Philosophy. He was a greater statesman at Eighteen, than Some Senators I have known at fifty. But he must learn Silence and Reserve, Prudence, Caution - above all to curb his Vanity and collect himself, faculties or Virtues that his Father has often much wanted. I have often thought he has more Prudence at 27, than his Father at 58.   "

Such a Succession of dry Years, no man remembers. , I fear, will not Stay with Us long. Dr. Welsh writes me discouragingly about her. My Duty to her. The Joke about V.

My Brother will not vote for War, I hope before it is necessary, as well as just. Great is the Guilt of unnecessary War.  I have not a doubt but the farm has been well governed. I wish the State and the Nation may be as well conducted. I cannot expect with any Confidence to see you before the 10th of June. I will sooner if I can. I lament the Death of a promising, ingenious Youth in Dr. Bracket: My Uncle Howard was a shock of Corn fully ripe. My Aunt and my Mother must soon be gathered. And then there will be  before me. The World is a Riddle, which Death, I hope will unravel.

","My dearest Friend I shall  with this, some Letters between Randolph and Hammond which will shew you how quarelsome they are. Poor Fellows! They both desire Peace, but think themselves obliged to wrangle for their Countries. It is fashionable to charge Wars upon things; but I think Le Peuple  is as inflamable, and as proud and at the Same time less systematick, uniform and united; so that it is not so easy for them to avoid Wars. We have laboured very hard to preserve our Tranquility; but the Peuple Souvereign is continually committing some Intemperance or Indiscretion or other tendency to defeat all our Precautions. If We are involved in a War, my head, heart, and hands shall be guiltless of the Crime of provoking it. But it will be my Duty to Submit to the Legal Voice and Decree of my Country. We have fine Rains here, for three days past, and I hope you enjoy a similar Blessing.  I shall take Leave on Saturday 31 of May! but cannot hope to get home before the 10 or 12th of June. The Journey lies before me, like a Mountain. I am too old and too feeble for these long Journeys, dry sessions and uncomfortable Scenes. I am at an Age when I ought to be at home with my Family. I Sent 600 dollars to  last Week, which is our whole Allowance till September. I wish you an  Election. Who will be Lieutenant Governor Gill or Gerry?

You must keep it an entire Secret, untill it shall be announced to the Public in the Journal of the Senate. But our Son must hold himself in readiness to come to  Philadelphia to converse with the President, Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, &c. and receive his Commissions and Instructions, without Loss of time. He will go to  Providence in the Stage and thence to  New York by Water and thence to  Philadelphia in the Stage. He will not sett out however untill he is inform'd of his Appointment.

Mr. Freeman the Son of our late  at  Milton and a Mr. Thorp of  New York were our Companions in the Stage. Mr. Freeman is a very agreable Man. I never travelled with any Man more assiduous to make me comfortable. At Church I met my Old Friends Governor Huntington and Lt. Governor Wolcot. Mr. Trumbull I have not yet Seen. He is confined with the Vapours. Mr. Speaker Trumbull is Senator for Six Years from next March. The Weather is to day as fine as possible. I hope the East Winds have brought in more Treasures from the Sea, and that my Farmers continue to Secure them.

No Senate yet. The President returned,all Submission in the Whiskey Counties. But a Force will be kept there to ensure their Obedience for some necessary time.  Antifederalism, Jacobinism and Rebellion are drooping their heads, very much discouraged. Clark of  N. Jersey and Comr. Gilson dead. Smith of  Carolina elected with great . Butler gone to  Charleston last Week unaccountably. &c. &c. &c. Bradley left out, for a Man of different Politicks. Langdon in danger. These are Symptoms.

Take great Care of your health which is  to me beyond all Calculation. The Fall of Robespierre, has a great Effect on the Public Mind. It has Startled and terrified many, whose Confidence in him was excessive.  "

The first night I went to a Mr. Alders, opposite to Mr. Binghams, but not liking the circumstance of living in an English Family an Upholsterer lately emigrated and not admiring the Rooms, I removed last night to  Francis's Hotel in  4th Street between  Market and  Chestnut Street. Here I Shall be at School with a Society of Patriotic Members of Congress who are all, virtuous Republicans. I Shall agree with them as Gentlemen, but shall claim the Right of a virtuous Republican, to differ from them in political Questions, whenever I may think them in the Wrong. Our Sensible and worthy Nephew Mr. William Cranch Spent the last Evening with me, and gave me a particular Account of the vast Projects of Mr. Greenleaf. His Saw mills in  Georgia, his Iron Works on  Hudson River, his forty or an hundred Houses building in the Federal City &c. &c. &c. But among the rest I was Sorry to hear of his Opening a Loan in  Holland though only at four Per Cent, to enable him to make Payment to his workmen. I am apt to Suspect Speculations upon Credit, tho sometimes they may be Successful. I however have always placed my Glory in Moderation, not having Spirit enough to undertake, of I have nor Understanding enough to conceive great Projects and Enterprises. My Lodgings are the most decent of any in Town that I know of, and my Accommodations are quite . Brisler has orders to send you Wheat and Rye Flour for a whole Year, but probably he will not ship it, till Ames returns from  Boston. With the flour I shall send Grass seeds for next Spring.

Such Abundance on shore, and all the Grass Land in Hancock's orchard covered with it. If Hancocks Meadow could have a covering it would be more grateful for it, than any other Land I have at present.  is anxious about Mr. Ames's Election and impatient to know the Decision: if he falls it will only be to rise the higher and the faster, for certainly a Man who has had so great a share in producing the present Prosperity of this Country cannot at his Years be neglected. The Supposition is too dishonourable both to Government and People. Both must be neither generous nor even selfish with common sense, to overlook so useful and honourable an Instrument, of their own fame and their own good. To choose in his Place at such a time as this a Man who has opposed and Obstructed that very Prosperity, and who would probably very often put it to a hazeard as far as his Vote would go, would be Such a Proof of Levity, Wantonness and Folly as I shall not believe till it is proved.

","My dearest Friend Since the Certainty has arrived of the very  Re election of our Friend Mr. Smith of  S. Carolina, the wiser Part of the Community have been the more anxious for that of Mr. Ames. The Orrery from  Boston, which arrived yesterday has excited great Expectations, that the District in which  Boston is placed, will not disgrace itself by disgracing Sound Principles and independent Conduct in that worthy Representative. Thursdays Post will relieve Us from all Uncertainty. Mr. Swanwick is announced to be elected instead of Mr. Fitsimmons, by a Small Majority, but it is said it will be a contested Election Still, and Swanwick may be, for any Thing that I know as federal as his Rival. The President told me that Mr. Finlay Said to him, at their Interview, that the Opposition of the People in the rebellious Counties of  Pennsylvania was not a Resistance to the Excise, or any other particular Measure of Government, but it was an universal Opposition to all Law and all Government. and all Magistrary. And that rather than go through such another Scaene as he had witnessed among them he should wish to quit the Scaene of Life. This Declaration from Finlay is as important as it is curious. If The French should be in Possession of  The Hague and the United Provinces, our Minister will not go there. His Credentials are to their High Mightinesses and His most Serene Highness, but if their Authority is annulled, either by Conquest or by a Change of Government, Mr. Adams will wait in  England for new Powers or further orders. I do not believe however that the French will be in  Holland nor the Government changed. The  and his Lady enquired kindly after your Health. Mr. Cranch I took with me on Sunday Evening and presented him to all the Family, where we drank Coffee and spent two Hours. He gave The President and Lady a par-
ticular Account of the present State of the  City of Washington. Miss Custis, Mr. Cranch says, is to be married to Mr. Peter of  George Town son of a rich Proprietor in the Federal City.  "
Nov. 13 1794,"My Dearest I have only time to say that I have not yet received a Line from you: but expect one . Dined yesterday at Mr. Morris's with Mr. Freir and his English Lady. Young Robert Morris was just arrived from  Europe, with Dispatches from Mr. Jay. All is going on well towards a final Settlement as is given out. I know very well however that it all amounts to no more, than was said and promised to me by Pitt, Carmarthen and the King himself.  ""Pay the Debts and the Posts shall be surrendered and the Negroes paid for."" They now Add  ""the illegal Depredations shall be compensated."" Fine weather. I send you an  for 1795. "
Nov. 14. 1794,"My Dearest Friend By the Post of Yesterday I received  your kind Letter of the 4th of this month , and, by it, was relieved from a great anxiety on Account of your health and that of Louisa. The News from the orchard is also very pleasant. I wish I could hear as good News from Hancocks Meadow. . But I leave all to your better Judgment.  No senate Yet. Mrs. Morris by her son has received  ""a Gallery of Fashion"" i.e., Prints of Ladies Dresses in all the Months of the Spring and Summer. The House goes on rapidly.- - - Speculation always ends in Extravagance. I love these People too well to be an uninterested Spectator, of what I fear is  not Wisdom. But it is indeed properly speaking as you'l say, none of my Business.  Mr. M. declines the Election as Senator. Tenche Cox or Fitzsimmons or Bingham will it is said be  [illegible] chosen. Our senate is under a Cloud. Two Members Frelingheusen and Ross are with the Army vs. the Rebels. Butler Bur and Bradley are absent.  knows why. Several are sick and there are several Vacancies &c. Col. Smith is in Town. He breakfasted with me two days ago and dined with me and the P.S. yesterday.  "

","My Dearest Friend My Vote I believe will never be again given for an Adjournment of Congress to an earlier Day, than that which is designated by the Constitution, because I find that Gentlemen cannot conveniently leave their Plantations and Professions in Season to be here sooner. A Fortnight has been already lost, and we have no Certainty of making a Senate on Monday. By the Papers that wrap Dumouriez Memoirs you will see, the drooping state of a silly and wicked Rebellion. Lee, assisted by Hamilton perhaps, appears with Dignity, Moderation and Decision. The  of Smith, Ames and Dexter is very exhilerating to the Friends of Peace, and equally mortifying to the unblushing Advocates of Confusion. I am more conveniently quartered than I ever was before, since my Family left this Town. "
"Phila  Nov. 17. 1794
","My dearest Friend Yesterday I attended the Dedication, of a Temple. The Presbyterian Congregation in  Market Street, have taken down their old Meeting House, and erected a new one, in the same Place, much larger, higher, more light, airy and elegant. They assembled in it for the first time, yesterday, when Dr. Ewing preached in the Morning and Dr. Blair in the Afternoon. I recollected with Pleasure upon this Occasion the Course of Sermons delivered in Rotation by the Ministers of  Boston in the new Church in  Brattle Street, and  Philadelphia got nothing by the Comparison. Dr. Blair however entertained Us with an elegant and sublime Discourse, in which among other good Things he gave Tom Paine a hearty Reprobation. I dined at Mrs. Otis's; all well. I hope to receive a Line , A Journal, or diurnal Register of farming would be very very refreshing, and entertaining. Oh the tedious solitude that awaits me, for 3 or 4 months, amidst the Strife, Smoke, Wealth, Luxury, Eloquence, Learning, Wit, and Wisdom of this proud City and our venerable Congress: To me, one Week of Domestic felicity and Rural Accomplishment, would be worth it all.  "
"Philadelphia  Nov. 18. 1794
","My Dearest Friend I had just sent off to the Post Office, my Letter in which I requested a Diary of Husbandry when I went to the Senate Chamber where I found  your Letter of the 10th , which contained the very Thing I had asked for, very accurate and pleasing. I hope for a continuance of it, for nothing refreshes me like it, in the dull Solitude to which I am destined for four months. A Senate was made , by the Arrival of Col. Burr, as fat as a Duck and as ruddy as a roost Cock. An hundred Thousand Pounds is a very wholesome Thing I believe, and I suppose my manifold Infirmities are owing to my Poverty. I know not whether fame lies, on this occasion, but she begins to whisper that Burr has been very fortunate and successful as well as several others of Govr. Clintens friends, by means that I will not explain till fame explains them more in detail. These simple Republicans are rewarded in this World for their Virtues, as well as admired for their Talents. Tomorrow We shall have the Speech, which is to be delivered in the House of Representatives as there is some doubt of the Solidity of the Building to hold a Crowd in the Senate Chamber. They have built us no , from which neglect some conclude that the Joi-disant friends of the People are afraid that the Senate will appear to the People better friends than them Selves. The Debate on Mr. Gallatin's Election seems to have abated the public Curiosity. Mrs. Cabot comes here, without Handmaiden or female Companion, in six Days by the Stage Coach and is as alert as if she had done nothing. I am glad you went to  Haverhil to see our unfortunate afflicted Sister, but am anxious about that paltry River, lest it should bring again your intermittent.  "
Nov. 19. 1794,"My Dearest Friend The Presidents Speech is so important to the Public that I know you will be anxious to see it as early as possible. When the Answers of the two Houses come to be debated we shall see whether there are any Apologists for Rebellion, in these Sanctuaries. As Mr. Edwards of  Kentucky appeared in Senate , We can do Business if one Member should be sick, but it will be very inconvenient to have so small a Majority. Mr. Potts of  Maryland and Mr. Taylor of  Virginia have resigned. The Senate seems really to be too small a Body for so important a Branch of the Legislature of so great a People. I feel, where I am, the want of the society of Mr. Otis's Family, but much more that of my own. I pore upon my Family at  Quincy, my Children in  Europe, and my Children and Grandchildren in  New York, till I am  and wish myself a private Man. That event however would not relieve me, for my Thoughts would be at  the Hague and at  N. York if I was with you at  Quincy. Your Meditations cannot be more chearful than mine and your Visit to our afflicted sister will not fear brighten your Views or soften your Anxiety. I hope we shall be Supported. But there is no Plan, that occurs to me that can relieve Us from our solicitude. We must repose ourselves upon those Principles in which we mere educated and which I hope We have never renounced nor relinquished. I would resign my Office and remain with you, or I would bring you next Winter with me but either of these Plans, the  out of the Question, would increase our Difficulties perhaps rather than lessen them. This Climate is Disease to me, and I greatly fear would be worse to you, in the present State of your Health. Mrs. Jay, poor Lady is more distressed than We are. I pray you to take Care of your Health and of Louisa's too. She is a good Girl: but I sometimes wish she would run about a little more if it was even to look at the young Men. "
"Philadelphia  November 23. 1794
","My dearest Friend It is a common observation of Old People, that as they advance in Life time appears to run off faster, and the years grow shorter. I cannot, I am sure, say the same of the time which has passed of late. I took Possession of this Chamber on the 8th. of this Month, and the time has seemed at least as long to me as any fifteen days of my whole Life. Tedious days and lonesome nights: I am weary of Ye!  is the Address of the Senate, and the Presidents Reply. You will be pleased with both, but wry faces and enough will be seen & heard in the House, the Cities, and in some Places in the Country. What do you make of the Intelligence from  France? They seem to be weary of , but as yet unable to do without them. The Explosion of their Powder Works and Men, seems as desperate as dreadful. Dreadful, Awful. Revenge, I expect will be practised in a thousand Ways: and as Revenge excites Revenge, when will it stop? They seem at present to be unable to confine their friends Ennemies, or to let them at Liberty. Sin and Death seem to have departed the Place where Milton saw them and taken their Abode in  Paris. I did not expect any Letter from you last Week, because of your Visit to  Haverhill: and I was not disappointed. But if I should not receive one this Week I shall be mortified. The Spirit in the two houses has hitherto appeared well disposed to support the Government: but whether the House will venture to censure a great Number of their Constituents, so freely as the President and Senate have done I know not. Mr. Madison and Mr. Scott upon the Committee would not admit the Clause into their Report, and whether The House will insert it is not yet certain. An Army of 15,000 militia so easily raised  to go upon such an Enterprize, ought to be a terrible Phenomenon to antifederal Citizens as well as to insolent Britains. Your old stepmother continues to provoke us, till our Patience is exhausted. She will soon see Mischief to her Dominions in  America. But they will cost Us infinitely more than they are worth.  "
"Philadelphia  Nov. 26. 1794
","My Dearest Friend The Pamphlet  may be called  ""The most astonishing Concentration of Jacobitical Malevolence that ever Scottish Spite exhibited."" have read it however with Interest and Avidity. It is not badly written. It has, no doubt, too much foundation in Truth. It has none little of the Wit and none of the humour of Tern Pain, but has more than his Malice and Revenge. It is sometimes amusing to contemplate sheer Malignity, especially when it seems not to have any Power to do harm. The Writer is a ""Callender"" now in this City employed as a Writer of Essays and Paragraphs for his Newspaper by Andrew Brown. We shall soon see the offspring of his Genius applied to Men and Measures in  America. Very soon will he be a Member of the Democratical society, as I foresee. This Country is to be the Asylum of all the discontented, turbulent, profligate and Desperate from all Parts of  Europe and Democratical societies are to raise them to fame, Popularity, Station and Power. How long the People will countenance this I know not. Jefferson it seems is to give the first Passport to these Incendiaries. Malignity seemed to have seized upon that Mans mind as deeply as upon Paines and Callenders. I expect a Letter tomorrow.  The President and Senate have fixed a Stigma on certain Anarchical societies. The House will do the same though perhaps in feebler terms. No Party No Man in either house has justified them. None has even excused them. Some have imprudently admitted their Legality. People have a right to meet and consider of Laws, express their opinions and feelings, for the Purpose of petitioning the Legislature for Repeals or Amendments. But it is not lawful to meet to frame and publish Curfews upon Laws, and Libels upon Men or Measures. If when assembled they do an unlawful Act Their Assembly is adjudged to unlawful from the Beginning. The Legality of the Meeting depends upon the Legality of their Conduct. It is incautious and improvident therefore to acknowledge their Legality, without Exceptions, Qualifications and limitations as some have done who are no friends to them. My Waggish Friend Fitch of  Jamaica applies to me from the Rolliad, or Probationary Odes.  "
"Phila  Dec. 1. 1794
","My Dearest Friend Your Letter of the 29th of Nov. gave me, in addition to the ordinary Satisfaction I receive from your Letters, the Pleasure of knowing that your Visit to  Haverhill, the damp  of whose River I dreaded, had not impaired your health. You ask me, if Dr. Tufts may be collecting Materials, this Winter for Building on the  Medford farm? I fear it will be a very costly Undertaking considering the Extravagant Prices of  every Thing, and it will keep me Streightened and poor for a long time. I expect the Expence of Building will be 300 , the Interest of which is Eighteen Pounds a Year near half the annual Rent of the whole Estate. I am willing to sell the whole for what it will fetch or to buy the whole at any reasonable Rate. But is it desired of me to build the whole though at my own Expence, when the half only of the Place is yours? I know however your tender and laudable Attachment to the Place, and will consent cheerfully to whatever you determine, or I will desire Dr. Tufts to consider me as his son, when he considers Sister Shaw as his Daughter, and do for Us both, as a father. We had last night and to Day another  storm which I hope has brought up a fresh Stock of Seaweed upon the Beach. Your Annals of Agriculture are more entertaining to me than political History or amorous Romance.  You will see the Address of the House and the Reply, cold, frozen, stiff, awkward Stuff. The Reply as an Echo to the Address is an admirable one, richly merited. The News from  Europe is enigmatical enough at present. The whole Theatre of  Europe has been taken up, for Years, with the Representation of a Tragedy of Errors. One knows not what is true, nor what is false: what is right not what is wrong. Suspense and  is all my Mind can rest on. One Truth however results from every fact and every Report, every certainty and every Supposition - our own indispensible Duty to preserve our Neutrality. The Members of Congress begin to see the Danger of receiving Foreigners with open Arms, and admitting them into our Legislatures so easily as we have done. The Western Insurgents are almost all Irish white Boys, and peep O Day Boys &c, imported and many of them sold since the Peace.  "

","My Dearest Friend I have received  your favour of Nov. 23 . Mr. Cooper, The Friend of our Diplomatic at  the Hague, I hear was very active in the Election of Mr. Ames. I wish that both Parties and all Parties may be convinced that some Qualification of Voters is necessary, but if Negroes and Sailors and Tapsters  as Oliver Cromwell used to call them are to vote for one why not for another? You have by this time the lively Address of the Senate and the lively Reply to it. You will soon have the dull Address of the House and the cold  Reply to it. If Fame says true Clinton cares little for Popularity: for The Miser has made himself immensely rich, and all his Friends and Tools besides. Mr. Cranch is main here. He has spent one Evening with me and taken one Breakfast. He is busy with Mr. Greenleaf, but in very good health. The Mania of Magnificence, is as bad as that of Avarice. King Hooper and  Lee, were all their Lives in such a Rivalry as Mrs. Morris and Mr. Bingham. Heaven preserve me from such a Judgment. Industry, Frugality, Moderation and Resignation are the only Qualities which can render human Life happy. To be first is the Charm as you say. But no more than one can be first - are all the rest to be miserable? Your Annals of Husbandry continue to delight me. Pray have the Yards and Styes all filled with Sea weed. There are 2 or 3 Loads of Manure at the sheep barn which ought to be carted up the Hill. Joys Manure must be sledded in Winter over the Meadows to our Corn field in the old Plain. The Manure made in the Stable and Barn at home, must be carted or sledded up the Hill before Spring. If Seaweed can be obtained, it is my design to cover the Mowing Ground opposite Eb. Pennimans as well as the Meadow by Cleverlys. I dont wish to lay out more work than our People can do but I only mention these Things to you that they may be kept in mind. Brisler will send you Flour as soon as any Vessell sails for Boston. Mr. Ceracchi has sent here a Present for you - a Medallion in Marble of my Head - as grave, as sad, as anxious, as severe, as the marble is hard, and the work fine. I  you his Card.   "
"Philadelphia  Decr. 5. 1794
","My Dearest Friend I returned, this Day the Visit of the ci-devant Duke De Liancourt. He is a sensible Man. He is a Cousin German of the late Duke de la Rochefaucault, and inherited his estate and for what I know his Titles: but neither  Estate nor Titles are of any Use at present. What will be, the future destiny of these high Personages is a curious Problem. I endeavoured to impress upon him as I have upon all other French men, the Necessity of an independent Senate in , incapable of being warped by Ministers of State on one hand or by popular Demagogues on the other. I begin now to entertain hopes of soon hearing from our Sons, to whom I have written by Mr. Greenleaf. This Session of Congress is the most innocent I ever knew. We have done no harm. The English are so beaten and the French so  that I wonder, there are not some Projects for War. But it seems Popularity is not now to be gotten by Spirit. I know not what to write to you, unless I tell you that I love you, and long to see you. But this will be no News. I wish I had a farm here. I would give you my Chronicles of Husbandry in return for yours. Three long months before I can see you. Oh! What to do with myself I know not. Brisler has this day shipped 2  of flour and the Medallion, by Ames. My Duty to My Mother and Love to Brothers and sisters and Cousins. Mr. Morris  of me the Character of William Cranch. Be sure I gave him a good one. How is Mr. Wiberts Health and Mr. Quincys?  "
"Philadelphia  December 7. 1794
","My dearest Friend Brisler has shipped, on board The Abby, Captain Eames, two  of Flour, one hundred Weight of Clover Seed and half a Bushell of Herds Grass Seeds; and the Medallion: all consigned to our Friend Mr. Smith in  Boston. As Captain Eames's Intention was to sail to day, I suppose he is gone. Twelve Pounds of Clover seed and two quarts at least of Herds grass seeds must be sown, when the time comes, to each Acre of Ground. The Weather is so mild and fine here that ploughing or any other Business may be done as well as in October. How it is with you I know not. The Times are very calm here at present and political societies are very silent. There is scarcely Animation enough in either house, to excite Attention. One may sleep in the midst of a Debate. I have not yet tried however. I want to mount my little horse and ride to  Penns Hill, or down to Uncle Quincys, but walking must answer for exercise till next March. Dr. Swing preaches to me every Sunday but I like Mr. Wibert as well. How does he do? I am more solitary than I was last Winter, but I can read. Writing is painful to my Eyes. I am afraid  will loose his Friend Steuben. He writes me that the Baron has been stricken with a Palsy, a Catastrophy naturally to be expected from his total neglect of Exercise. It is unaccountable that a Military Man, who must have used so much Exercise in some parts of his Life and have felt the Pleasure as well as the Salubrity of it, should be become so indolent in his old Age. But Men in solitude are apt to become inactive in proportion as they increase their gormandizing. There has been a great Mortality I think of late among our old patriotic Chiefs civil and military. The President wears the best of any of them that I have seen: and may he long continue his  of Body as well as Mind. Hamilton is certainly to resign and Knox is expected to go the same way. Wolcot is talked of for the Treasury and Pickering for the War Office with how much probability I know not. These resignations as well as that of Mr. Izard and Mr. Boudinot are not prosperous Omens. I fear that good Man will be worn out and wearied too often into Resignations. It is unpleasant Service how much soever it may be envied.  "
"Philadelphia  Decr. 8. 1794
","My Dearest Friend Your  of Nov. 30 , I received this morning. As every Thing conspires to keep me poor. I may as well give Way as not: So I will even agree to purchase Pratt Pew: But when I can send you Money to pay for it I know not. The Appropriation Bill is not passed and when it will be brought forward is uncertain. I will send to the Treasury however and see if I can get a quarter without it. If I cannot I will write you Word in a Post or two. As to Pratts parting with the Pew I believe there is little danger of his finding any other but me imprudent enough to go to his Price. Brisler has given fourteen Pence this Currency, about 11 of our Lawful Money per Pound for what he has sent by Eames, of Clover Seed, and  dollars for 1/2 Bushell of Herds Grass seed, but it is thought the Price will rise. The Senators and Representatives from  N. England come to see me oftener than they ever did when at Mr. Otis's or when I had a Family here, and We converse on a more familiar Footing: But I cannot bear this course of Life. I must get out of it, some way or other. The Whiskey Rebellion has rendered unpopular the Rant that was in vogue last Winter: but as  has its Revolution in these revolving Days It may become fashionable again. It seems that Dearborn and William Lyman are not chosen at the first  and I should guess they will not have a better Chance at the Second. The Situation of  Britain is fearful, as well as that of  Holland: nor is that of  France, notwithstanding their brillant Successes against their external  less ominous. But The Denouement, The Catastrophy of the whole vast plot is beyond the reach of my Comprehension or Conjecture. The Right of a nation to institute a Government is undeniable: But whether any nation will ever fairly institute a good one is yet a Problem. I fear that  France will be cheated into a bad one after all her struggles and sacrifices. I have written to our Sons. I dont flatter  with hearing very soon of their Arrival. Their Visit is made to  Europe in a very critical and a very interesting time. Every Faculty they have, must be excited by the terrors around them, and the Observations, Reflections and Conversation they may have, may be of the greatest service to them thro Life.  "

","My Dearest Friend Entre noun Mr. Sheerjashub Bourne called upon me the other Morning to ask me some Questions about Mr. Blacks farm and Captn. Beale's farm. He says both are to be sold. Beale asks ten thousand Dollars for his New House and farm - and the same for Squantum. Mr. Blacks asks Eighteen Thousand but it is supposed would take fifteen. I hope in mercy Bourn will not buy. Our present  are I believe much better. dont say any thing of this. Beale and Blacks are both impatient to be making Money in  Boston, and I dare say the Ladies had rather shine in the City. Mrs. Hancock it seems, thinks the Captn, of a Man of War as great a Man as a Governor or King. I dare say she will find him a greater. Do you remember a Dialogue of Ld. Littleton between The Princess of Orange and the Countess of flanrickard? I dare say she has no Idea of devoting herself to the Memory of a deceased Husband. Such Ideas are too Heroic and Romantic, for this enlightened Age. Mr. Cranch  with me, this morning. Tomorrow he goes off. I gave him a Letter to Mr. Carrol of  Carrolton.  "
"Philadelphia  Dec. 11. 1794
",My Dearest friend I have only time to  you an order on the Cashier of the office of Discount and Deposit for Six hundred Dollars and to assure you that I am as ever  
"Philadelphia  Decr. 14. 1794
","My Dearest friend I wrote you last Week and  an order for 600. Let me know when you receive it. Although the Weather is the most beautiful I ever knew in December, the Time seems longer to me, than ever any time did in  America. The Business of Congress  is Dulness, Flatness and Insipidity itself. Mr. Cranch went off, on  for  Washington as he intended to go to  Anapolis. I gave him a Letter to Mr. Carrol of  Carrolton. I have been much engaged in Reading the  of Muir, Margarot, Wat, Downie, and Walker. Mr. Walker of  Manchester appears to have been very ill used by the Church Party: but he was  acquitted. The others, I suppose could not be held guiltless, according to the Laws of  Scotland, and  England. The severity however of their Sentences may excite rather than suppress discontent and Mutiny. Selfcreated Societies, must be circumspect. It is very easy for them to transgress the Boundaries of Law, and as soon as they do they become unlawful assemblies, seditious Societies, mischievous Conventions, pernicious Associations, dangerous and destructive Combinations and as many such hard appellations as you choose to give them.  I take it for granted that political Clubbs must and ought to be lawful in every free Country. I belonged to several in my youth and I wish I could belong to one now. It would save me from Ennui, of an Evening, which now torments me as bad as the blue Devils would, if I had them, which by the Way I never had, and so cant say by Experience. Low Spirits and the blue Devils are not the same. I think I will read Swedenbourgs Works. I dare say they are as entertaining as The Pilgrims Progress or Robinson Crusoe or the Seven Champions.  that shows a strong and strange Imagination and is neither melancholly nor stark mad, is amuzing. I fear the Atheistical and Theistical Philosophers lately turned Politicians, will drive the common People into Receptacles of Visionaries, Enluminees, illuminees &c. &c. For the Common People will undoubtedly insist upon the Risque of being damned rather than give up the hope of being saved in a future State. The People will have a Life to come, and so will I. I sent you an History of  Geneva. "
"Philadelphia  December 16 1794
","My Dearest Friend I had flattered myself all the last Week with the Hope of a Letter on Monday: but when Yesterday came I found in the Door Keepers lodge of the senate, no Letter for me, though the Post was arrived, and the other Gentlemen had their Letters. Disappointed, mortified, sometimes half resentful, but more often anxious and Apprehensive that you were sick, I passed but an unpleasant Morning: after dinner  your Letter of the 6th  was brought to me in my Chamber, having been left with Mr. Francis, I know not why, by one of the Presidents servants. Callendars ""Political Progress, is a Part of a great System of Reform or Sedition, which made a great Noise in  Scotland, and has occasioned the transportation to  Botany Bay of Muir, Margarot, and Gerald; a sentence of High Treason against Wat and Downie, &c. &c. Self created Societies are setting all Mankind together by the Ears. They will not cease in other Countries till they are laid aside in  France, where they begin to be found inconvenient and to be thought dangerous. The popular Society of  Caen resolved,  ""We  Acknowledge none but you fox the Chiefs of the State: We own the national Representatives as the only point of rallying, and the People alone for sovereign. We swear to be always faithful to the Convention. We will regard as the Ennemy of the People every Man who would rouse, near near you, any Rival, insolent and usurping Authority."" Bache's Paper tells Us it is the Spirit of the times to support the constituted Authorities against all self created, usurping rival Pretensions. Whether the French or the Dutch are uppermost in  Holland our Sons have nothing to fear: I hope in a month or six Weeks we shall hear from them. Solus has it right. I want my Wife to hover over and about me. I hope Shaws Yard and Joys Yard, are or will be  with sea Weed as well as mine. The Business has gone on charmingly. Dont forget your Daily or Weekly Chronicles of Farming. As Dorothy has hitherto had only a peevish, fretful feeble Child for an Husband, I congratulate her on her opening Prospects of Advancement in the World, to the Arms of a generous, cheerful, good humoured, and able bodied Man. As the service of the People, according to modern Principles is no , Hopkintonianism in Politicks being the orthodox creed there can be no distinction between a Governor of a State and a Commander of a ship, except such as The Nerves confer. I suppose he has Property, which added to hers will make their old Age comfortable and that is enough. Literary Taste, intellectual Joys, Delicacy of the Sense of humour, and Reputation are about equal. I am not censorious. Not I. As Governors Wife, like her Husband, she has been an unprofitable servant and has no Merit. Why then should she have any Pride or Ambition? The Weather has been so fine, that I hope Eames has arrived with your Flour seeds and Medallion. I hope you will consent to request Ceracchi, to give that Image to Harvard or the .  "

","My Dearest Friend I have just received  your  of the 11th  and am surprised to see that you have been two Posts without a Letter. The Post Office must be in fault for I have written you every Week and frequently two or three times in a Week. I am and have been pretty well. I will send you the Books you ask for if I can find them. Mr. Denison, from  Nottingham in  England breakfasted with me this morning as well as Mr. Storer who lodges at the same house with me. Mr. Denison brought me Letter from Mr. B. Hollis who remembers you. The persecuted in  England fly from all Parts to our American Asylum. I am going to a female Commencement and will write you an Account of it. "
"Phila  Decr. 19 1794
","My Dearest Friend I promised you in my last an Account of the Commencement in the Methodists Meeting house north  fourth st. near  Vine street. But as a Bill which had some Allusions to the late Rebellion, and consequently interested the feelings of Parties, came on in Senate I could not get out of my Chair till three 0 Clock, and was therefore disappointed. I sent at once and bought the Books: but as I have made a free Use of the Post Office of late I must not send them too fast. I have read Lady Craven  and yesterday, with more Amusement than Edification. I shall stiffle myself with reading. The late Tryals in  Scotland and  England, have attracted my Attention very much. State Prosecutions of such Severity bode nothing good to  Britain. Eames with your Flour and my Letter with an order are arrived before this day I presume. The Weather has been Spring like and fair along time.  it rains most abundantly. We expect cold after it. Your last Letter had not one Word of Agriculture in it. I hope my broad Wheels are under Salt Water, and that Joys Yard and Shaws Yard are filled with Seaweed, and especially I hope that soft and Warm Beds are made of it for our swinish Multitude in all our Yards. Can you find the Portraits of the Kings and Queens of  England and  France in the  Ridelle? Look upon the White upon the Edges of the Serpent and the Urn.  "
Philadelphia  Decr. 23. 1794 ,"My Dearest Friend Monday, which is the pleasantest day of the Week, because it always brings me a Letter, produced me  your favour of the 12th . I am ready to purchase for you, the other half of the  Medford Farm, if it is to be sold, or to advance my  half for Building, if it is not. I think you are right not to sell. Keep it as a Remembrance. Paternal Acres are always good Land. What may be Hamilton's Views I know not: but I suppose he cannot live here, nor can any other, but in a Style altogether unsuitable to his Station. The Petulance of the People, will fatigue every Man out of his Life, if they continue to be goaded by Seditious Societies. The People will be compelled, either to dismiss their Congress or  their Clubbs. I dont mean to hang, or transport to  Botany Bay the Members of these Societies as the English and Scotch have done: nor to banish, imprison or hang as the Canton of  Berne has done: but to discountenance and discourage their assemblies. I have read the Jacobiniad. A Statesman must not be a , a Poet, nor a Wit. But a  ""Sad Man."" Your Farmers  refreshes me like a Cordial. The Weather here is still so spring like, that one almost forgets the Season We are in. It has been reported here that Mr. Fauchet is to be recalled, how truly I know not. They will never send a Man who will do them more  or better service. I dined yesterday with Thorning Shippen, and his pretty little Puppet of a Wife. The poor fellow is as pale and lean as a ghost. They have two little Boys. Mrs. Livingston was there. To return to Jacobinical societies. Is it not abominable to see a Crew headed by such an ignorant blundering, thicksculled Irishman as Blair McClenican, publishing their Manifestoes against the President and both Houses of Congress? I send you Bennetts strictures. Louisa's Book I will send as soon as I have read it.  "
"Phila  Christmas Day 1794
","My Dearest Friend This being one of the pleasant Days of the Week, Thursday the Post brought me  your kind Letter of the 16th . The News of The Alfred was written me the Day or next Morning of its Arrival in  Boston by our ever kind and attentive friends Dr. Welsh and Mr. Smith, and I should have instantly written it to you, with great Joy if I had not known, that you  must have had it, much sooner than I from the same Sources. Although there is a feeling of Disappointment, accompanies the Intelligence, arising from not having any direct Account of our sons, yet the high probability of the safe Arrival of the Ship, is a great Consolation. I congratulate you upon it, with cordial Sympathy, and join with you most sincerely in your devout Ejaculation for the health and safety of our sons. The Case mentioned in Brislers Letter contains the Marble Medallion, as brittle as it is elegant. The Weather is as beautiful, as mild, soft, clear and wholesome as can be imagined: but We had lately a  Wind and Rain, which I hope has threwn up, on the shores of  Quincy a fresh supply of Sea weed. I want to have the mowing ground opposite to Pennimans and Hardwicks upon  Pens hill covered with it, if possible. I am delighted with the Activity and Energy with which the affairs of the farm have been conducted, since I left you. A few years of such Exertions will make the Place productive of most of the Necessaries of Life for Us and I hope We shall be indulged with the quiet Enjoyment of it for as many Years as We can be useful to our Country, our Friends or ourselves. I have been to Church at Dr. Ewings and heard a good sermon. Mrs. Otis and Miss Betcy are well. The News of my Mothers Health and Activity is in a high degree delightful to me. My Duty to her.  is a Book, a present for Louisa. A pretty Book it is, a good Book. I have very little fault to find with it, of any kind. His opinion of Grecian Taste in Art and Literature are so exactly like my own, that he makes me regret, deeply regret,, that the avocations of my Life, have not permitted me, to pursue it with so much Attention as I always desired: but still more than I have not had Opportunity to impress it upon my sons, as I ought. They have better opportunities and Means than I had.  "
"Philadelphia  Decr. 28. 1794
","My Dearest Friend I went on  night with Mr. Storer to the Drawing Rooms where the warmth of the weather increased by a great fire and a Croud of good Company, gave me one of my annual great Colds. The same Evening the large Lutheran Church in our old Neighbourhood took fire and was burnt down. The next morning, Mrs. Otis was brought to bed and the Mother and the Daughter are very well. So much for News good and bad. The Weather continues very moderate: but the old Adage a green Christmas makes a growing Church Yard, or a fat Church Yard as the various readings have it, is a damper to its Pleasures. Our Country is not yet sufficiently drained, for these warm Winters. Cold Weather is necessary to confine, or kill the putrid deleterious , which arise from uncultivated forests and undrained Marbles. Parson Osgoods Sermon makes a great Noise here. -- What says The Governor to his share of the Whipping? The Clergy of  New England have  Paine and Robespierre till they begin to tremble for the Consequences of their own Imprudence. Did Mr. Wibirt in complaisance to the Proclamation omit the national Government? Old Men say that time  faster and faster every year. If I concur in this observation it must be when I am at  Quincy. Here my moments are long and slow. I read my Eyes out, and cant read half enough neither. The more one reads the more one sees We have to read. An horrid Journey of 3 or 400 miles before I can get home lies before me like a mountain. Charles has lost his Friend Steuben. I have written to him a great many Letters: but I can get only a line in answer. At one time he says he has a willow on his Finger. At another he is very busy. This is good news. I have invited him to come and spend a Week with me in January if his Business will allow. I have bought the  of the Scotch Jacobins, and sent them to him as Presents. They are in the Way of his Profession and will be both Entertainment and Information to him. Self Created societies in  Switzerland,  England and  Scotland, dont come off with a gentle rap over the knuckles in a Speech or a sermon: but they promote their Members to the Cord or to  Botany Bay, to Banishment, Transportation or Death. The mildness of our Government is a pleasing delightful Characteristic: and although it will probably give Encouragement to some Disorders, and even some daring Crimes, it is too prescious to be relinquished without an absolute Necessity. Have  with you as often as possible and tell her I hope to see her again in two months.  "
"Philadelphia  Decr. 30. 1794
","My Dearest Friend Your  of 24th  marked by the Post Office 22d of Decr. I received yesterday. Mr. Osgoods Sermon was plenty here. I received one from  Boston before. The Clergy I think ought to pray for the national Government. If our Dissenting Ministers will not at  Quincy I will go to Church, where a form is prescribed by Authority which even Mr. Cleverly complies with. Within a Day or two after your last I presume you received an order for 600, which will enable you to repay what you have borrowed. Mrs. Washington, Mrs. Cabot and Mr. Cabot desire me to send you their Regards &c. Not one Word about the Farm in this last Letter, a fatal omission. Tell Joy I  hope to see my Cattle fat, though he works them hard. Now come great Things. Knox is to go out tomorrow. He insists on beginning the Year 1795 a freeman. He told me Yesterday, he had been 20 Years (next April) in service, that if he should die tomorrow his Wife and Children would not have enough to live on two years. That he had not above ten years to live, that he had the means at the Eastward of making something and that it was his Duty to do it. This Man is capable of flattering himself with hopes that to others appear Chimerical. But He is capable of thinking himself popular enough in  Massachusetts to be chosen Governor at the first Vacancy. But I suspect he cherishes another hope, that is of being Governor of  Maine. These however are hints between you and me and to go no farther. Another Gentleman Yesterday let me read in his Heart without suspecting it. Mr. Cabot told me, he thought he should not come again to Senate. Mrs. Cabot was averse to coming this time. He had Difficulty to persuade her. He thought she would not come again and if she declined he would not come without her. You know my opinion of the Motive of his removal to  Brooklyne. His Resignation will be in pursuance of the same Views. But I cannot help thinking he will be disappointed. I know of no Man, who would make a better Governor, at least among all those who are likely to obtain the Place. But his services have not been known enough to the People to sink into their hearts. His fortune is not splendid enough to dazzle: and he is not at the head of any interested Bank or Company whose Exertions can bring him in. I  these ambitious Men: By joining with Gill he might be chosen Lt. Govr. for ot. I know. But the Man the most to be pitied is the President. With his Exertions, anxieties, Responsibilities for twenty years without fee or reward or Children to enjoy his Renown, to be the Butt of the Insolence of Genets and  is a Tryal too great for human Nature to be exposed to. Like The Starling he cant get out of his Cage but Knox says and I believe it, he is sick very sick in it. I could tell you a great deal more but this must be reserved for a Tete a Tete.   "

","My Dearest Friend I wish you a happy New Year, and a Repetition of happy New Years as long as Time shall endure: not here below, because I shall want you in another Country, better than this. What do you say? Shall I keep a national Thanksgiving with you? I hope before that Day We shall have good News from all our Family,  We cannot be all together. Compliments of the Season to  and all my good friends. Dont forget my farm next time you write. I hope to find a Letter at the Senate Chamber. "
Jan 4. 1794 (i.e. 1795),"My Dearest Friend The Weather has been dull and unpleasant for several Days. We had last night a light snow and this morning a Rain; so that Winter does but play with Us Yet. I promised Mrs. Washington and Mr. and Mrs. Cabot to present you their Compliments.  has resigned and Cola Pickering is appointed to his Place. The House have been debating about Titles these 3 or 4 days. Insurgents in all Ages have an invincible Antipathy to Titles. They will not even be called Citizen or Gaffer and Gammer nor Mr. nor Mrs. What a Sweet  had the Insurgents in the Reign of Richard the Second. Sir John Gower who wrote a poetical History of that Commotion has wonderfully represented their Aversion to Titles in the following lines, which,Dr. Tufts, Uncle Quincy, Mr. Wibert, Mr. Briggs, or Mr. Cranch to all of whom present from me the Compliments of the Season, may explain to you, if they want Explanation. Watte vocat, cui Thome venit, neque Symme retardat, Billeque, Gibbe, Simul Hykke, venire jubent. Colle furit, quem Gibbe juvat nocumenta parantes, Cum quibus ad damnum Wille coire vovit. Grippe rapit, dum Daive Strepit, comes est quibus Hobbe Lorkin, et in medio non minor esse putat. Hudde ferit quos Judde terit, diem Tibbe juvatur Jakke domos que viros vellit, et ense necat &c. &c. Thus you see that Chaises Rebels, Bradfords Rebels and Wat Tylers Rebels, were all equally unornamented and uncorrupted with Titles. Watte, Tommy,Symony, Bitty, Gibbe, Hykke, Colle, Bille, Grippe, Davy, Hobby, Huddy, Judde,Jakke, Tibbe, were all the Rank and Distinction and subordination they required. I have one of my great Colds, having escaped it, a month I was in hopes, to have escaped it for the Winter: but it has overtaken me.  writes me that you were getting  up from a Fever, which has given me great Paine. You say nothing only that you had not been very well. We must continue to live together. The southern States contrive to give the Old Gentleman so much trouble that I fear he will resign. If he resigns I must, and then I shall live at home. Dont mention this however because it will spread too great an alarm and it may be without foundation.  "

","My Dearest Friend By this Days Post I have your Letter of the 26 Ult. I believe that some incomprehensible Sympathy or other, made me low spirited all the time you were sick,  I neither knew nor suspected it. I rejoice to be informed of your Recovery. If I were not afraid of every Change in your Situation, that might endanger your health, I would plan a Project for next Winter: but I must leave that for a T te a T te. To a heart that loves Praise so well and receives so little of it your Letter is like Daudanum which Mr. Henry  says is the Divinity itself. The French Convention has passed a Number of Resolutions for the Regulation of Jacobinical  or Self Created Societies, founded in eternal Reason, perpetual Policy, and perfect Justice, which every other Nation must adopt, or be over thrown. I wish Mr. Osgood and every other Minister would preach a sermon once a Quarter expressly on that Text. Affiliations, Combinations, Correspondences, Corporate Acts of such societies must be prohibited. A Snake with one head at each End, crawling opposite Ways must split the snake in two unless one head is so much stronger than the other as to drag it along, over thorns and stones till it looses it headship. So the King of Frances Constitution Acted. A Man drawn between two Horses is a neat image of a Nation drawn between its Government, and self Created societies Acting as Corporations and combining together. Hay for the Horses I know you must purchase and I always expected it. Buy the best and enough of it. The Weather is here this Day as fine as you describe the day before Christmas when our Friends were so good as to visit you. Bright, clear, mild. Farmers  every Where. Letters from  Connecticut say the Cankerworm Millers and Sluggs are going up the Appletrees. Tar our Trees in the Garden and see if you catch any. There is an unusual calm and dearth of News at present. Most important Events are expected to be imported by the first . I am myself much inclined to doubt whether the French will get to  Amsterdam. There are Obstacles in their Way very serious, and which may be made invincible. Amsterdam may be defended by an Inundation. Even without an Inundation it is capable of a good  -- a strong Wall, a Wide deep Ditch, a numerous Artillery -- and I am not willing to believe that the People are asleep or will be idle.  I am, with the tenderest of all sentiments ever yours,  "

","My Dearest Friend The Travelling I suppose has retarded the Post of this Week, till , when I received your two  Letters of the 4th  and  8th . I am happy  in the Company of our Charles, who arrived at my Invitation from  New York as fat as a Squab or Duck. Mr. Burr says he is a Steady Man of Business. He is gone to the Drawing Room and Play. A Debate in Senate disappointed me of the female Commencement. Fenno has sent Mr. Cranch his Paper from the 1st of Jan. Mr. Bowdoins Morality is the same with that of the Livingston Family at  New York, and of all other Men who have more Ambition than Principle. I have gone through a Life of almost three Score Years, and how few have I found whose Principles could hold against their Passions, whose  could contend with their Interests, or even whose Pride could contend struggle with their Vanity. May I never have to reproach myself with faults which I have seen so often with Grief, shame, and Indignation in others. I know not that ever in my Life I gave a Vote against my Judgment. May I never deprive myself of the Power of saying this to my Wife and to my God in my last hour: I wonder that many of my Votes have not sent me home but here I am after a series of trying Years. Four and thirty Years, the most of my Thoughts ahd Anxieties have been for the Public. Twenty Years have been wholly devoted to public Employment. My forces of Mind and Body are nearly spent. Few Years remain for me, if any. In public Life probably fewer still, If I could leave my Country in greater Security, I should retire with Pleasure. But a great cloud hangs over it yet. I mean a Cloud of Ignorance, Knavery and Folly. Whether a torrent can be stemm'd or not is yet uncertain. My Hopes however are stronger than my fears, and I am determined to be as happy as I can. My head is not turn'd I hope, though my Paper is.  is not yetabed. She is well however. Mrs. Otis and her sister are well and the little Girls too. Don't say a Word of my coming home: but I hope to keep Thanksgiving with you. It is however uncertain. Perhaps Congress may rise perhaps not. I must put Brisler and  into our House next Winter, Louisa to board at Mr. Cranches. I will pay with Pleasure for her, and take you along with me. What say you to this Project? The greatest difficulty will be to find Lodgings. May every Blessing and you and yours  "

Said ""it was a justification of the Propriety of his Appointment, a Presage of his future Usefulness: and well digested, well arranged and well connected."" A handsome Compliment. In this Letter he says  had shewn him the whole Negotiation with Britain. He speaks very modestly and respectfully. I may not repeat any Thing: but I learn from this Letter that there is not only a Possibility but some Probability that Mr. Jay or at least the Result of his Negotiations may be here by the fourth of March. If so I ought to be here too, which willderange my Plan of spending thanksgiving with you.

","My Dearest Friend I received  your  of the 9th  Yesterday. The Weather is now extream Cold. The River is frozen and a snow covers the Ground. If the Season is as sharp and at the same time so fine with you, it will present a good Opportunity to cross the  Mill Pond. It was judicious Advice and a prudent determination to  your Wood this Winter from the Mountain: and I hope you will pursue your Plan of preparing a sufficient Store for the Year. I am ""gallant"" enough to think the time tedious, till I can begin my Journey home, and I shall think it all the Way tedious till I get home: But I am afraid I have flattered  prematurely with the pleasing hope of seeing you by the 19th of February. There is so general and so great Expectation of important Matter for the senate from Mr. Jay, before the 4th of March, that, I have some doubts whether I ought not to stay, though my own Opinion is not sanguine that We shall have any Dispatches so soon. What is to be the Fortune of , I know not. I am anxious about him and his Family. He has been raised to an Elevation, for which neither Nature, nor Education ever intended him. Fortune alone has been his Patron. His Family has been worse calculated for his situation than himself. He has been a laborious and I doubt not a faithful servant of the Public, and it would be  to see him unfortunate in his old Age. I wish his Lands may prove a source of Abundance to him and his Family. Hamilton will do better. He is younger and has more Economy. It is said he refuses all public Employment and goes resolutely to the Bar at  New York. He refused to stand Candidate for Governor. Mr. Morris has resigned. Mr. Bard has resigned: and I dont know but all the best Men will resign. The Government will fall for Want of Men to hold it up.  drank Tea with Col Hamilton last Evening and dines with him to Day.

I am glad to hear that at length after 5 or 6 Years meditation you have made your Visit to Mrs. Miller and Mrs. Vezey. I am afraid you did not at last carry Madam Apthorp to those places, as you ought to have done. We have had severe cold for a few Days: but it has since moderated and carried off the snow. Winter never Seems to be in earnest, when it comes so late.  returnd yesterday to  New York, and left me, more solitary, than he found me. I know not what Resolution to take about coming home. I fear, it will be expected of me that I stay till 4 March, waiting for Mr. Jays Dispatches and his Treaty -- not that I believe they will arrive so soon.  Not that I can have any Voice in the Question for two thirds decidedly ofCongress the senate must agree. Not that one Member, will be in the least influenced by any Opinion of mine. Not that I can give any Information in the Affair to the most ignorant. But it will be expected, that I stay. Tout est dit, i.e. Although every Body else do as they please and go and come when they will, I alone must be chained to the Oars. I shall keep a triste Thanksgiving in  Philadelphia. The Second Week in March is moreover the Worst moment in the Year to travel. I shall be carted again or rather drawn in a Coach by Oxenas I was horsed ferry to  New Haven, part of the Way, which is more ridiculous. But have been horse carted from  Leostoff in England fifteen miles and Boors waggoned fifty miles, from  Gorce,  Overflackee and  Helvoet to the Brille; and have been mule carried and walked on foot over the  Mountains in Spain -- and after that nothing can come amiss. The more a Man submits to be a slave the more he may. I wish I had an exact account of all the Voyages I have made between  Harwich and  Helvoet, and between  Calais and  Dover. The Voyage from  New York to Providence last summer and from  New Haven to  New York last fall. Did ever any Man make so many uncomfortable Journeys and Voyages? They have been enough to kill any other Man for what I know certainly most other Men. But a kind laving grateful Country, is a sweet and ample Reward for all these Sufferings and services.

His friendly Attention to me, when Congress held their Sessions at  York Town, I can never forget, and excites a more lively Interest in his Loss than that of some others who have lately gone before him. Mr. King is re-elected by the Legislature of  New York by a majority of five in the House and two in the Senate, in opposition to Mr. Tillotson, whom you know, to have married a sister of Chancellor Livingstone. This is a great Point . , Chancellor Livingstone, Mr. Burr, Mr. Yates and Mr. Hamilton, are mentioned as Successors to Gov. Clinton who has resigned. Mr. Jay, if he should not return, will not run very last. Mr. Hamilton it is said will not serve. Chancellor will stand no Chance as I hear, and it is doubted whether Burr or Yates will prevail. We are still at Uncertainties whether  or Despatches from him will arrive before the 4th of March, which makes me still dubious whether it will be right for me to go away. I am most earnestly and ardently desirous of it but will it do? Mrs. Washington is very happy at present in a Visit from her two Granddaughters, Nelly's sisters as I suppose they are. One of them is a fine blooming, rosy Girl, who I dare say has had more Liberty and Exercise than Nelly. I dined yesterday at Mr. Morris's whose Hospitality is always . A Company of venerable old Rakes of Us three score Years of Age, or a little over or a little Under sat smooking segars, drinking burgundy and Madeira and talking Politicks till almost Eleven O Clock.

","My dearest Friend This Morning I received  your  of the 21st of January . I am sure your People do a great deal of Work, so dont be concern'd. I am very well satisfied with your Agricultural Diary. The venerable .Governor made the best Speech he ever made, but the old Leaven ferments a little in it. I wonder you had not received two Letters from  which I inclosed to you. I now inclose you one from Mr. Jay, which shews that our sons were arrived in  Holland and had passed through their Ceremonies at the  Hague and gone to Amsterdam, to look as I suppose after the imprudent Van Stophorst, and American Money in his Hands. The  Postscript to Dunlop will shew you, that the expectation of a Treaty, hourly to arrive, will not allow me to leave my Chair   till the fourth of March. I shall be charged with deserting the President, forsaking the secretary of State, betraying my friend Jay, abandoning my Post and sacrificing my Country to a weak Attachment to a Woman and a weaker fondness for my farm, if I quit at this Moment. So be thou thankful alone, that thou hast a good Husband here, that thy Children are safe and in Honour in  Europe, and that thy Daughter has given thee a fine Granddaughter; besides innumerable Blessings to thy Country. I will be thankful and joyous here all alone. We momently expect the Treaty: but it may not arrive this month. When it does I expect to see wry faces as well as smiling ones. Perhaps much Debate may take Place. Let Us know what it is first however before We oppose, or  or applaud or approve. Your son  says it is better than War -- that is all I know about it. Keep all the Letters relating to .  "

","My dearest Friend The Judges are now here. Judge Cushing is under the Hands of Dr. Tate who is said to have wrought many Cures of Cancers and particularly one for the President. The Judge appears to be under serious apprehensions for something in his Lip which he thinks is a Cancer but his hopes from Tates Prescriptions seem to be lively. Mrs. Washington is happy in the Company of her three Grand daughters, the Eldest Patty and youngest Nelly whom you know are unmarried. The  middle one is lately married to Mr. Peters of  George Town the son of a rich Gentleman of that Place. They are all three fine Women. I have been since  very unhappy on Account of Nabby: she sent to an Apothecary for some Magnesia, and took it: but the negligent Wretch had sent her, something which operated as a violent Emetic, which in her weak State must be very disagreable. Although she was better when my Letter from Charles of the 5th was dated, I am impatient for the Post to arrive and bring me a further Account of her Condition.  Treaty is not arrived, and I must wait till it does. A Battle Royal I expect at its Ratification, and snarling enough afterwards. I admire the French Wit and Ingenuity of a Toast this Morning in Baches Paper. ""Pickegne, Jourdan and Jay."" It snows plentifully at present. I hope in your Letter which I expect to find at the Senate Chamber  you have acknowledged the Receipt of two Letters from Thomas in  London. The Boys have been fortunate hitherto and I pray that they may be so through Life, and be made useful Men. Their Country will want Men of Education acquainted with foreign Languages, Manners, Laws and Usages. My Duty to my Mother and Love to all. "
"Phil.  Feb. 10. 1795
","My dearest Friend I was not disappointed Yesterday, for the Post brought me your Letter of January  and I was relieved from an heavy Burthen of anxiety on Account of Nabby by a Letter from Charles assuring me that she was much better and thought to be out of Danger. Your Gratitude for the kind Protection of Providence to your Family is as natural as it is pious. Few Families have oftener been at hazard, and fewer still have been so uniformly blessed with Protection, safety and Success. To look back and recollect the Adventures of myself and my Wife and Daughter and sons, I see a kind of Romance, which, a little Embellished with Fiction or Exageration or only poetical ornament, would equal any Thing in the Days of Chivalry or Knight Errantry. Your Farmers Register is very satisfactory. It is a great deal of Work to take Care of such Stocks of Cattle and a great Quantity of other service cannot be expected of Joy and Shaw, who have no Boys. I hope, our  makes James and Prince assist him. I am sure they ought. The  Slip will shew you that Poor Jay has a fiery Ordeal to go through. His Treaty dont arrive and I will not wait for it beyond the fourth of March. When I negotiated Treaties I sent Copies by five ships -- or rather five Originals for I had so many executed. I am very much afraid of this Treaty but this is in Confidence.  "

Phila. Feb. 15th 1795
","My Dearest Friend This is the coldest day We have felt this Winter, and if it were not for the hope I have of a Letter from you Tomorrow, I should freeze for what I know, to night. This Month has been all unpleasant Weather, but none severe. You have had a North East storm I perceive which raised the Tides and I hope brought in a fresh and abundant supply of Seaweed. It is the dullest time We have seen this Winter. No Arrivals no News from abroad, nor from any Part of our own Country. The Treaty appears not and when it will, no Man can tell. Are We to wait here till May for It? I wont. There is not the smallest reason for my waiting. I can, in no possible Case have any Voice in its Ratification as two thirds of the Senators must agree. Nor will any opinion or Reasoning of mine have the smallest Weight with any one of the Senators.  If I were disposed to -- wait how long must I wait? I am tired of reading and writing: My Eyes complain: I want Exercise: I must have my Horse: and I must be at home. Charles writes me that Nabby has got the better of her unfortunate Accident and is out of all Danger. I rejoice and am thankful. We know not what to do with our Trunks and Flour and Porter &c. &c. There is no  here for  Boston. We must store them and leave them with some faithfull hand to be sent to  Boston by the first Vessell. You say I must stay a few Days at  New York. But I shall be uneasy and impatient. No Business, No Books, no Amusement, No Society much suited to my Taste. Good Cheer is not enough for me. Balls, Assemblies, Hunting, are neither Business, Pleasure nor Diversion for me. What do you say shall I resign my Office when I am threescore, or will you come with me in a stage.  and lodge at a Tavern in fourth street? I must contrive something new against next Winter. The old Routine grows too insipid! I shall never be weary of my old Wife however.  So declares your Affectionate Husband  "

","My dearest Friend Through the finest Fields of Wheat, Rye, Barley, Oats and Clover, but very indifferent Roads We arrived on Saturday all well. The Senators to the Number of five or six and twenty are in Town and will meet in this Chamber at Eleven 0 Clock. I can form no Judgment how long We shall . I congratulate you and all good People on the  decision of the Elections in  New York, which indicates a Change of sentiment very desirable in that State, and of great Importance to the Union. We are told that Adel is arrived and De Letombe and that Dudley Rider is to take the Place of Hammond. The State of Things in  Paris arising from  Scarcity and from Party is gloomy, but the Particulars you will see in the Papers. Mr. Swan was in my old  but has very politely offered me the saloon as usual. He is thought here to have made a great Fortune and to be a very important Man. It is said he has been the most successfull of any Man in getting his Vessells to Port. The Want of Bread in  France and  England will raise flour to 20 Dollars a  -- it is now 15.  "

","My dearest Friend The Senate assembled Yesterday at 11, twenty five Members present. The new Senators were sworn, and a Committee waited on the President who immediately sent a Message with The Treaty, which was read together with Part of a Volume of Negotiations which accompanied it. Mr. Butler and Mr. Gren arrived last night as I hear so that We shall be very full. I can form no Conjecture, of the time when the Senate will adjourn. The President, and Lady and Miss Nelly make many kind Enquiries concerning You and Mrs. Smith and Louisa &c. &c. Your Curiosity I doubt not is all alive. But Mum -- Mum -- Mum. Inclosed is a  Poem for your Amusement. "

","My Dearest Friend The Senate are now in Possession of the Budget. It is a Bone to gnaw for The Aristocrats as well as the Democrats; And while I am employed in attending the Digestion if it, I send you enclosed an Amusement which resembles it only in name. I can form no Judgment when the  will be over. We must wait with Patience. I dined yesterday in the Family Way with The President. He told me that the American Minister, at the  Hague, had been very regular and intelligent in his Correspondence. The whole Family made the usual Inquiries concerning You and sent you the usual Compliments. Be very , my dearest Friend, of what you say, in that Circle and City. The Times are perilous. "

","My Dearest Friend If I could take a Walk or a Ride to   in the Evening and come here again in the Morning how clever it would be: I am somewhat disappointed in not having received a Line from you since I left you. You are not sick I hope. Mr. Jay spent last Evening with me and let me into the History of the Treaty and Negotiation, explaining his Views of its intent and operation. I can say nothing upon it at present. I have read 8 of Mr. A's Dispatches and 14 remain to be read. Govt is much pleased with them. The Newspapers give you all the Public News. "

","My Dearest Friend I have received yours of the 10th and a Cordial it was, for I began to be fearful for your health. Louisa is a good Girl for writing such comfortable Accounts from home. I believe the Farm looks well. I am grieved for my Dear Johnny. He must go home with Us for northern Air. My Love to all. When I shall get away from the City is uncertain: but I have no hopes of being excused before the End of next Week. The Treaty is of great Extent and Importance and will not be rejected nor adopted without a thorough Examination. I presume every Member will wish for such an Investigation as will enable him to render a Reason for his Vote whether Pro or Con. "

",My dearest friend I have only time to say that I am well. That Mr. Paine has arrived and Mr. Vining will be here  when the Senate will be full. I have no hopes of the Senates rising before next Saturday -- if the Business is sooner finished I shall be pleasantly disappointed. Mrs. Washington desires to be most Affectionately remembered to you. After 3 days rain We are now in hopes of fair Weather.  Love to all.

","My dearest Friend It is  to feel an Impulse to write when                         there is nothing to say. I write merely to let you know that I am alive and not                         sick. The Weather has been cold for several days which is more tolerable at                         least to me, than the heat which We suffered for a day or two the Beginning of                         the Week past. The new French Minister is arrived. Whether he has any Budget to disclose                         has not yet appeared. Mr. Jay is in fine Spirits and his health improves. I                         should suppose he will remain here till the Fate of his Treaty is determined,                         which We hope, with some doubt however, will happen before the End of this                         Week. 29 Senators attended Yesterday and the 30th is expected tomorrow. We                         shall meet for the future at an earlier hour in the Morning. The Deliberations                         have been temperate, grave, decent, and wise, hitherto and the Results                         judicious. I have received but one Letter from you. I am anxious to hear further from                         Johnny Smith: whether he is better or not. My Absence from home at this season would be less distressing or rather less                         insipid, if my Presence here was  more necessary, or indeed of any                         Utility: but to the Mortification of Seperation                         from my family and affairs at a time when they would be most                         agreable to me, is added the Consciousness that I                         can do notno good to others any more than to myself. I                         have no Voice, and although the fate of the Treaty will not be, justly                         imputable to me in any degree, yet there is reason to expect that many will                         suspect me, and other charge me, with a greater share of it that would belong                         to me if I had a Voice. All these Things terrify me little. A Mr. Millar, a son of a Professor Millar                         of                          Glasgow known by his ""Historical View of the English Government""                         last night brought me a Letter of Introduction and Recommendation from                         Dr. , who                         desires his ""Sincere Respects to every Part of my Family."" ""In the Midst of the                         Desolations of                          Europe, he rejoices in the Prosperity of                          America and in the Wisdom and Moderation of its two chief                         Governors."" So much for Compliment. Moderation however is approved only by the Moderate who are commonly but a                         few. The many commonly delight in something more piquant and lively.                           I am with desires rather immoderate to be going home with you, yours                             forever  Yesterday I dined at Mr. Binghams with a large Company.                         While at Table a servant came to me with a Message from Mr.                             Law who desired to speak with me in the Antichamber. I went out to him                         and found that he wanted to  of me concerning                         a young Lady of amiable manners and elegant Education whom Mr.                             Law and Mr. Greenleaf had found in                          Maryland in great distress and a little disarranged and brought                         with them to                          Philadelphia. She is connected with the Families of                         Col. Orne and Col. Lee of                          Marblehead. I knew nothing of her. Governor                             Bradford says she has been some Weeks in                          Rhode Island. I sent Mr. Law to Mr.                             Cabot. Mr. Brown came in yesterday. He Keeps with all the Horses                         at The Rising Sun, between the 5th and 5th mile stone in the Country, at                         Mr. John Dovers. His Horses are in fine order. But I shall not                         be in a Condition to Use them this Week I fear.  "

","My Dearest Friend I have not heard a Word of the Medallion. But at Dinner at Mr. Binghams he said that Mr.  was embarked for  Hamborough: but that he had taken very unwarrantable Methods to get Money, for he had drawn upon The President, Col. Hamilton and Mr. Jefferson for 1500 Dollars each for the Busts he had made for them. I asked if they had paid him. He said He did not know what the others had done: but the President had not. He said He asked Mr. Talleyrand the Price of a Bust, who told him the highest Price of Hendon and the first artists in Paris was 50 Guineas. This is between you and me. Dont mention it. The Senators now talk of rising next Week. I see no Reason for sitting over this: but must wait the appointed time. I am afraid We shall not get away till July. Still hope for better Things. I write You a Memorandum of my  every day: but have received only one Letter from you. "
"Philadelphia  June 17. 1795
","My Dearest Friend I received Yesterday your  of the 15th. The Discussions upon the Treaty have been temperate, grave and decent, as least as much so as any Debate that was ever carried on in Senate. The Subject will be thoroughly examined and fully understood, before any Decision is made. I think We shall rise by the last of next Week perhaps sooner: but all is uncertain. Mrs. W. says John Ague arises from Worms and that you should give him Pinkroot, I think it is that she says will cure him. The Dispatches from The  Hague have not been laid before Senate. I wish they had -- but there has been no occasion. G. A.s Speech is a good one upon the whole -- a little seasoned as you say, to make it popular with a certain Party, to whom he too often sacrifices. "

","My Dearest Friend Mr. Adet was presented to The President on Tuesday and accompanied by The Secretary of State made me a Visit immediately after his Audience. I was not at Home but in Senate. On Wednesday Morning I returned his Visit at Oellers Hotel. He is about the Size of Mr. Shaw, Charitys Husband and looks a little like him: not quite so rosy  He is not a Friend to  -- announced to The President the entire annihilation of Factions in  France, &c. His Excellency Governor Jay returned Yesterday to  . He has been very sociable and in fine Spirit. His Health is improving. We have no C.J. as yet nominated. It is happy that Mr. J. Election was over before the Treaty was published: for the Parties against him would have quarrelled with the Treaty right or wrong that they might give a Colour to their Anomosity against him. Some Think We shall rise this Week: but I fear We shall be obliged to  some days next Week.  I hope We shall not have many of these supernumerary sessions. One of our Senators Yesterday, Mr. Ross of   after walking a great deal about Town went imprudently to a Pump and drank too freely of cold Water in Consequence of which he was taken very ill at Mr. Binghams where he was at Dinner and obliged to go home and be bled and vomited. I hope he will be able to go out to day: but he had a nice nice risque of his Life. Mr. Bingham lives in great Splendor and his Lady shines among the Senators as with all the rest of the World. Mr. Morris lives at  Lansdown. Seeing Mrs. Morris in the House in Town I went in and made my Compliments. She made the usual Enquiries about you. Kid, has bought the Land at 100 a foot between the Presidents House and Mr. Morris's House and is building a new House there.

","My Dearest Friend Last Night the Consul General De la Tombe made me a Visit with your kind Letter of the 18th. He looks older than When I last saw him and he is indeed a fortunate Man: He gave me many details of affairs in  France: a gloomy Picture of the Reign of Terror and a smiling one of the present Reign of Moderation.: but he is not without Inquietude on the subject of a Constitution. By the Turn which the Debates and Deliberations in Senate took Yesterday, We must  next Week and I have now little hope of Liberty till the last day of it. Some Members, perhaps wish to give time to Mr. Adet to open his Budget, which it is conjectured may contain Propositions on the Part of  France. The Sun is terrible here as well as at   I beg you to be afraid of him and keep out of his Beams. I dread going out to  Lansdowne to dinner at Mr. Morris's on sunday according to his invitation. The News you mention from  Hallifax is very .  I wish that Misfortune and Adversity could soften the Temper and humiliate the Insolence of John Bull: but he is not yet sufficiently humbled. If I mistake not it is to be the Destiny of  America one day to beat down her Pride. But the Irksome task will not soon, I hope be forced upon Us. All this is under the Rose.  "

","My Dearest Friend I received yesterday two Letters from each of our Sons at the  Hague, who were very well and in good Spirits on the 25th of April: but the Letters contain so much Information, that I have been obliged to lend them to The Secretary of the Treasury: I shall  them to you however on Monday. All the next Week will be taken up, I suppose in further Investigations of the Subject before Senate, and indeed I should be very glad to be  that the Decision will be as early as Saturday. If it should be earlier I shall be agreably disappointed. I shall take my Departure as soon as the Business is done, and I hope you will be ready to join me at  New York on our Way home without further loss of time. The Day is at hand when Governor Jay is to take the Reins in  New York: may his Administration by easy to himself and happy for the People.

","My Dearest Friend The Sun is so bright and augurs such heat that I am doubtful whether I shall go out to  Landsdowne to dinner. I dined Yesterday at Mr. Wolcotts the Secretary of The Treasury with King, Elsworth,  and a few others. The Conversation turn'd upon old times. One of the Company expressed such Inveteracy against my old Friend Gerry that I could not help taking up his Vindication. The future Election of a Governer, in Case of an empty Chair, excites a Jealousy which I have long perceived. These Things will always be so. Gerrys Merit is inferiour to that of no Man in the  Massachusetts, except the present Governor, according to My Ideas and Judgment of Merit. I wish he was more enlarged however and more correct in his Views. He never was one of the threads tyed into the knot, and was never popular with that Sett. I sent you Yesterday four Letters from our sons, which have been approved by all who have read them. Mr. Wolcott thinks that the Report of Merlin upon  as quoted in Tommys Letter ought to be published. Charles may get it inserted in a Paper without Names or any Circumstances which can indicate the source from whence it comes. If you know  Mr. Webster you may let him read those Letters in Confidence. My hopes are to be at   by Saturday night. But my fears are stronger that I shall not get away from  Philadelphia before Monday. If Senate should finish on Wednesday I shall sett out on Thursday. But this will depend on the Will of others.  I am with unfeigned Affection    "

","My Dearest Friend Some Senators are confident We shall rise tomorrow or next day. If so, I shall be with you on Sunday. But these Conjectures are always uncertain. I shall write you every day so that you will be apprized of the time when you may expect me. Both the public Dispatches and private Letters of our dear Boys are the delight of all who read them. No public Minister has ever given greater Satisfaction, than Mr. Adams has hitherto. His Prudence, Caution and penetration are as much  approved as the Elegance of his Style is admired. Providence I hope and pray will make him a Blessing to his Country as well as to his Parents. I went out to  Lansdowne on Sunday about half a mile on this Side Judge Peters's where you once dined. The Place is very retired, but very beautiful a Splendid House, gravel Walks, Shrubberies and Clumps of Trees in the English Style -- on the Bank of the Skuylkill. Jona. Williams's House, which was once McPhersons is over the River. It is the first time I have trodden the new Turnpike Road which is a great Improvement. "

","My Dearest Friend The Senate advanced Yesterday in their deliberations with so much Diligence that it would be very easy to finish : but it is not probable to me, that they will. Whether Tomorrow or next day or the day after I cannot determine. The Weather begins to be so hot, though We have this morning some Appearances of Rain that I wish to get away. Tide must rise early on our Journey and take Advantage of the cool of the Morning; rest in the middle of the day, and travel again in the Evening. In this Way I hope We shall find it comfortable, or at least tolerable. It would give me great Pleasure, to visit General Gates and make my Observations on his Husbandry and Gardening: I should hope to learn Lessons and acquire Experience in my  Business and Amusement: But the time will not permit. My Affairs at home demand my immediate Attention.  I am with ardent Affection    I dine  with Col. Pickering  and tomorrow with the President. But if Senate finishes to day, I will make my apology. "

","My Dearest Friend The Senate is to meet at Ten, this morning and I hope will finish: but it is still uncertain. I shall  out this Afternoon, provided the Senate rises. But I shall not be able to reach  New York by tomorrow night. If I am not restrained from riding on Sunday I may arrive on that day: But on Sunday or Monday I think, barring Accidents, you may expect me. I have been detained so long, the hot weather advances so rapidly and our Attention at home is so much wanted that We must take Leave the next morning after my Arrival in  N.Y. I shall say nothing of Public affairs because the least said is soonest amended. "

","My Dearest Friend We have been  with fine Weather and tolerable Roads in such a manner that We reached  Kings bridge on Fryday night and came into  N. York by Nine o Clock in Yesterday morning. If it had not been for the Desire of seeing my Children I should have gone immediately on with the other Passengers. The stage House was so near C. Smiths and I knew not where my Son lived: so that I put up at  Cortland Street: but for the future I will drive to my Sons. My Grandsons and Grand Daughter are all very well and very gay. The Girl is a fine Child and will have La peau d'un Ange as the Baron De Stael said her Mother had, and I hope will be fort Spirituelle as the same Ambassador said her  was. Mr. Paine the Senator from  Vermont and Mr. Freeman of  Barnstable, were our only Companions in the Stage till We reached  New Haven. As soon as I had dressed myself I walked out to find Mr. Adams The Lawyer. I was told he lived in  Front Street No. 91. I went through  Broad Way and  Wall Street to Mr. McCormicks who was complaisant enough to take his hat and Cloak and conduct me to the House in Front Street No. 91. The House is new near the River among the Navigation. The Windows on the back side have a fine View of a forest of Masts, the  Sound and  long Island. It must be a very good stand for Business. Accordingly They say he has twice or thrice the Employment he ever had before. I found him in his office, which is large and commodious and well stored with Book Learning at least, with three Clients about him in very deep and earnest Consultation. He lets part of the House for half the Rent. Charles acquired the Character of a Wit, at the Time of the Epidemic Matrimony here. Some Gentleman asked him in the Country ""How is the Fever Sir in Town?"" Which Fever do you  after Sir? The Yellow Fever or the Smith Fever? said Charles. The Gentleman told the story in the City and it flew through the streets quicker than either of the Fevers. The Lady of the Baron De Stael has lately published a Work under the Title of  on Peace, which Mr. D'Ivernois has answered by another under the Title of Reflections on the War which he has sent me in French and another for the President in English. The Author has given some Account of ""The Defence &c. and gives it the Preference, to all other Writers upon Govt. But all his Recommendations will have little Effect. I wish, if it is possible, that our Men, after carting out the Manure upon the old Clover at home, would cart out that whole heap of limed manure in Mr. Joys Cowyard, upon  Quincys Meadow, as well as the heap already in the Meadow. These two heaps will give the Meadow a good dressing. They should be careful to mix the Lime with the other Ingredients as  as possible. The other heap upon  Penshill should be mixed in the same manner when that is carted out, and the whole very carefully spread. Tomorrow Morning at Seven I cross the North River for  Philadelphia. I am as I ever have been and ever shall be your affectionate  "

","My dearest Friend  Before the Post departs I have only time to tell you that I arrived here last night at nine O Clock in good health. A storm the night before last Spoiled the Roads and made the Journey  from  N York. I Spent two nights and one day and a half with our Children very pleasantly. Mr. Tazewell had been made President and the Speech had been delivered. A fair Picture of our Prosperity but I could Sketch another with more shades. I believe however from the Complexion of Men and Things that Government will be Supported and respected. I had a curious Ride from  , with a curious Company. They all treated me with more Respect, than they did any Thing else. "
Philadelphia Decr. 13. 1795,"Extract from the Political Dispatch No. 6 of Citizen Fauchet Minister Plenipotentiary of the  French Republic to the  United States. Scarce was the commotion known, when the Secretary of State came to my House. All his Countenance was grief He requested of me a private Conversation. It is all over, he said to me. A civil War is about to ravage our unhappy Country. Four Men, by their Talents, their Influence, and their  may Save it. But, Debtors of English Merchants, they will be deprived of their Liberty, if they take the Smallest Step. Could you lend them instantaneously Funds, Sufficient to Shelter them from English Persecution. This Enquiry astonished me much. It was impossible for me to make a Satisfactory Answer. You know my Want of Power and my defect of pecuniary means. I shall draw myself from the Affair by some common Place Remarks and by throwing myself on the pure and unalterable Principles of the Republic. I have never since heard of Propositions of this nature. My Dearest Friend Governor Martin, was civil enough to lend me Yesterday Mr. Randolphs Statement of Faith as far as it is printed. The foregoing Extract is the most material, as well as the most enigmatical Part of it. It is advertised to be published next ; but I still doubt whether  it will come out unmutilated. The Copy I have stops short at the most material Thing, the Extract on the other side. If he can and will explain that, and another Paragraph in a succeeding dispatch No. 10 which refers to it he will do wonders. The President is serene, healthy, in good Spirits and so is his Lady who with Mrs. Green who is again here send many Compliments and Expressions of great regard. I have no Letter from you as yet. The Passage in Fauchet's dispatch No. 10 which refers to R.G. is this. 16. In the mean time, although there was a certainty of having an Army, yet it was necessary to assure themselves of  among the Men whose Patriotic Reputations might influence their Party, and whose Lukewarmness and Want of Energy in the existing Conjunctures might compromise the Success of the Plans. Of all the Governors whose Duty it was to appear at the head of the Requisitions, the Governor of  Pensilvania alone enjoyed the name of Republican: his opinion of the Secretary of the Treasury and of his Systems was known to be unfavourable. The Secretary of this State possessed great Influence in the popular Society of  Philadelphia, which in its turn influenced those of other states; of Course he merited Attention. It appears therefore that those Men with others unknown to me, all having without doubt Randolph at their head, were balancing to decide on their Party. Two or three days, before the Proclamation was published, and of Course before the Cabinet had resolved on its measures, Mr. Randolph came to see me, with an Air of great Eagerness, and made to me the overtures of which I have given you an Account in my No. 6. Thus with some Thousands of Dollars the Republic could have decided on civil War, or on Peace. Thus the Consciences of the pretended Patriots of  America have already their Prices. It is very true, that the Certainty  of these Conclusions, painful to be drawn will forever exist in our Archives! What will be the Old Age of this Government if it is thus early decrepid! Such Citizen is the Evident consequence of the system of Finances conceived by Mr. Hamilton. He has made of a whole Nation a Stockjobbing, Speculating, selfish People. Riches alone here see consideration; and as no one likes to be despized they are universally sought after. Nevertheless this depravity has not yet embraced the Mob of the People, &c. I leave you to your own Reflections upon this which must be in Confidence till you hear further from your affectionate  "

","My Dearest Friend The Newspapers will inform you before this Letter reaches you that the Ratifications of the Treaty have been exchanged by Mr. Deas the Charge d'Affairs under Mr. Pinkney. The President told me the orders were that if Mr. Adams did not arrive by a certain day this Business was to be done by another. Whether our Son will go over at all or not is to me uncertain. If he has lost a White Feather, he has avoided a dark one: so that he is as well off. There are Letters from him in the Public Offices  in September. Having no Letter from you has given me Anxiety for your health, especially as I recollect you complained of some Rheumatic symptoms before I came away. My own health is as good as it has been for some years. The Countenance of the House wears no very threatening Aspect. The Senate have refused their Consent to the Nomination of Mr. Rutledge.  I hope that Chief Justices at least will learn from this to be cautious how they go to popular Meetingsat especially unlawful: assemblies to spout Reflections and excite opposition to the legal Acts of Constitutional Authority. The Assembly of  New Hampshire have appalled one of their Senators and gratified the Friends of Peace, order and good Government. Their Unanimity could hardly have been expected. I hope the  Massachusetts Assembly when they meet will at least vote no Resistance to the Law of the Land. I learned from the Children in the Wood not to hallos before We get out of the Wood, but I think the Prospect of Peace is brighter now than it has been for Several Years. Your Friends here are all well and  after, you as usual on every occasion. The President seems in as good Health and Spirits as ever I knew him. Mr. Brisler sprained his Ankle which has interrupted his Business somewhat: but he is now better and will soon be quite well. As soon as he is so he will look up some Flour and Grass seeds &c. My Duty to my Mother of whose Situation I  wish to be informed. Love to all. Let me know the Progress of Farming &c.  I am entirely and forever Yours  "
"Philadelphia  Decr. 17. 1795
","My Dearest Friend I went to Senate this morning with Expectations highly raised of receiving my first Letter from you: and happily was not disappointed. I began to entertain fears for your health. I know not how to account for it, but your short Accounts of the Progress of Business upon the farm Serves as a Substitute for the Pleasure of Seeing it as it goes on: and every Word of it is a cordial drop. The Weather Since the 10th the date of your Letter has been as fine as it had been from the time I left  so that I presume our People have made a good hand of it, in Spreading the Manure from the heaps. You must not forget your Wood. I congratulate you upon the Receipt of your Miniatures, and am very glad you find them Likenesses: I shall have my feast in looking at them next Summer. Col. Pickering told me, he had Letters from John dated in September. He loves to read his Correspondence and contrast it with another which he cannot admire. I doubt now whether my Son will go over to  England at all: but am not certain. The Negative put by the Senate on the Nomination of Mr. Rutledge gave me pain for an old Friend, though I could not but think he deserved it. C. Justius must not go to illegal Meetings and become popular orators  of Sedition, nor inflame the popular discontents which are ill founded, nor propagate Disunion, Division, Contention and delusions among the People. I never thought him the greatest Man in the World, nor had any final Confidence in his Penetration or his Constancy or Consistency. I have also had Reason to suspect that the French had too much Influence with him to leave him perfectly neutral or impartial. The Disarrangement of his Affairs, the Reports of his Eccentricities &c. had not made so much Impression upon me. But all Things considered, the Senate were very decided that such an Example ought to be made. I know you will naturally inquire whether any Notice will be taken of Mr. Masons Disobedience to the order of the Senate, in his publication of the Treaty. I make no Inquiries upon such Subjects -- they are not connected with any Branch of my Duty. But from accidental hints I have heard the subject is not forgotten. The Completion of the House of Representatives is not so formidable as many expected and the Voice of the People from  Maryland Northward is much more  to the Treaty than was imagined, and indeed in  North Carolina, though they may not disapprove of the Votes of their Senators their disposition to acquiesce in the decision of Authority is said to be very good.  Jackson of  Georgia has resigned and my old Friend Walton is coming in his Place.  [?] writes that he is for order and good Government. We are daily overlooked by our Masters in the Gallery: but there has not yet been many debates which could afford much Gratification to their Curiosity. The Debate on the Prefaces to the Presidents Speech has been the only one of any Consequence. The arguments of those who were in  of it have been very poorly reported to the Public in Gazettes. This Partiality will be one ill Effect of the Gallery. But upon the whole I hope it will do more good than harm. I will present your Respect and Affection as you desire. My Duty to my Mother.  I am as ever most affectionately yours  "

",My Dearest Friend Yesterday We had snow of two or three Inches deep only. I dined with Mrs. Powell who expresses still her usual high regard for you. I have written and sent  to our sons by Mr. Hall who sailed yesterday sails to day. I send you Randolph's Book. Mrs. Powell calls it Randolphs Crimination not Vindication. It is a very weak thing. He has disclosed Secrets very dishonorably without any proper Motive. It is a Piece of Revenge against the President but for what Injury or Offence I cannot discover. If he had made out that the P. had prejudged his Case and that he ought not to have prejudged his Case what follows from there? His Innocence? I think not. Fauchets dispatch is a silly think. His Logick is fetter for a Comedian than a Statesman. He charges all  America with being Stockjobbers &c. and  [?] it all to Mr. Hamiltons systems. Strange nonsense. The affair is all darkness. 
"Philadelphia  Decr. 21. 1795,
","My Dearest Friend My old Acquaintance Mr. Walton, who served in Congress, with me in 1776 and 1777 is returned a Senator from  Georgia in the room of General Jackson who has resigned. He is or has lately been Chief Justice. As old Acquaintances are easily Sociable We soon fell into Conversation about Affairs old and new. I asked him whether The Negative of Mr. Rutledge would have any ill Effects at the southward. He says No by no means -- on the Contrary he is sure it will have a very good Effect. He adds he was rejoiced when he heard upon his Arrival that it was done, because it saved him and his Colleague from the Necessity of giving a  Vote: but that they both came to Town with a determination to vote against the Appointment. He says that a Disarrangement of Intellect certainly exists and has been more decisive lately than formerly. That he has not been able to attend the Circuit Court in  Georgia nor in  North Carolina. That he attempted to attend in  N. Carolina but was so bad that he could not. That he even attempted to make way with himself. He was himself at the House and made himself fully acquainted with the Fact. He adds that Mr. R's Conduct as Chief Justice of the State of  S. Carolina has been lately so unsatisfactory that several Grand Juries have presented him for what they thought Misconduct or at least Negligence of his Duty. The Embarrassment of his private Affairs has lately pressed harder upon him than ever and produced or at least accellerated and increased the Disorder of his Mind. These Things being so We shall hear of no very sharp Rebukes Upon the Senate, for the Vote they have passed and the President will have avoided giving any Offence to particular Friends. This is all in Confidence between You and me as I know you will have some anxiety upon this subject, as I have had a great deal. I have felt for an old Friend and his Friends. He is a Brother of your Friend Mrs. Smith whom you knew in  London and has been a worthy Man. But the Man who plumps into Debt will soon get out of his Depth. You must mention these Things with great discretion and only in Confidence. You will soon see Fauchets Letter and Randolphs Pamphlet. What  do they open? The Duplicity of that shallow Fellow has been greater than any one suspected him capable of. -- Where did Fauchet get his Information of a general Plott against the Government and Mr. Hamiltons Plans: He and his Colleagues may pretend to as much Purity as they will, but I am not convinced that they have not dabbled these fifteen Years in Corruption in this Country. I have known for the whole of that Period so many of my Country men fawning, cringing and creeping after them that I find it difficult to impute it all to   simple servility. I have not been without suspicions of some Characters, whom I dont choose to name even in a Letter to You. There is however a native servility in some Men which produces almost all the base Effects of Corruption itself. There are Persons who depend upon a foreign Influence to give them Credit, Consequence and Power in their own Country, and I have sometimes thought their Chance better for Preferment, than that of those who stand only on American Ground. Their Peace of Mind however can never be secure however they may gratify their mean ambition. -- Oh my sons-- Be ye independent at all  and at every risque. There can be no Comfort in a dependence on a foreign Interest or Influence, whether British, French or Dutch.  "

","My Dearest Friend Inclosed is a Post note for Six hundred Dollars out of which I pray you to repay Dr. Tufts the three hundred We borrowed and the rest I hope will answer your Ends till March. My  here are so enormous, two subscriptions for erecting Colledges in  Kentucky and in the Western Territory and a small, too small assistance to Charles will make it almost impossible for me to answer the Demands on me during the Quarter. I am my Dearest Friend affectionately yours "
NA,"My Dearest Friend I wrote you this morning  a Post note for 600 and went to Senate with full Expectation of receiving a Letter from you. The Door Keeper had the Letters for others but none for me -- What a Disappointment? I went mourning and moaping about for some time, grumbling at my Stars and almost blaming my best Friend: but it was not long before the Letter of the 15 was brought me from the President to whom the Post Office had sent it by Mistake. I am glad the Clover is covered and that French is paid extravagant as he is. The Anti Treaty People are not supported by the People generally nor by their Legislatures.  North Carolina has left them in the Lurch and it is supposed   will not be up to their Pitch. In short all the opposition to the Treaty is likely to vanish in Vapour and foul Smoke. The Assembly of  Virginia, however, have passed a Number of hair  Resolutions for amending the Constitution, in which I believe they will not be Seconded, unless by  Kentucky, After the Experience of our own Government and that of  France, when all Sensible Men are convinced that our Constitution, if defective in any Part, wants more Strength in the Senate and Executive, to propose to make the Senate dependent on Annual Elections and the House of Representatives to participate more in Executive Power is  a flight of Ignorance and folly that I could not have expected from a People like the Virginians: nor can it be accounted for but by that Spirit of Irritation and Fervor which is inspired by Conscious Debts. The Senate is as firm as a Rock and has received I believe an Accession of Strength in the new Member from  Georgia. The Newspapers begin to throw out hints about Titles and Checks and  with a distant View to the approaching Election of Electors of P. and V.P. But this at present will counteract their own hopes: for Checks and Ballances having been adopted in Part at least in  France, begin to grow more popular all over  Europe and  America. I dined with The P. Yesterday, and shall again to day. I wish to read your Observations upon Randolphs what shall I call it? -- I sent it by last Post. I think it is too evident that the Creature meditated a total defeat of the Treaty; and he had too much Influence in proceeding several Steps in the Business. The Plan Seems to have been to delay the Ratification till the People should have time to set up such a  as to make it impossible to sign it at all. This was a very friendly Attachment to the Honour and Faith of the P. to be sure, to say nothing of The Senate or Mr. Jay. Such a Character in the Cabinet and in the P.s bosom was a Serpent that might have stung if his Invention, Cunning and Courage had been adequate. The P. is more than commonly incensed as I hear against this Man and he certainly has great Reason. His Pamphlet has not blunted the Edge, nor diminished the force of Fauchets Letter in the least. It must totally destroy the Confidence in both Characters for what I see. -There are Letters to the Offices from Mr. Adams dated in September. Dont be uneasy. We shall hear in due time.  "
Monday Morning Decr. 28. 1795,"My dearest Friend I have just received from the  Office your Letter of the 20th, by Brisler who went to carry one for you. I write by every Post i.e. by Mondays and Thursdays which are the only ones on which Mails are made up for any Place beyond  N. York, and the only ones on which Letters arrive here from any Place beyond that City. Mrs. Adams your new Daughter behaves prettily in her new Sphere. I dined with them one day and promised, to take my Lodgings with them the next time.Mrs. Adams  me an elegant bed which she politely said she had made up for me. As to the details in which you say the Ladies excell Us, I have not Patience. I who have the Patience of Job,  [illegible]   have not Patience to write Letters in the style of Grandison and Lovelau. Commonly You would admire to see with what [illegible]   Serenity and Intrepidity I sett and hear. Not all the Froth can move my contempt, not all the Sedition stirr my Indignation, nor all the Nonsense and Deliverance excite my Pity. If Dignity consists in total Infeasibility I believe my Countenance has it. B. however tells me he can always perceive when I dont like any Thing. It must be by reasoning from what he knows to be my opinions. My Countenance skews nothing for the most part. Sometimes I believe it may be legible enough. The  upon Peace by Madam De Stael are not here. The President and Presidentess always send their Regards to you. Madam invites you to come next Summer to  Mount Vernon and visit the  City. I am almost afraid to write it to you for fear it should turn your head and give you thought and hopes of accepting the Invitation. I told Madame La Presidante, that after the Year 1800 when Congress should set at  Washington and that City became very great I thought it not impossible that You and your sister Cranch might seriously entertain such a Project, for the sake of making a Visit to Mount Vernon as well as seeing Mrs. Cranches Grand Children. Always write me how Mrs. Brisler and her Children are. It makes the good Mans Countenance shine so bright when I tell him of it, that I take a great Pleasure in reading these Paragraphs to him.  I am anxious to hear of. My Duty to her and Love, Compliments &c. &c. to whom you please.  "

","My dearest Friend You will see by the Production of Jonathan Pinlow in the  that the Aristocrat has given a Title to your Husband. A couple of little Villains are before the House on a Charge of attempting to bribe the Members. In the Course of this Business a Number of Useful Lessons will be taught. 1. One is to the People to entertain a little more respect for their  2. Another is to the Reps. to entertain more respect for themselves. The Treaty has produced this , and it shews Us the Corruption of Canada Merchants as well as their Opinion of the Corruptibility of others.   "

","My Dearest Friend The Weather here is as fine as it was the last Year. The Festival season of Christmas and the new Year, is enjoyed in Perfection by all, for what I know, but poor Cabot and me. It is as solitary and disconsolate as a lone Goose. He strives to keep up his Spirits and preserve his usual Gaiety but one plainly perceives it is all Exertion. There are Letters to the Secretary of State upon public Affairs, from  as late as 5th of October. I dont expect that he will go over to  England at all. Upon the whole it will be as well that he should not. Two Speculating Landjobbing Villains, in combination with Indian Traders at  Detroit, will take up the House of Representatives half the Winter for what I know. I see no Necessity for all this Parade. They might have been sent to Prison at once for Contempt, during the session and ordered to be prosecuted by the  Gen. Our two Grandsons at  New York have the Measles and the Grandaughter is expected to have them. The season of the Year is as  as their Age, and it is will be fortunate for them to have gone through this unavoidable Evil thus early in Life. The H. of Reps in  S.C. have behaved amiss -- but they did not dare to send their firebrand to the Senate, and almost half their Number went out of the House. The Vote is the meanest which has ever been passed. Not one of the Mobs have been so sordid as to the whole Treaty upon the single Point of Pay for the Negroes. S.C.,  V. and  Kentucky I believe will be the only States which will  their Teeth and they can not bite. Goodhue is almost discouraged or at least quite out of Patience. He says  ""the whole History of the Government has been one continued  to roll a Stone up a Steep hill. It is too fatiguing to be always on the Stretch -- and a Government that requires so much Pains to support it is not worth preserving."" It is indeed the tone of Sysiphus. Van borchket tells me that the new French Government is not  to The Dutch. They are as yet too Jacobinical. He thinks the French Constitution will turn upon a Pivot, and come round at length to  ""The Defence of the C. of U.S."" De L'Etombe tells me that  ""The "" has not only been laid down by Boissy D'Anglass, as their future Model, but has been frequently quoted of late in the Convention by many other of the principal Members as their first authority."" I wish they understood their authority better or had more Fortitude, Competency and Influence in adopting and establishing the genuine Principles of that Work. I have often told you laughing, what may become a real Truth that  ""I shall be the great Legislator of Nations and that Nations must learn of me or  one anothers throats."" This sounds like the Bombast of Mad Tom: Thus much is a Serious Truth that  Nations must all become followers of Zeno not of me, or wrangle and fight forever. I am but a Disciple of Zeno. I dined on Thursday with Adet who called upon me for a Toast. I gave an happy Success to the new Government in  France. The French Company seemed to relish it better than our Frenchified Americans.

","My dearest Friend There is a dead calm in the political Atmosphere, which furnishes no Event worth relating. The House of  is wholly taken up with two worthless Agents of Corruption. I have this day however heard News that is of some Importance. It must be kept a Secret wholly to yourself. One of the Ministry told me  that the President was solemnly determined to serve no longer than the End of his present Period. He mentioned such Circumstances of solemn Observation as left him no room to doubt. Mrs. W. said one thing to me lately which seemed to imply as much. Others, Men of the first Weight, I find consider the Event as certain. You know the Consequence of this, to me and to yourself. Either We must enter upon Ardours more trying than any ever yet experienced; or retire to  Quincy Farmers for Life. (I am at least determined not to serve under Jefferson, as W. is not to serve at all. I will not be frightened out of the public service nor will I be   disgraced in it.) You will say that he will be over persuaded. You know what Jerremy said of Elijah.  ""His poor soul would have no chance for salvation for he had sworn most bitterly."" The Weather is mild as last Winter. No snow. No frost. Farmers may plough. I received Yesterday  your  of the 27 . Who Randolphs four mighty Men were, I know not. I am much mortified to reflect that I ever had any Opinion of that Creatures head or heart. There are Letters from  as far as 5th of October in the Office of State. His public Correspondence is still very punctual and quite Satisfactory. Randolphs Intrigues to defeat the Treaty defeated him of the  of going to  England but I dont regret it.   I am with the tenderest Affection your     "

","My Dearest Friend  is another Production of Porcupine, whose quils will stick. ""And Midas now neglected Stands With Asses ears and dirty hands."" The President appears great in Randolphs Vindication throughout excepting that he wavered about signing the Treaty which he ought not to have done one moment. Happy is the Country to be rid of Randolph: but where shall be found good Men and true to fill the offices of Government. There seems to be a Necessity of distributing the Offices about the States in some Proportion to their Numbers: but in the Southern Part of the Union false  have struck their roots so deep that it is very difficult to find Gentlemen who are willing to accept of public Trusts and at the same time capable of discharging them. The President offered the Office of State to Seven Gentlemen who declined: to Mr. Patterson, Mr. King, Mr. Henry of  Virginia, Mr. Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of  S.C. and three others whose names I dont recollect. He has not been able to find any one to accept the War Office. The Expences of living at the Seat of Government are so exorbitant, so far beyond all Proportion to the salaries  and the sure Reward of Integrity in the discharge of public functions is such Obloquy, Contempt and Insult, that no Man of any feeling is willing to renounce his home, forsake his Property and Profession for the sake of removing to  Philadelphia where he is almost sure of disgrace and Ruin. Where these Things will end I know not. In perfect Secrecy between You and me, I must tell you that I now believe the P. will retire. The Consequence to me is very serious and I am not able as yet to see what my Duty will demand of me. I shall take my Resolutions with cool deliberation, I shall watch the Course of Events with more critical attention than I have done for some time, and what Providence shall point out to be my Duty I shall pursue with Patience, and Decision. It is no light thing to resolve upon Retirement. My Country has claims -- my Children have claims and my own Character have claims upon me. But all These Claims forbid me to serve the Public in disgrace. What ever any one may think I love my Country too well to shrink from Danger in her service provided I have a reasonable prospect of being able to serve her to her honour and Advantage. But if I have Reason to think that I have either a Want of Abilities or of public Confidence to such a degree as to be unable to support the Government in a higher Station, I ought to decline it. But in that Case, I ought not to serve in my present Place under another especially if that other should entertain sentiments so opposite to mine as to endanger the Peace of the Nation. It will be a dangerous Crisis in public affairs if the President and Vice President shall be in opposite Boxes. These Lumbrations must be confined to Years over But I think upon the whole the Probability is strong that I shall make a voluntary Retreat and spend the rest of my days in a very humble Style with you. Of one Thing I am very sure. It would be to me the happiest Portion of my whole Life.  I am with unabatable Affection Yours    "

""The Dispatches of which I have hereby acknowledged the Receipt were forwarded from  Hamburg by Mr. Parish, who mentions that they were sent to him by Mr. Frazer, the English Minister at that Place, in consequence of orders from Lord Grenville. By the Superscription on the outward Cover of your Letters it appears, that Mr. Hammond was the Bearer of them from  America. Immediately upon the Receipt of your last orders, I took measures preparatory to my Departure from  London. The regular Communication between these Provinces and  England being still interrupted I am obliged to go by way of  Hamburg, or to take the Advantage  of the first neutral Vessell, intending to go from Home to  London. Such an opportunity presents itself and I hope to sail from  Rotterdam, some day between the 20 and 25 of the current Month. Confirmably to your Directions, I shall commit the affairs of the  United States here to the Charge of my Secretary during my Absence, and observing the usual Attentions during upon a temporary Absence, shall endeavour to obviate any Impressions that may arise from my going to  London at this Period. The peculiarity of Circumstances which mark the present Moment, so recent since the declaration of War by  Great Britain against these Provinces, and happening at the Instant, when the decision is taken for the Convocation of a general national Assembly, which changes the Supreme Authority of this Country, will perhaps render my departure specially liable to Observation, but I hope that the Explanation I shall make will prevent any Umbrage being taken, upon erroneous Suspicions.""

I have received  your  of the 3d. of this month  and am much afflicted at the News of your painful Hand and more still with your Rhumatic Affections. Your Account of farming is rather too concise. The Weather here is as moderate as Spring. A little snow falls and is immediately washed away by plentiful Rains which are soon followed by soft Weather and  Winds. A Calm in : but anxious Expectations from  Europe. I dined last Week at the French Ministers with the virtuous ten, the virtuous Mr. Gallatin, Mr. Dallas and others. The Speaker of the House was there.  Mr. Adet called upon me for a Toast and I gave  ""An happy Success to the new Government in  France"" which I wish with all my heart, without much hope of its long duration. Emulation in the Directory will soon produce Divisions, Jealousies, Envy, hatred and every Evil Word, Thought and Work. Between ourselves, Every Person I meet believes The P. is determined unequivocally to retire. This is more interesting to Us than to any other Family because it necessitates me to determine whether I shall unequivocally retire too or not.    "

We go on as We always have done, for the three first months of the Session, distributing Business into the hands of Committees, meeting and adjourning. The Gallery finds little Entertainment in our Debates. We have Seldom more than 30 or 40 in it sometimes 4 or 5 and sometimes none at all. The Treaty is again unaccountably delayed. We are not well Served. These disappointments frequently force from me a vain glorious boast in my own breast, which however I never utter but to you.  ""It was not thus in my Day."" And what is much more dear to my heart.  ""It is not thus where my Son is."" The British Government appears to be driven to hard Shifts. They are hazarding a dangerous Bill, to suppress . I wish it may not weaken rather than strengthen their hands. But restless Democracy struggling for Aristocracy, will destroy itself and introduce Despotism as I fear.

","My Dearest Friend This is one of my red Letter Days. It is the Anniversary of the Signature of the Declaration of an Armistice between The  U.S. and  G. Britain, in 1783. There are Several of these Days in my , which I recollect as they pass in review, but which nobody else remembers. And indeed it is no otherwise worth my while to remember them than to render an Ejaculation of Gratitude to Providence for the Blessing. We are wasting our Time in the most insipid manner waiting for the Treaty. Nothing of any Consequence will be done, till that arrives and is mauled and abused and then  in. For the Antes must be more numerous than I believe them and made of Sterner Stuff than I conceive, if they dare hazard the Surrender of the Posts and the Payment for, by any Resolution of the House that shall render precarious the Execution of the Treaty on our Part.

It is not a subject of Conversation as yet. I have a pious and a philosophical Resignation to the Voice of the People in this Case which is the Voice of God. I have no very ardent desire to be the Butt of Party Malevolence. Having tasted of that Cup I found it bitter, nauseous and unwholesome. I hope Copland will find his six Loads to  the Meadow -- and take the first opportunity to cart or sled the Manure from the Yard at home up to the Top of  Stony field Hill. The first season that happens fit for ploughing should be employed in crop ploughing the Ground at home over the Way. The News of  Arm growing better, has given me great Pleasure. Of the four Barrells of flour I have shipped to you, present one of them to my Mother from me with my Duty and Affection. Tell my Brother I hope he has seen his Error and become a better friend of Peace and good Government, than he has been somewhat inclined to be since the Promulgation of the Treaty.  I am with Affections as ever Your   Though I have alluded to  your Letter of Jan. 10  I have not before expressly acknowledged the Rest of it.   "

","My Dearest Friend I have nothing to write you at this moment but Scandal, and that about one of our Connections and Acquaintances, in whose Character and Fortunes Several of our near Relations and kind Friends are deeply interested for which Reason I write in Confidence and pray that Calumny if it is such may not be propagated from me nor in my name. It is reported here in Company of Senators and others of Senatorial Dignity that Mr. Greenleaf by Virtue of a  Connecticut Divine in Imitation of Captain Beal is about to marry Nancy Allen. It is also reported that Mr. Greenleaf has taken Advantage of the  of the  Boston Speculators in whose Estimation Dollars seem of no more Value than Cents ought to be to make an enormous hall of fishes to the amount of half a Million of Dollars  by a very Artful Sale of shares at a monstrous Price in a purchase he made of Mr. Gun of  Georgia Lands at a very trifling one. The House of Representatives will do no Business with any Spirit before the Treaty arrives. The disaffected are intriguing but accounts from all quarters are very discouraging to them. We have been very unfortunate in the Delays which have Attended the Dispatches of our Ambassadors. Very Lucky , that you are not liable to criticism upon this occasion! This  [illegible]   Demurrage would have been charged doubly, both to your Account and that of your Father. It would have been a Shame! a Trick and a design Scheme a Contrivance. From hatred to  France, Attachment to  England, monarchical Maneuvres and Aristocratical Cunning! Oh how eloquent they would have been. The Southern Gentry are playing at present a very  Game, which I may devallope to you in  Confidence hereafter, under the Seal of Secrecy. Both in Conversation and in Letters they are representing the Vice President as a Man of Moderation. Although rather inclined to limited Monarchy and somewhat attached to the English, he is much less so that Jay or Hamilton. For their Parts for the sake of Conciliation they should be very Willing he should be continued as Vice President, provided Jefferson the Northern Gentlemen would consent that Jefferson should be President. I most humbly thank you for your kind Condescension, Messieurs Transcheasapeaks.   "

","Yesterday I came to Senate as usual on a monday morning pleasing my Imagination and my heart with the hope and reputation of a Letter from -- my dearest Friend. No Letter for The Vice President says Mothers! All Day in bad  -- dirty Weather -- wet walking -nothing good -- nothing right. The poor Post offices did not escape -- it was Some blunder -some  of theirs -- in  Philadelphia --  New York or  Boston. Or Perhaps Mam is Sick -- Oh dear!  -- Oh dear! Fever and Ague! Thus peevishly, fretfully and unphilosophically was Yesterday passed. Yet to divert it I read a Number of Books in Cowpers Homer and Smooked I know not how many Segars. I have had the  Society of Josiah Quincy and Martin Lincoln, to assist in consoling me a little of late. There is absolutely nothing to write public nor private but such as the above.    Adieu   "

","My Dearest Friend Yesterday which was Post Day from the Eastward I was disappointed again of a Letter and went pesting all the day long against the Post Office. But this morning has produced me  Yours of the 15th  which informs me that you meet with similar . There has not one Post parted from  Philadelphia for  Boston Since I have been here without a Letter from me to You. Wednesdays and Saturdays are the only ones when the Mail is made up for  Boston and  Quincy and I make a Point of never Suffering one of them to pass without a Letter. Your Letters are the greatest Pleasure of my Life here -- but in your last not one Word about the Farm. Mr. Langworthy and Dr. Bollman have called upon me this Week and are both intelligent Men. I have read this Week Dr. Styles's History of Whalley Goffe, Diswell and Whale and Governor Adams's Spech to the General Court and I find them both  Examples of Superannination. In the Speech I see the fruit of old Spite against Washington, Jay and old  England as well as weak affectation of Popularity. Personal Malice against Men or Countries, has either no Existence in my heart, or they are suppressed and overawed by a decisive sentiment of their Antichristian and Antiphilosophical and Antimoral Turpitude and Deformity. Yet I cannot answer for lips may my self that my shaking hands and trembling dissmay not expose to the World Weakness, folly and Weaknessess as groups as this, if I should live to advance Age, Reflections like these determine me at all Events to retire from the public Stage in good Season. Pray are our  Plymouth Friends become Frenchified as well as Anti federal. If they avow such Opinions as you hear, although I shall  never disturb their Repose, I shall never have any Confidence in them. But Doatage appears to me from every quarter among my old Friends. Our  are all well thro the Meazles as Col. Smith writes me and I hear from Travellers who have lately been entertained at that Hospitable House. May the Means as well as Disposition be long continued. You have lost  Letters from  the Hague and  London I doubt not in the late shipwrecks. I have none since that of the 30 of Septr. which I inclosed to you. We shall have a flood of News at once, by and by from  France,  Holland,  England and &c. I hope our Mass.

","My dearest Friend I have a secret to Communicate to Your Prudence. The  by Camillus was written in Concert between Hamilton, King and Jay. The Writings on the first ten Articles of the Treaty were written by Hamilton. The rest by King, till they came to the question of the Constitutionality of the Treaty, which was discussed by Hamilton. Jay was to have written a concluding Peroration: but being always a little lazy and perhaps concluding upon the whole that it might be most politick to keep his Name out of it, and perhaps finding that the Work was already well done he neglected it. This I have from Kings own mouth. It is to however for Hamiltons. All three consulted together upon most if not all the Pieces. Another Piece of History   of a very different kind. You knew Dr. Redman, the Manager of the Assembly. The smiling, the genteel, the well bred, the Gentleman like, the I dont know what. The Judge of some Court here. He went off this Morning in a stage in disgrace, to the southward.  This he choose rather than open his Veins Pro more Roma novum. Alass poor human nature! He has been slandered, with Imputations of something like what they call in  London Ladys Pillage -- of a very gross kind however -- with so much success, that a voluntary Banishment is considered as a very humane and  Punishment. I hate such subjects and therefore cannot and would not, if I could give you the details. I read forever, and am determined to sacrifice my Eyes like John Milton rather than give up the Amusement without which I should despair. If I did not with you consider the Universe as all one Family, I would never stay another day here. I have read four thick Octavo Volumes of Tacitus translated by Murphy, One thick Volume of Homers I had translate by Cowper, besides a multitude of Pamphlets and Newspapers, since I have been here. I dont write enough. The Habit of Writing should not be lost as I  it.  Peter Pindar has it right.  Search We the Spot which mental power contains? Go where Man gets his living by his Brains. If I had my Living by my Brains for seven Years past I should have had more mental Power. But Brains have not only been Useless but even hurtful and pernicious in my Course. Mine have been idle a long time -- till they are rusty. Dr. Bollman has given me an Account of his Intrigue to Liberate Fayette: for which I have heard a hint that he expects some office -- Entre nous -- But he will be disappointed. Fayettes disinterested unpaid services will cost Us very dear. Your son has already advanced to his Wife three hundred Guineas, Which I hope and suppose will be reimbursed to him. Mischief always and  often lurks under Pretensions and Professions of service without Pay.   With affections which No time nor    Space will abate  "

","My Dearest Friend I received yesterday  yours of 21.  and  25 Jan.  The Senate and House of  Massachusetts without any flights or flashes in their Answer to the Governors Speech  discovered a Gravity, Wisdom, Firmness and Dignity which as much to their honour as it is to the Consolation of the Sober and important Part of the Community and the humiliation of all the corrupt and distracted. I See daily so many affecting Proofs of the debilitating Power of Age, that I pity an old Man when he exposes himself. I had Yesterday a  in my own Chamber, which moved the tender feeling of my heart for a Friend advanced in Years, not many however beyond my own. I feel bold and Strong myself, tho my hands shake but my Age admonishes me to have a Care. It is devoutly to be wished that the  Massachusetts had a Governor capable of diffusing his Thoughts over fifteen seeing states and being their Dependences on each other as well as their Relations with foreign Nations. Mr. Adams cannot. His Pride and Vanity are vastly more extensive than his Abilities. He always had a contracted Mind --  a subtle and a bold one. He never was over honest nor over candid. He will lie a little for his own Vanity and more for his Party, and as much as a Spartan for his notions of the public good. Judge Cushing declines the Place of Chief Justice on Account of his Age and declining Health. Let not my Communications worry thee. I am unchangeably determined to serve Under no other than Washington. Telemachus says to the Suitors. 1. Odyssey. 490 &c. I am not averse From Kingly cares if Jove appoint me Such. I will not resist Jupiter. I will resign to his Will. If his Will is that any other should be president I know his Will also is that I should be a Farmer, for he has given me an understanding and a heart, which ought not and cannot and will not bow under Jefferson nor Jay nor Hamilton. It would be wicked in me. It would be countenancing Tyranny, Corruption and  in the People.   "
"Philadelphia  Feb. 6. 1796
","My Dearest Friend You say you have no desire to be the first, and I cannot say that it is desirable; but according to all present appearances you will either be the first or among the last in another thirteen months. I would not distress  to obtain the Priviledge of carrying an heavier Load than any of my fellow Labourers: but if the Fates destine one to attempt it it would be dastardly to shrink if it were in ones Power. The Question ought to be whether the Forces of Nature are adequate at this age. If They may possibly hold out one or two heats. I will not by any Pusillanimous Retreat thrown this Country into the Arms of a foreign Power, into a certain War and as certain Anarchy. If the People will do Such a Thing they shall have the undivided Glory of it. Judge Cushing has been wavering. Sometimes he would and  he would not be C. J. This will give the P. some trouble. Mr. Chase is a new Judge, but although a good 1774 Man his Character has a Mist about it of suspicion and Imperity which gives occasion to the Enemy to censure. He has been a warm Party Man, and has made many Ennemies. His Corpulency, which has increased very much Since I saw him last in  England, is  [illegible]   against his riding Circuits very long. I find none of our old Men very popular. Whether it is that old Parties their Ennemies have made unfavourable Impressions or whether the Youth who are rising up are desirous of shoving them out of the Way; or whether they have too much Vanity and too many Prejudices and wrong Notions to see the public Good  or whether all those Camps together have produced the Effect I know not. Mr. Brisler says he has had but thirty Dollars since last May. You must write me how this account stands and I will pay him up in March. No News from any Part of the World. All is stagnant Tranquility at present. I sent you a Porcupine by Mr. Martin Lincoln.  My Love and Duty as due.      "

","My Dearest Friend It is monday, the Time to expect the Eastern mail. Other Men have Letters -- I have none -- humiliated and mortified and at the same time irritated. I feel sometimes a disposition to abuse the Post Officers, sometimes to make a rash Vow never to Spend another Winter  from my Small Family that remains to me, but never once harbour a Suspicion that Madam may have omitted to write. Upon the whole however my health and Spirits have been better this Winter, than at any time since I had the Ague, a Blessing which I attribute to the free Use of my horse the last Summer. Health and Spirits and Leisure have revived my old Passion for Reading to such a degree as  diverting me from my usual Exercise of Walking when I cannot ride, allarms me for the Continuance of my Health. A gloomy Prospect moreover of four Months longer attendance upon Congress, aggravated by the Recollection  that a few days later than this, the last Year, on the 19 of February I got my Release and Liberty, makes a great defalcation from my Philosophical Serenity. While We are informed that you have Plenty of snow and fine sledding and , We have Weather as mild as April and streets as dirty as March. No further News of the Treaty or  else from  Europe. Business in Congress is languid as gaping and yawning as if Morpheus had  [illegible]   poured out all his soporifecks upon the two Houses. The Voice of Faction even is Scarcely heard. I suppose however when the Treaty comes he will lift up his Notes like a Trumpet. General Wayne has returned and enjoyed his . Judge Chace is here with the rest. Mr. Lee the Attorney General a Brother of our Friend the late Member of the House and of the late Governor of  Virginia, married to a Daughter of Richard Henry Lee is arrived with his Family. So is Mr. McHenry the Secretary at War. The offices are once more full.  But how differently filled, than when Jefferson, Hamilton, Jay &c. were here. The present Incumbent not being much thought of or at least talked of for President, Vice President, or substitute for both, the Public may be less disposed to fight for them or against them. The first situation is the great Object of Contention the Center and main source of all Gravitation as the learned Dr. Adams teaches in all his Writings, and  believes him tho nobody will own it. My Letters to You must never be seen by  else -and I ought here to caution you to be very careful and reserved in showing our sons Letters -- for thousands are watching for his halting, as well as mine and yours.

","My Dearest Friend Mr. Neckar in his Essay on the true Principles of Executive Power in great States, chapter 12, Says ""A Man, like myself, who has been Some Years placed in the Center of Public affairs, who has been one of the Axes round which the motions of personal Interest perform their Circuit, is best able to judge from his own Experience of the Activity of those Interests, and to perceive in what manner the human heart is influenced, irritated and Soothed by hope. Full often are the thoughts of Men employed upon their own personal Views, when they affect most carelessly to neglect or most generously to Sacrifice them. I grant that Individuals have for their Days of parade a pompous and wonder working Language; but I affirm, that, in their daily habits and in their Secret Confessions, We find them always occupied either with the fortune they are pursuing or the Eminence to which they aspire. It must not therefore be doubted that the more We narrow the Circle of Encouragement and Rewards which the Executive Power can bestow, the more We shall enfeeble the Action of it."" A Man, who like myself,  have been many more Years, than Mr. Neckar ever was, in the Center of Public Affairs   and that in a young Country which has ever boasted of its Simplicity, Frugality, Integrity, Public Spirit, public Virtue, Disinterestedness &c. can judge from my own Expressions of the Activity of Private Interest, and perceive in what manner the human heart is influenced, irritated and Soothed by hope. Neglect and Sacrifices of personal Interests are oftener boasted than practised. The Parade and Pomp and Ostentation and Hypocricy have been as common in  America as in  France. When I hear these Pretensions Sett up, I am very apt to Say to myself this Man deceives himself, or is attempting to deceive me. The various Elections of the  United States, will soon call forth all these Personal Interests in all their , and all the Acts of Dissimulation to conceal them. I am weary of the Game. Yet I dont know how I could live out of it. I dont love Slight, neglect, Contempt, disgrace nor Insult more than others. Yet I believe I have firmness of Mind enough to bear it like a Man, a Hero and a Philosopher. I might groan like Achilles and roll from Side to side, abed Sometimes at the Ignorance, Folly, Injustice and Ingratitude of the World. But I should be resigned and become more easy and chearful and enjoy myself and my Friends better than ever I did. Charles came upon me by  last Evening express from  N. York with the Alquine Treaty and Presents among which is the Sword with a Golden Scabbard. Col.

","My Dearest Friend I have only time to inform you that Monday and Thursday have passed away without bringing me a Letter from you. It is the first Week that has failed me in the whole  sometimes the Letters have not arrived on the proper day. There is a Dr. Somebody here from  Connecticut, who pretends, with an Instrument made of some kind of Metal or Composition of Metals by a sort of Mesmerism, rubbing or Stroking or   Conjuration, to cure Rhumatisms, Headacks, Plurisies And I know not what. Elsworth will not say that he believes in it: but he states facts and tells stories. I expect the heads of all the old Women (Males I mean, you know) will be turned. They have got him into the Presidents House among Some of his servants. And Mrs. Washington told me a story on Tuesday, before a Number of Gentlemen  so ineffably ridiculous that I dare not repeat it in Writing. The venerable Lady laughed as immoderately as all the rest of Us did.  is here in very fine health and very good Spirits. He goes to the supream Court 2 days and to Ricketts and the Theatre 2 Nights so that I have not so much of his Company as I could wish. A Barrier is erected between  Europe and  America. It Seems as if no  could get thro or over it. I went with  last night to the Drawing Room. As the Evening was fair and mild, there was a great Circle of Ladies and a greater of Gentlemen. General Wayne was there in Glory. This Mans Feelings must be worth a Guinea a Minute. The Pensulvanians claim him as theirs, and shew him a marked respect. We are now near the middle of  Last Year I left this Place on the 19th. Now I must stay thro the long months of March, April and May. Long! Nothing is long! The time will be soon gone and We shall be surprized to know what is become of it. How soon Will my Sands be all run out of the Glass: After sixty the Days and Hours have additional Wings  which they waive and beat with increasing Rapidity. Dr. Priestly is here. I drank Tea with him at the Presidents on Thursday  He says he always maintained against Dr. Price that Old Age was the pleasantest part of Life and he finds it so. I think so too. One knows not what Infirmeties may come on. What Pains, Griefs, or sorrows: I am determined to make my small Remainder as easy as I can and enjoy the Hours as they pass: but do a little good as I have Opportunity. You have not informed me whether you have let the Farms.   "

","My Dearest Friend This Morning I have  your  of the 3d.  which raised my Spirits again after the mortification of passing the whole of last Week without one. Benjamin has grown very dull. No Abuse. No lies, no Terrors, no , no Rant -- in comparison of what he used to have. The Subject which you think will excite all their feelings is well known to  in public Life, but is talked of by nobody: but in Confidence. I could name you however as good Federalists and as good Men as any, who think and say that he will retire and that they would, if they were he. And who would not? I declare upon my  I would. After 20 Years of such Service, with such Success, and with no Obligation to any one, I would retire before my Constitution failed, before my Memory failed, before my Judgment failed, before I should grow peevish and fretfull, irresolute or improvident. I would no longer put at hazard a Character so dearly earned at present to uncontaminated, but liable by the Weakness of Age to be impaired in a Moment.  He has in the most solemn manner Sworn, before many Witnesses at various times and on several occasions, and it is now by all who are in the Secret considered as irrevocable as the Laws of Meads and Persions. Your Comments to Knox were perfectly delicate and perfectly wise. You need not trouble to think of the subject. In my Opinion there is no more danger in the Change than there would be in changing a Member of the Senate and whoever lives to see it will own me to be a Prophet. If Jay or even Jefferson and one or the other it certainly will be, if it is not the next in Line if the Succession should be passed over, should be the Man, the Government will go on as well as ever. Jefferson could not stir a step in any other system than that which is Jay would not wish it. The Votes will run for three Persons -- two I have mentioned. The third being the Heir apparent will not probably be wholly overlook'd. If Jefferson and Jay are President and Vice President, as is not improbable, the other retires without Noise, or Cries or Tears to his farm. If either of those two are President and the other Vice President, he retires without Murmur or Complaint to his farm, forever. If this other should be P. and Jefferson or Jay V. President, four Years more if Life lasts, of Residence in  Philadelphia will be his and your Portion, after which Tie shall probably be desirous of imitating the Example of the present Pair: or if by reason of thoughts 
Page 3
 and Fortitude Eight Years should be accomplished, that is the Utmost Limit of time that I will ever continue in public Life at my rate. Be of good Courage therefore and tremble not. I see nothing to appall me and I feel no ill forebodings or faint Misgivings. I have not the Smallest dread of private Life, nor of public -- if private Life is to be my Portion my farm and my Mare shall employ the rest of my days. The Money of the Country the Paper Money is the most unpleasant Object I see. This must have a Remedy, and I fear it will be reserved for me to stem the Torrent, a worse one than the Western Rebellion or the opposition to the Treaty.   "

","My Dearest Friend The  Slip is Supposed to cast some Light on an interesting Subject. Arrangements for throwing off Care, of a private as well as public nature. I suppose his Plan is to pay off all his Debts and live upon the Income of the Remainder holding only his Mansion farm for Exercise and Amusement. This Plan is wise like all the rest. I cannot but approve his Resolution. Nor can any Man blame him. However We may all Wish for his longer Protection. I feel no  however for the Public. I am fully persuaded it will receive no detriment. For my self my Mind is as fully made up as his, and I dread nothing that can happen. If I loose my health I must retire in all Events. If my Health continues which at present thank God is pretty good, I shall either continue or retire at the Pleasure of the People, provided they do me Justice. Otherwise my Pen and my farm, will be irrevocably my sole Amusements for the Remnant of my days. I like young French very well. You did not name the other. "

","My Dearest Friend Last Year I took french Leave of  Philadelphia to go home. This Year I have the Mortification to think We are not half Way through the sessions. I see no Prospect of getting away before the middle of June. There is nothing new foreign or domestic. Electioneering begins to open her Campaign. The Letter from Jay in the  Pamphlet is called by the southern Gentlemen an Electioneering Letter. The Tracts in the inclosed Paper, are no doubt electioneering Tracts. If Washington continues I suppose Jefferson and Jay may both be set up for Vice President. If he renounces, they will be sett up for President and Vice President both, and let the Lot come out as it will. The Chief contest will be between those two according to present appearances. My Mind you know is made up and I am much at my Ease. I am impatient and distressed while my Mind is in . Once decided I have no longer any Uneasiness. It cannot be long before We shall have News from  Europe. My Mothers relief from her fears respecting her Arm is a great Pleasure to me. I hope to see her in good health in June. Have you given her my  of flour. You have had a fine season for your Wood. I hope you have hoarded enough to last the Year.   "

Mrs. Washington told me the last time I dined at the Presidents that Betcy Custis is to be married next Month, to Mr. Law the English  East India Nabob. The good Lady is as gay as a Girl and tells the story in a very  stile. Mr. Law says he is only 35 Years of Age and altho the Climate of  India has given him an older look Yet his Constitution is not impaired beyond his Years. He has asked Leave and a Blessing of The President and Mrs. W. He is to finish a House in the Faederal City and live there. He has two Children born in  India: but of whom is not explained. I told her I should write this to you and she prayed me to make an affectionate Remembrance of her. Nelly is with her sister Patcy at  Georgetown married to Mr. Peters son of a  Maryland Nabob. Thus you see that Fortune is the Object in our Country not Family. No that would be Aristocratical. Yesterday was  and a Parade there was. At Night a magnificent Ball which you will read in the News Papers. A thousand People in a vast Room a Circle of 80 feet Diameter. I have not  your favours of the 9  and  14th . Am glad the farms are disposed of.  "

You have had a fine Winter for Business and the snow still continue with you in admirable order for  sleighing and Sledding.  The Birthnight Ball was as splendid but no so elegant  as you have seen at  St. James's. I came off at ten without supper. The savages press through all Decorum in such a manner that I would not go. Some ladies were in danger. But none hurt I believe. The Spanish Treaty is arrived. But not yet laid before Us. Mrs. W. told Mrs. Cushing at Mrs. Boudinots that the print was  .

","My Dearest Friend I dined Yesterday with Mr. Madison. Mrs. Madison is a fine Woman and her two sisters are equally so: one of them is married to George Washington one of the two Nephews of the  who were sometimes at our House. Mr. Washington came and civilly enquired after your Health. These Ladies, whose Names were Pain, are of a Quaker Family once of  North Carolina. The Treaty with  Spain is arrived and is according to our Wishes. The Alpine Treaty is horridly Costly. It is worse than the British: but will not be so fiercely opposed. There is no  here for  Boston: I can not yet send any seeds. The great Affair is as it was. I hear frequent Reflections which indicate that , although in good hands he might do very well; yet in such hands as will hold him, he would endanger too much. Some Persons of high Consequence have spoken to me confidentially. But in general there is great delicacy on that head and I hold an entire reserve. The Question with me is between entire Ease and entire Disquietude. I will not fly from the latter nor will I court it. I can live as happily without a Carriage as Hamilton. Two great Political Questions have been agitated in the  Court. One about  Virginia Debts paid into the Treasury -- the other the Constitutionality of the Carriage Tax. Hamilton argued this last for three hours with his usual Splendor of Talents and Eloquence as they say. In the Course of his argument he said no Man was obliged to pay the Tax. This he knew by Experiment: for after having enjoyed the Pleasure of riding in his Carriage for six Years he had been obliged to lay it down and was happy. There is no hope of getting away till June. The House never went so slowly on.   "
"Phila  March 1. 1796
","My Dearest Friend Yesterday the President sent his Carriage for me to go with the Family to the Theatre. The Rage and the Spoiled Child were the two Pieces. It rained and the House was not full. I thought I perceived a little Mortification.  and his fine Lady were with Us. Yours of 21st.  gives me a Satisfactory Account of farming. I think I would engage Billings if I could. I must leave it to you to give him what you think fit. There is no  up for  Boston and Seeds are very Scarce and uncommonly dear. As to the Subject of  yours of the 20th . I am quite at my Ease. I never felt less Anxiety when any considerable Change lay before me. Aut transit aut finit. I transmigrate or come to an End. The Question is between living at  Phila or at  Quincy, between great Cares and Small Cares. I have looked into myself and see no meanness  nor dishonesty there. I see weakness enough. But no timidity. I have no concern on your Account but for your health. A Woman can be silent, when she will. After all, Persuasion may overcome the Inclination of the Chief to retire. But if it should, it will shorten his days I am convinced. His heart is set upon it, and the Turpitude of the Jacobins touches him more nearly than he owns in Words. All the studied Efforts of the , to counterballance Abuses by Compliments dont answer the End.  I suspect, but dont know, that Patrick Henry, Mr. Jefferson, Mr. Jay and Mr. Hamilton will all be voted for. I ask no questions: but questions are forced upon me. I have had some Conversations purposely Tonight, in order as I believe indeed as I know, to convince me, that the Faeds had no thoughts of overleaping the Succession. The only Question that  in my Mind is whether I shall retire with my Leader? I hate to live in  Phila in Summer and I hate still more to relinquish my farm. I hate Speeches, Messages, Addresses and answers, Proclamations and such affected, constrained Things. I hate Levees and Drawing Rooms. I hate to Speak to a 1000 People to whom I have nothing to say. Yet all this I can do. But I am too old to continue more than one or at  [illegible]   most more than two heats, and that is scarcely time enough to form contact and compleat any very useful system. Electioneering enough We shall have -- the enclosed Scraps will  specimens.   "

","My Dearest Friend I received this morning  your  of Feb. 22  -- the more agreable as it was not very confidently expected. I should be glad to see Mr. Copley.  brought the Treaty from Col. John Smith who brought it from  Lisbon. I hope you will have Letters by the Vessell you mention from  Rotterdam. The Treaties with  Spain and  Algiers have been unanimously Sanctioned by Senate and that with  Britain is proclaimed. The House will try to make a little Voice. Elsworth was this day nominated Chief Justice. I see that at  Boston and  Cambridge &c. the  was celebrated with great Splendor as it was here. The old song is verified as I always said it would be.  ""The more he is envied the higher hell rise."" Increase of abuse will produce an increase of Salutation. The Power of the P. may be too great to keep or to resign. If it is, he may meet with the Fate of Harley.  It is, Somehow, Strangely, the Opinion of many and among those are some of his best Friends that he ought to retire. No one, that I have head, has presum'd to say he would not if he were in the P.s case. He has now settled all Disputes with foreign Nations and may retire with  Glory. I find the V. P. toasted at most of the Feasts and even Brown has announced Mr. Adams's appearance at the Theatre with Pleasure. And this is as I conjecture Electioneering. The other Side will probably begin soon. And I shall regard it all with as much Apathy, as is in my nature. I feel collected and unmoved. The Principle of the Conclave goes a great Way in many Elections. All Parties will frequently  in the Choice of the oldest Cardinal, because he cannot hold the Papal Chair long. I am so old that they all know they can make me miserable enough to be glad to get out of it as soon as Washington if not in half the time. June is the earliest Month that gives a hope to release me. I suppose you must buy hay. You have not told me whether I am to expect a Colt. Am glad our Men are frugal of their English Hay.  "

","My Dearest Friend I Yesterday received the Letter  from my Son and in the Evening the President told me he had Letters from him. You will perceive the Prudence of reserving to yourself the print in his Letter to me, as every Thing of the Kind will be eagerly Seized and easily exaggerated. The Trustees are all ratified by the Senate and Yesterday Mr. Elsworths Nomination was consented to as Chief Justice, by which We  the clearest head and most dilligent hand We had. It will give a Nobility to the Government however, to place a Man of his Courage, Constancy, fortitude and Capacity in that situation. The Nomination of Mr. Chase had given Occasion to uncharitable Reflections and Mr. Wilson's ardent Speculations had given offence to some, and his too frequent affectation of Popularity to others. Though Elsworth has the Stiffness of  Connecticut: though His Air and Gilt are not elegant: though He cannot enter a Room nor retire from it with the Ease and Grace of a Courtier: Yet his Understanding is as sound, his Information as good and his heart as steady as any Man can boast. The Newspapers  in my sons Letter were no later than the date of it and contain nothing but what has been already detailed in our own Newspapers. The  done to the President on his Birth Day have been very magnificent. At  Boston and  Cambridge very striking. Here it was all Dance  and Glare. I suppose the Remembrance of the V. P. on those occasions considering that for the most part they forget him is with a View to the Reelection approaching. Last Night a Gentleman at a Dinner interrogated another who is of an opposite Party to him, to know who they intended to propose or set up for V. P. instead of Clinton. The Answer was I dont know but I believe Mr. Langdon. There is very little indeed nothing said in my Hearing concerning an illustrious Resignation. Nobody speaks to me and I speak to nobody of it. As it is easier to enter a Room with Ease, Confidence and Propriety than it is to go out of it and as it is easier to stand before an  in your front than in your Rear, as it is easier to attack a fortress than it is to lie still and be attacked, Resignation, Retreat and Retirement will be found more difficult than Acceptance. To hold an office a Year with a full and known Resolution to resign, to adhere without wavering to that Resolution and then retire with Grace and Applause is the most difficult Part to act which he has ever under taken. A few Months will shew Us the fermentation that this Idea will Occasion and the Addresses which will be made to his Passions to change his Mind. It will be amusing to observe these Things. Idolatry is as growing a Thing as ambition or Avarice. And the  [?]which have lately been offered to the Shrine have increased the Devotion of the Worshippers. Priestley preached last sunday a sermon on the Religious Rites of the Gentiles in which he exposed their Nakedness like an European to the Blushes  and Mortification of American hearers of both sides.

","My Dearest Friend I have made the necessary Inquiry concerning Seeds And have found the Price so extravagant that I have concluded it imprudent to purchase any for  Beal, Dr. Welsh, Mr. Dexter, Dr. Tufts or myself. And I desire you to purchase or request Dr. Tufts to purchase for me one hundred and twenty Pounds of Clover Seed. The Second Crop of Clover, from which alone they thresh the Seeds in  Pensilvania, fell short the last Season in Such a manner, that there is little at Market and none under a Price so exorbitant that it would be folly to purchase it - from 20 to 24 dollars a Bushell of about 60 pound Weight. The Traders have written to  New England, and a great deal of trash will be imported here from thence: but We may as well purchase at home, as purchase our own seeds here and send them home. My Health has been better this Winter than in any one since I had the Fever and Ague. This Happiness  I attribute to the free Use of my Horse, the last Summer. But I begin to feel the Want of Exercise, and to fear that the Spring will incommode me. A dreary Prospect of three months more to be wasted here, in doing little or nothing, vexes me sore, but what cannot be curd must be endured. I Sometimes think that I am  in vain and Spending my Life for nought, in a fruitless Endeavour to preserve a Union that being detested on both Sides cannot long last. But I shall persevere, as long as I can to do all I can to preserve a Compact which is useful and might be more so, if the Pride of Aristocracy, and its Malice against all Superiority did not Stand in its own Light as it always did and always will. Bodies of Gentlemen Act with as little Union and as little Wisdom as Bodies of Ladies or Bodies of Simplemen or Bodies of Mob. The Spark, whether it be in the flint or the Steal, never comes out but by Collision. Indeed a Spark is a drop or Particle of melted, red hot iron. The Spark is in the Iron then but it can be stricken out only by the blows of the flint. Let the Wisdom then be in the Gentlemen if you will -- it will never fly out -- it will never give light till it be Smitten by the flint, or the Mass. But why do I write Pedantical Lectures to you? Because I have nothing else to say.   "

","My Dearest Friend I received on Monday  your two  of 28. Feb.   I am very glad you employed Pratt to cutt the Timber, for it is high time I had a Barn to shelter my Hay that the Cattle may not complain of it so much, as they do this Year, with Justice. I shall build only the shell this Year. Raise the Barn and Board and shingle it. The limed Manure upon the Hill I mean to have Spread upon the Grass Ground where it lies. I join Copland in his Request that the Thatch Bank may be let to either French or Burrell. Priestley preaches once on a Sunday to a  Congregation, on the Evidences of Religion and is much admired.  I sent your Message to Mrs. Green. Alas! Poor ! But his Father and his Mother too know what it is, to be cooped up  in Taverns Waiting for Winds. Aye and the Boy too has had more Experience of it than a Million of old Men. Many a Week and many a Month as he been detained with me waiting for Winds and Waves and ships both political and Physical. He has resources within to amuse and employ him. I dont believe All the Points of Rochefaucaults Thought. Ambition and Love live together very well. A Man may be mad with both at once. Witness Caesar and Anthony with Cleopatra and many others. If the Young Man really loves, I will not thwart him. I have been anxious lest my sons by early and indiscreet connections should embarrass themselves and Companions in Poverty, Distress and Misery from which it would not be in my Power to relieve them. I have seen Instances enough to Ruin from early Marriage. Azariah Falen and Sam Quincy were two among many. The  has been celebrated very sufficiently. I have much doubt of the Propriety of these Celebrations. In Countries where Birth is respected and where Authority goes with it, there is congruity enough in such Feast: But in Elective Governments the Question is more doubtful. Probably the Practice will not be continued after another Year. In the Case you suppose, Blair McClenican Swears with great oaths before Giles and all of them that he will vote for no  and no other Man, but his old Friend of 1775. But there is no Certainty of any Change more than there has been for six months. Every Body takes it for granted there will be. But my Opinion is it will kill the Resigner.   "

","My Dearest Friend Why! This is very clever. Every Monday and every Thursday brings me regularly a Letter, which Softens the Taedium Vitae. The Ennui of Life, in this Wrangling  Metropolis. So! We are to have a  Quincy Academy! With all my Heart. I am willing to Pay my Quota of the . But Something more than a School House will be wanting for so desirable a Purpose. Oh that I had a Bosom to lean my Head upon: But how dare you hint or Lisp a Word about Sixty Years of Age. If I were near, I would soon convince you that I am not above forty. I allow in full, all your Claim to Merit Sufferings and Sacrifices, and if it would not be ridiculed would set up mine as high, and vow that no Man in  America not even W. has Suffered half so much or done more. Thus you and I have equal Variety and Vanity is as good a Pretension as any that prevails. Why says Johnson should not Truth be believed by a Man concerning himself, since the Mind loves Truth. He would call it conscious Dignity and self Esteem. Candid Minds who admit the Truth will make the Excuse. But greater Numbers will deny the Truth and make it not only a folly but a Crime. Therefore Let Us hold our Tongues. The House of Representatives have hastened on the British Treaty with all their Teeth and all their Nails. Individuals will bite like savages, and tear like Lions. There will be a desperate Effort of a Party which seems to think and perhaps partly that their Power depends entirely on the Destruction of that Instrument. The Business of the Country in many important Departments stands still and suffers for Want of attention, which is all absorbed by the Debates on the Treaty and will continue to be so for several Weeks. Many Persons are very anxious, and forebode a Majority , and the most pernicious and destructive Results. I cannot yet believe that they will be so desperate and unreasonable. If they should be, what is to come next I know not. It will be then evident that this Contribution cannot Stand. I pray you to  no Mercy to the Canker Worms. Engage another hand as soon as you please. I hope you will take good Care of your Health, for the sake of your Husband, your Children, your other Friends and I will add of your Country. There's Gallantry for you. As to the Country however, if the H. of R.s condemn the Treaty and defeat its operation, I see nothing but a Dissolution of Government and immediate War. President, Senate and House all dissolve, and an old Congress revives. Debts are all cancelled. Paper Money issued and passed into Circulation by the Bayonette and in short Heaven and Earth set at . I envy the tranquil Lives of a Cranch and a Tufts and an Unkle Norton. Yet I am merry enough.

","My Dearest Friend I dined Yesterday with Mr. Burr, who lives here in Style. A Number of Members of the House, The Speaker, Mr. Dayton among the Rest. It Seems to be the general Opinion that the House will express some Opinions  to the Treaty: but finally carry it into Effect. There is a good deal of Apprehension expressed for the Union, in Conversation. Some think and Say it cannot last. Such is the Repugnance between the East and the West. The Death of my Aunt Hunt, for by that Name it is most natural for me to call her, is an Event that was every Day be expected, and   as her days of Usefullness and Satisfaction were past can be no Cause of rational Grief to her nearest Relations: it has not however failed to revive the Remembrance of the Scaenes of my Youth, of my Father, my Unkles, my Aunt, and my Cousins many of whom were gone before her, and to affect me with many tender sentiments and serious Reflections.  Alass she was little more than thirty Years older than myself. I shall never see her Years. But why should I regret such a Prospect as that. Although I am convinced that human Life is an happy and agreable Scaene, a charming delightful state, upon the whole, and although my share of it has been checquared with Perplexities, Difficulties, Dangers and Distresses which fall to the Lott of but few, yet it has been Sweet and happy on the whole, and calls for Gratitude to my maker and Preserver; Yet every Year according to my Opinions and Perceptions and Expectations brings me nearer to a State of superiour Excellence and more Enjoyment, when I hope to meet all my Relations and other Friends who may have done their Duty in this. There my Dearest Friend may We meet and never be again seperated by any Necessities to go to  Europe or  Philadelphia or elsewhere. My Duty to  and congratulate her on the Recovery of her Arm. I hope to see her again in June. But the H. of R. will keep me here as long as possible. Your Emanuensis improves in her . She superscribes your Letters elegantly. My Love to her. I am not sorry that John went to  England. He will have Opportunities of Improvement and gaining Information there.   "

","My Dearest Friend I covet the Harp of Amphion. What would I not give for the Harp of Amphion? In my Walks in the  Grove, in Rocky run and on  Pens hill, I should play upon my Lyre and the merry Rocks would dance after me, and reel into Walls. This would be to me a very pleasant and profitable private Amusement. But there is another Use I could make of my Instrument in my public Employment more grateful to a benevolent  Heart because more Useful to Mankind. In no Age of the World was it more wanted. ! I am not an Amphion. I have been thirty years Singing and whistleing among my Rocks and not one would ever move without Money. I have been Twenty Years, Saying if  not Sings, preaching if not  [illegible]   playing. But an uncomplying World will not regard my  Uncouth Discourses. I cannot Sing nor play. If I had Eloquence or Humour or Irony or Satyr or the Harp or Lyre of Amphion, how much good could I do to the World: What a Mortification to my Vanity: What a humiliation to my self Love? The Rocks in our H. of R. will not dance to my Lyre. They will not accord to a well  State. They will not endure the Harmony that Springs from Sacred Union and consent of Things. They are for breaking all the Instruments but of the thorough Bass and then blowing you deaf and dumb. There are bold and daring strides making to demolish  [illegible]   the P., Senate and all but the House, which as it seems to me must be the Effect of the Measures that many are Urging. Be not alarmed however. They will not carry their Point. The Treaty will be executed and that by the Consent of the House.  I am going to hear Dr. Priestley. His Discourses are learned, ingenious and Useful. They will be printed, and He says dedicated to me. Dont tell this secret though, for no other being knows it. It will get me   the Character of an Heretick I fear. I presume however, that dedicating a Book to a Man, will not imply that he approves every Thing in it. The Weather is so fine, that I long to be upon my Hills. Pray since my Harp cannot build Walls, how do my Friends go on who are obliged to employ their Elbows in that laborious Work? Has Dr. Tufts begun to build the Line that Newcomb did not engage for? Those Walls must be  or Burrells Corn field will not be safe. I Sometimes think, that if I was in the H. of R. and could make Speeches there I could throw some Light upon these Things. If  should be president, I believe I must put up, as a Candidate for the House. But this is my Vanity. I feel sometimes as if I could Speechify among them, but alass, alass, I am too old. It would soon destroy my Health. I declare, however, if I were in that House I would drive out of it some Daemons that haunt it. There are false Doctrines and false Jealousies predominant there at times that it would be easy to exorcise. You see I mind no order in what I write to you.   "

","My Dearest Friend Your delicious Letter of the 5th.  came to my hand Yesterday. Your beautiful and pathetic Reflections on the Match in our Presidential Family are such as I expected. It is to me, one of the most delightful Ideas that is treasured in my Mind, that my Children have no Brothers nor sisters of the half or quarter Blood. One such Consciousness would poison all the Happiness of my Life.  ""Remembered Follies, Sting,"" and none could  pierce my heart with such corrosive and deleterious Poison as this. I am so disgusted with this kind of Life that I am sometimes disposed to make rash Resolutions that I never will live another Winter out of my family. Pray what is become of your new ? Is it possible to afford to have it built? Is it not vexatious? Have We not plagues enough? Must our own Friends conspire to torment Us? Is Imprudence and Turbulence so entailed upon Us, that Members of the widest Bodies must conspire with their own ? Here is a Folly complained of in the House by Baldwin. The  Georgia Speculation is in  a fair Way to rid the World for what I know of some of the Hairbrains. But why should wise, honest and independent Men run wild? Jackson has had a Rencontre, and Gun has sought one. The Bostonians have been the Dupes. Sobrius esto. Be Sober. Be Calm, oh my heart and let your Temperance and moderation be known to all Men. But it requires a great command of ones Passions to be Serene amidst such Indiscretions and  of wise Men when We have so much Extravagance of the Unwise. And so much Malice of the wicked to contend with at the same time. I believe I told you that  was become quite a Negotiator at  the Hague, and his Brother in  London. The latter however will return, I suppose to  Holland upon the Return of Mr. Pinckney to  England. Mr. Gore and Mr. Short I conjecture will be appointed Commissioners to estimate depredations and Damages and perhaps  may be named one of the two who are to be by Lot converted into a 3d. But all this must be Secret. I am trying your Capacity to keep secrets, you see. "

","My Dearest Friend The Debate on the Treaty continues and will continue three or four Weeks I suppose. I know not whether We shall rise before next March: for if the House refuse to comply with the Treaty, the Senate will not consent to rise till they do. Upon the whole however I hope the House will do what is necessary and let Us go home in June. The Constitution I hope will in time be understood. So many Speeches and Writings to explain it, should not be lost. I cannot send you the Work you wrote for. It is no where to be had. It is said that Mr. Burr will certainly be ousted and General Schuyler chosen. Mr. Robinson of  Vermont is also said to be out of all hopes.

The Violence of the North West Wind which has thrown down Chimneys and blown off Roofs in this City, We suppose has prevented the Eastern Mail from crossing the  North River and deprived me of my Thursdays Letter as yet. I hope it will come . A Thousand and one Speeches have been made in the H. of Reps. upon the Motion for petitioning the P. for Papers. Twenty complete Demonstrations have been made of the Constitutionality of it, and twenty more of its Unconstitutionality. Ten of its Expectancy and as many of its Inexpectancy, five of its Utility and the same number of its Inutility.

My  [?] is pretty severe, especially in cold Weather. This Wind will delay Intelligence from  Europe for ten days or a fortnight. Liancourt is doing with Elsworth and Tellerand talks of embarking for  Hambourgh. Having no Horse and reading more and walking less than Usual I am solicitous about my health. The Birds in Numbers and Vanity began to sing and the grass to grow green before this last Gripe of Queen Mab. The poor Birds have hard times now. The two Miss Daltons have been here all Winter. I delivered Your Message to Mrs. Green and General Wayne. I cannot see a ray of Hope, before June. If the House should be frenzical We must sit till next March and leave it to the People to decide by choosing a new President, Senate and House, who will harmoniously go all lengths, call George a Tyrant to his face. The English Nation Pyrates break the Treaty, enter into an alliance offensive with  France and go to War, with spirit, Consistency and Dignity. But I believe the House will adopt the Language which says that the Just keep their Promises though they have made them to his hurt and that they must make the best of a bad bargain and come off thus as well as they can by abusing Jay, President and Senate and Treaty without pretending to annul it.

It is a Curse to be surrounded with fools from ones own Country who always give more trouble than all the rest as I have long experienced and my son now experiences.

","My Dearest Friend On Wednesday I dined with Mr. Russell the Friend of Dr. Priestley and while We were at Table, in came large Packets of Letters and Newspapers from  England. The Ladies at Table had Letters from their friends and the  was so lively so much like what I had often felt that it put me into very good humour. The News was what you will see in Fennos Paper. Yesterday I dined at the  with Ministers of State and their Ladies foreign and Domestic. After dinner the Gentlemen drew off after the Ladies and left me alone with the President in close Conversation. He detained me there till Nine o Clock and was never more frank and open upon Politicks. I find his Opinions and sentiments are more like mine than I ever knew before, respecting  England and  France and our American Parties. He gave me Intimations enough that his Reign would be very short. He repeated it three times at least, that this and that was of no Consequence to him personally, as he had but a very little while to stay in his present situation. This must be a confidential secret.  I have hinted it to no one here. The  told me he had that day received three or four Letters from his new Minister in  London, one of them as late as 29 of December. Mr. Pickering informs me, that Mr. Adams modestly declined a Presentation at Court but it was insisted on by Lord Granville: and accordingly he was presented to the King and I think the Queen and made his Harrangues and received his answers. By the Papers I find that Mr. Pinkney appeared at Court on the 28th. of January: after which I presume Mr. Adams had nothing to do but return to  Holland. The Appearances of Peace are as yet but faint. The H. of R.s have applied for Papers and the  has their Request under Consideration. He is not at all pleased with this. A Motion is now before the H. made by Mr. Harper that it be resolved that Provision be made to carry into Execution all the Treaties yet published. How long this will be debated I know not. There is danger that the Delay on our Part will occasion delays on the Part of  Britain, but I hope not. Three of our Reps., Lyman, Dearborne and Varnum voted against all  New England  except one I believe in  Vermont. The Loss of Mr. Ames and Mr. Dexter has been much lamented.  Varnum and Lyman and Dearborne are as inveterate as Giles, by all that I hear. I have not yet seen my sons public Letters. There is such  of Party that the Prospect of a Change in Administration quite cures me of all Desire to have a share in it. Repose and Poverty I say. Yet I am not intimidated. Renegadoes and Adventurers from foreign Countries acquire such an influence among the People although there is no Attachment in their Nature to Us or our Country and there is every Reason to suspect the worst Influence over them: and sensible People are so fearful of provoking their Wrath and Imprudence by exposing them that it is really disgusting to enter on any public stage. The People are so abused and deceived and there is so little Care or Pains taken to undeceive and disabuse them that the Consequences must be very disagreable.    "

","My Dearest Friend On Monday I received  your  of the 20th . Nothing will damp the Rage for Speculation but a Peace which may break a few hundreds or thousands of speculators. The  Georgia Business is Impudence of uncommon hardness. The Rage of Party is there unrestrained by Policy or Delicacy. Our sons Account of shakespears  Fenno has printed with out Names. He must early learn to bear Mortifications. He will never have more to bear than his Father has borne. He is in a state of  Banishment. I wish he would come home, with leave, and have Courage enough to set down again in his office and go before Justices of the Peace and Quarter sessions in Defence of the Rights of Man, after marrying his Girl if she is still disengaged if he likes it. Upon the whole however I think he had better stay another Year, which will make great Changes in this  as well as other Countries. The Appointment of the C. J. was a wise Measure. My Mind is quite at ease on that subject. Buy as much Hay as You please. I was afraid you would be obliged to give more than five Pounds a load. The Barn is to be forty five feet long or rather exactly of the Dimensions of my Fathers. I think it must be in a line with that. If you make an Ell you  off all the Prospect. I shall only raise board and shingle it this year -- merely for a shelter to the Hay. I send you a Post Note for 600 which I wish you to acknowledge by the first Opportunity. My  are so enormous that I can send no more. The House consume all their Time upon Party  and all the Great Business of the Nation is suspended. Mr. Henry of  Maryland exclaimed to me  with great Pathos.  ""Pensilvania has passed a Law to appoint Electors by a general or state Ticket. The Point will lay with  Pensilvania. They are  wrong and We shall be defeated."" Bingham answered  ""Oh No"" We shall have every Man."" I held my Tongue and understood not a Word they said. Henry poor Man had not taken laudanum enough to raise his spirits to the Key. The Heart is deceitful and I do believe as well as suspect that I know not mine: But I really and soberly feel as if I should be better pleased that Henry my sincere friend should be defeated than that he should . Torment and  Philadelphia are in one state. Quiet and  Quincy in the other. That is all the Difference. I feel myself as fixed as fate. Our statesmen have Letters from  which I have not seen: but which please, entertain and interest them. I am my dearest friend poor or sick, great or small    "
"Philadelphia  April 1. 1796
","My Dearest Friend The Newspapers will inform you of our interminable Delays. The House have asked for Papers and the President has refused them, with Reasons and the House are about to record in their Journals their Reasons. Meanwhile the Business is in : and I have no clear Prospect when I shall go home. It is the general Opinion of those I converse with that after they have passed the Resolutions which they think will justify them to their Constituents, Seven or Eight of the Majority will vote for the appropriations necessary to carry the Treaties into Execution. Next Wednesday is assigned for the House to take the P.s Message into Consideration. Two  Massachusetts Members Leonard and Freeman are gone home and three are among the most inveterate of the Opposition Dearborne, Varnum and Lyman. Our People are almost as inconsistent in returning such Men as the Pensilvanians are in Returning Adventurers from  Geneva,  Britain and  Ireland. If the Constitution is to give Way under these contending Parties We shall see it before long. If the House persevere in refusing to vote the appropriations We shall sit here till next March for what I know and wait for the People, to determine the Question for Us.  One good Effect of a persevering Opposition in the House would be that We should preserve the President for another four Years: for I presume He will have sufficient Spirit to hold the Helm till he has steered the ship through this storm, unless the People should remove him which most certainly they will not. I will not sit here in summer in all Events. I would sooner resign my Office. I will leave  Philadelphia by the Sixth or seventh of June at farthest. Other Gentlemen of the Senate and House are frequently asking Leave of Absence: but my Attendance is perpetual and will if continued much longer disorder my Health, which hitherto has been very good. But I want my Horse, my farm, my long Walks and more than all the Bosom of my friend. Poor Lear has lost his second Wife. I want to talk  with my Brother and to know how his Patriotic Pulse beat in these times. Next Monday is your Election when I suppose there will be a Stir. Many Letters express a clear Opinion that there will be a Change. This would be the strongest Proof of  which  Mass has ever given; because I suppose it will be from faederal Principles and Motives. But I expect no such Thing. I could fill a sheet with my Reasons but they would not be new to you. The Weather is very pleasant but rather dry. I suppose you have Scarcely got rid of your snow.

His Correspondence with the Office of State has been Satisfactory. He must meet with his little Disappointments but he has had an Opportunity to see that proud Court and King and that prouder People if possible. Their Behaviour is so insolent as to be hard to bear. But our People are not much behind them. Your  is chosen. Who is he. My faith is that the old Patrioch will stand his Ground. But he deserves to be left out for his Childish Turbulence.

It is now avowed by Mr. Bond, the British Charge D'Affairs that the Surrender of the Posts is suspended upon the determination of the H. of R. and who could expect it would be otherwise? I have read ""The Ministers"" dispatches from  London. The King could not help discovering his old ill . The Mad Ideots will never recover. Blunderer by Nature, Accidents are all against him. Every Measure of his Reign has been wrong. It seems they dont like Pinkney. They think he is no Friend to that Country and too much of a French Jacobin. They wanted to work up some Idea or other of introducing another in his Place: but our young Politician saw into them too deeply to be duped. At his last Visit to Court the K. passed him without Speaking to him, which you know will be remarked by Courtiers of all Nations. I am glad of it: for I would not have my son go so far as Mr. Jay and affirm the friendly Disposition of that Country to this. I know better. I know their Jealousy, Envy, Hatred and Revenge covered under pretended Contempt. I am so fatigued and disgusted with the Insipidity of this dull Life that I am half a Mind to vow that if  dont Resign I will. The Old Hero looks very grave of late. However there is a high Probability that I am upon my last Year of public Life, for if there should not be a Choice by the People I will not suffer a Vote to be given for me in the H. of R. I will never Serve in that high and Responsible situation without some foundation of People to stand on. If I should be chosen V. P. only by a Plurality I will refuse. In short there are so many probable Cases in which I am determined to retire that the Probability of it is upon the whole very strong. Indeed, I feel  to be a fool to serve here at all. I am glad you can cast off the fret upon your Mind. You received some Post Note soon after the date of  Yours of 28 of March  which enabled you to face your Creditors and gave you more Courage I hope. The Walls in Curtis's Pasture must be built, or Burrells Corn will not be safe. Cleopatra ought not to be fed too high. She should have no Grain, only Hay.   "

","My Dearest Friend I dined on Monday at the  with young La Fayette and his Preceptor, Tutor or Friend, whatever they call him, whose Name is Frestel. I asked Them with Mr. Lear to break fast with me this Morning and they agreed to come: but last Evening Mr. Lear came with a Message from The President, to ask my Opinion whether it would be advisable for  [illegible]  the young Gentlemen, in the present Circumstances of his Father and Mother and whole Family and considering his own tender Years, to accept Invitations and mingle in Society? Whether it would not too much interrupt his studies? The Youth and his Friend had proposed these Questions to the P. and asked his Advice, and expressed their own opinion that Retirement would be more advisable and more desirable. I Agreed in opinion with the  and his Guests and as I had been the first who had invited them, at the P's request agreed to excuse them from accepting my Invitation that they might have it to say as a general Apology that they had accepted none. There is a Resemblance of Father and Mother in the young Man. He is said to be studious and discreet. I hope he will live to become a respectable and a more fortunate Man than his father.  You must have known him at five or six Years of Age as well as his sister Anastasia who is now with her Parents. The Majority of The H. of R. appear to be resolute to do Nothing. In fact they have done nothing and Mr. Giles boasts that he has a Majority of ten determined to do nothing, concerning the Treaty with  England. For my own Part, I see nothing better than a Crisis working up, which is to determine whether the Constitution is to be brought to   its End this Year, or last a few longer. Not The Tavern at  Cowes not the Tavern at  Harwich or at  Helvoet not the Taverns at  Nantes,  L'Orient and  Breast nor the Calms, Storms and contrary Winds of a long Voyage at sea, nothing but a Journey through  Spain from  Ferrol to  Fanterrabbia is more tedious than the operations of our Government under this Constitution. I have received  yours of April 1 . You must get  as reasonably as you can. But I almost wish We had let our Homestead upon shares as well as the others. Another Year I will, if I dont stay at home to take Care of it. My love to Brother Cranch. It is not his old Asthma that afflicts him I hope. The Secretary of the Treasury had Letters Yesterday from  only upon Business.   "
"Philadelphia  April 16. 1796
","My Dearest Friend The Doctor may have the Steers if he wishes to have them. The People of the  United States are about to be Stirred up in every quarter of the Union. The H. of R. are determined to go all Lengths. The Merchants of this City have had the most numerous Meeting that has been known for a long time and unanimously voted to Petition that The Faith, The  and the Interist of the Nation may be preserved. They have appointed Committees to correspond with the Merchants in all the seaports. I expect that the Citizens will also be called together in the State House Yard and it is said that the Gentlemen will turn out: but the Event will be doubtfull. The State Parties will all be agitated and Party Spirit will be carried to the highest Pitch. It must be a national Determination, and if the nation solemnly determines upon War and Confusion they ought not to charge it to the Government. These initial Situations are familiar to me and I always feel calmest in the midst of them. A few Outlandish Men in the H. have taken the lead and Madison, Giles and Baldwin are humble followers. If the Voice of the Nation should be finally and decidedly in  of the Treaty, there will be a mortified Party so bitter, rancorous and desperate, fomented by foreign Influence, in opposition that the Government will be very much embarrassed, and the public service very uncomfortable. When I take a Walk out of Town and see the young clover beautifully starting I long to see my own. Pray how fares it? I have always thought it injudicious to make any Attempt against the Governor, knowing as I do the habitual Attachment to him, as well as the difficulty of uniting People in another. The Countenance he gives to a very profligate Party is very pernicious to the Public but he is stimulated to it in Part by the Opposition to him, and he would not do less out of Office. The Constitution of our Government is  to create, excite and support perpetual Parties in the States, mixing and crossing alternately with Parties in the federal Govt. It will be a perpetual Confusion of Parties. I fear We do not deserve all the Blessings We have within our Reach and that our Country must be deformed with Division, Contests,  and civil Wars as well as others. As the People of  Rome Scrambled for Power against their Senate: as the People of  Athens Scrambled for more Power than was reserved to them by the Laws of Solen as the People of  Carthage Scrambled for Power against their Senate as the People of  England Scrambled for Power against the K. and Lords and set up Oliver as the People of  France Scrambled for Power against every Majority and set up Robespierre. So the H. of R. of the U. S. will Scramble for Power against the P. and Senate. And the frequency of popular Elections will corrupt all before them. May God of his infinite Mercy grant that some Remedy may be found before it be too late in the good sense of this People. Mr. Cabot desires me  ""to present you his most profound Respects not daring to send by an Husband any more affectionate Regard.""   "
"Philadelphia  April 19. 1796
","My Dearest Friend The Sensations of  19. 1775 and those of this Morning have some Resemblance to each other. A Prospect of foreign War, and civil War in conjunction is not very pleasant. We are a poor divided Nation in the midst of all our Prosperity. The H. of R. after debating 3 weeks about asking for Papers are now beginning another Discussion which may last as long on the Merits and Demerits of the Treaty. If the H. refuse to make the Appropriations it is difficult to see how We can avoid War and it is not easier to find out how we can preserve this Government from Dissolution. We must however coolly and patiently Study and Search for the Means and References which may be left to avoid War and support Government. Mr. Swift and Mr. Goodhue have Spoken ably   in favour of the Treaty: and Mr. Nicholas and Mr. Giles Spoke more moderately against it than was expected. I had no Letter from you Yesterday. Brisler says the Mail goes now 3 times a Week on Tuesdays, thursdays and Saturdays. I shall  to write by each, tho it may be but a Line of Remembrance. I hope your Indisposition was not  [illegible]   a grave one: but the omission of a Letter Yesterday gave me some fears. I cannot deny the Right of the H. to ask for Papers, nor to express their opinions upon the Merits of a Treaty. My Ideas are very high of the Rights and Powers of the H. of R. These Powers may be abused and in this instance there is great danger that they will be. Such a Combination of Party Motives as Debts,   Antifederalism and French Influence, seldom occurs to overawe the Members and lead them into Party Violence. But the Faith and Honour of the Nation are pledged, and tho the H. cannot approve they ought to feel themselves bound. Some Persons still think the H. will comply. But there is an Inveteracy and Obstinacy on this occasion as I scarcely ever Saw. The Pride of Madison, Giles, Baldwin, ill brooking the  Powers of the Senate, Emulating the Dignity and Lustre of Members of that Body, ardently struggling to Rival an Elsworth, a King &c. These are feelings that our Lawgivers in framing our Constitution did not advert to. The Elections of the two Houses by such different Bodies as the People and their Legislators, will always leave this difficulty in full force. The Leading Members of the House such as Madison and Baldwin should have been e'er now Senators. But I must not Speculate. I must come to something more pleasing,    "
"Phila.  April 21. 1796
","My Dearest Friend This Day seven Years I first took my seat in Senate and I hope I shall not sit there seven Years longer. The H. continues constant -- some Conjecture that by one means or another they will comply after some time: but I see no present Appearance of it. I pray with you for the Prosperity of Lion but that is all I can do. The Town of  Boston is under a bad Influence in the House of unwise and I fear Unupright Conductors. The despicable Story of St. Hillaire, I have learned from Charles but the Event upon Smith I had not heard. It is the Decree of Fate that I should be connected by two Branches with a weak Family and I must make the best of it. Nothing can happen from it worse than my fears and long Expectations. I am determined it shall not plague me. As to Copeland He knows that my Contract with him was for 8 Dollars a Month for the Year and I told him expressly I would give him no more. If you can have Billings, I dont desire any other. You may let even the  to the Halves if you will. I will let out the home Place for the future all but the House and Gardens. I am determined to reduce my Family at  Quincy, and do nothing at farming but occasionally. I am glad the Hill is cross . I expected it would be worse in the Spring than it was in the fall. You must buy Hay if it is wanted: but there must have been Waste. I shall fat two Yoke of Oxen upon the  . I shant keep more than one Yoke at home and a Yoke of others perhaps. You call your Letters a Jumble but they are my Delight and mine are not half as good as Yours. Our Constitution is coming to a Crisis. I calculated at its Commencement about ten Years for its duration. The People will this summer have to determine whether it shall Survive its Eighth Year. The H. of R. seem determined to dictate to the whole  and  Virginia is equally desirous of dictating to the H. and thro the Ignorance, Weakness and Wickedness of  Boston, New York and  Philadelphia she is but too successfull.    "
"Phil.  23. Ap. 96
","My Dearest Friend Mr. Brisler desires me to request you to let his Wife have ten dollars. I would  it, but I suppose it is hardly worth while. The H. of R. is as  as ever according to all Appearances. When the Question will be taken I know not. They have no  for their Country. Three  Mass. Men are among the most obstinate and obdurate. I believe it will be best to excuse Copeland from the service but I leave it to you to do as you think best.  "
 April 24. 1796,"My Dearest Friend I have received in  your  of 15 . an entertaining Account of Virtogern and Rowena. Our  is mired, to the Axletree in a Bog, and unable to advance or retreat. The People only can draw it out: but whether it will be backwards or forwards I know not. The Horses upon  Portland still employed to draw up Hill are so equally matched with the Load and those before that the Wheels can roll neither up nor down. Pegg'd like Ariel in a rifted Oak, We can only Sprawl in the Air with our Arms and leggs, like  [illegible]   Ariel, and fill the Atmosphere with our Cries and Clamours. I forgot to mention, the young Mens Land. I must have it. I always understood there were but Eleven Acres. The Price is exorbitant. But pray the Dr. to make the best bargain he can and finish the Business. I mean the Land of the young Haydens. The charming Letter from our son I return. I know very well all his Meaning. He will see Mankind in his Youth.  turn over Yours of the 18  reached me in four days. i.e. on the 22d. I know your Difficulties. I like Billings and wish him engaged. Copeland I am indifferent about. He is not a Man to my Mind. I mean to do very little at farming. I will let out On shares all I have next Year. I see no Prospect of leaving this City before the fifth or Sixth of June. Obstinacy must be resisted with rational firmness and steadiness.  "
"Philadelphia  April 26. 1796
","My Dearest Friend Our Chariot is still fixed and cannot move. Petitions and Instructions are coming in from various Quarters: But those who have heretofore pretended that Instructions were to be implicitly   obeyed, now declare that they will disregard them. It appears that Mr. Adams will not have a large Majority as Governor but whether the ardent Speech in  Boston will not excite the envious, the malignant and the vindictive to petition against the Treaty, I know not. Little Business is done.  Suffers. All Thoughts are monopolized by the Treaty. My old Friend C. J. Mc Kean has had the Weakness to be taken in with the Flattery of Dollars and Swanwick and Gallatin to sign a Petition against the Appropriations. Mr. Harper Spoke Yesterday for three hours and his Speech was very much Admired. I heard a little of it at the Close and was much pleased. He was in  of the Treaty. We are an unhappy divided People. We are making too much haste to prove that our Constitution is yet too popular. Three  Mass. Men are among the most malignant and inveterate. Two of them Lyman and Dearbourne, are loose Characters. This however must be reserved to yourself.  "
"Phil.  April 28: 1796
","My Dearest Friend Our Coach is Still . The Anarchical Warriours are beat out of all their Entrenchments by the Arguments of the Friends of Peace and order. But Party Spirit is blind and deaf, totally destitute of Candour, unfeeling to every candid sentiment. The People are alarmed and Petitions are coming from all Quarters, mostly in favour of the Treaty. The Business will not be finished, if the first Vote should be against the Treaty in the House. The Senate must then take up the Subject and send down a Bill for Appropriating Monies for the British Treaty which will occasion another Debate in the House. I have no Letter from you this Week as yet. Mr. Madison looks worried to death. Pale, withered, haggard. Livingston looks like Horror. They have brought themselves into great Embarrassment. Gallatin has been exposed and his Ignorance as well as his other Ridicules held up. It is intolerable that a , should act such a Part as he has done and yet go on.   "
"Phil.  April 30. 1796
","My Dearest Friend I am not  at your Anxiety expressed in  your Letter of the 25th.  which I received Yesterday. The Conduct of certain Mules has been so gloomy and obstinate for five Months past as to threaten the most dangerous Effects. The Proceedings of  Boston,  N. York and  Philadelphia now compared with their intemperate folly last July or August is a curious Specimen of Shyotians with foreign Courts and Nations by the People at large in Town Meetings. Those Cities have disgraced themselves and their Leaders. The House Yesterday in Committee voted to make the Appropriations. But in the House they will disagree themselves again by Party , to day and by factious Preambles or preparatory Resolutions. Our Varnum who is as cross a Goat as any from  Virginia not excepting Rutherford was out of the Way. Another Member Patten from  Delaware was absent. Both will vote to day against the Resolution: so that the Business is still in suspence: and the Anxiety and Vigilance of the People ought not to relax. Mr. Ames, the day before Yesterday in his feeble State, Scarcely able to stand upon his Legs and with much difficulty finding Breath to utter his Periods, made one of the best Speeches he ever produced to the most  Audience ever assembled. He was attended to with a silence and Interest never before known and he made an Impression that terrified the hardiest and will never be forgotten. Judge Indel and I happened to sit together. Our feelings beat in Unison. My God! How great he is says Indel? He is delightful Said I -- presently gracious God! Says Indel how great he has been""? He has been noble, said I. After some time Indel breaks out Bless my stars I never heard any thing so great since I was born! It is divine said I. And then We went on  [illegible]   with our Interjections not to say Tears till the End. Tears enough were shed -- not a dry Eye I believe in the House, except some of the  [illegible]   Jack Asses who had occasioned the Necessity of the oratory. These attempted to laugh, but their Vissages grinn'd horrible ghastly smiles. They smiled like Foulans son in Lane when they made him kiss his Fathers dead and bleeding Head. Perhaps the Speech may not read as well. The situation of the Man excited Compassion and interested all Hearts in his favour. The Ladies wished his soul had a better Body. We are told Harri Otis excelled at  Boston and displayed great Oratorical Talents. I cannot give Encouragement nor entertain any hope of getting away before the fifth of June. Unless the hard hearts should be softened. The Heart of Pharaoh was judicially hardened and so are those of ----. Mass. has 3 of the worst -- two of whom are moral Characters, of a Levity altogether inconsistent with the Principles, Practices, Habits and Wishes of their Constituents. I mean Lyman and Dearborne. Dissipation is their prevailing Virtue and all they have to boast. I wish their Constituents would institute an Inquiry into their Conduct. Varnum is an Obstinate fool. Entre nous all this.   "
"Philadelphia  May 3d. 1796
","Tuesday My Dearest Friend The Result of Saturdays Debate in the H. of R. removes all Anxiety for the Remainder of this session, and leaves me at Liberty to ask Leave to  go home. The state of my own Health which requires Relaxation and the Sickness in my Family and Neighbourhood, would have well justified me, if I had retired even before the great Question was decided. I shall ask Leave this Day, unless something unforeseen should happen to prevent me. If I should obtain Leave of Absence after Thursday next I shall be at  New York on Sunday. Whether I shall go by Water or Land from thence will depend upon Circumstances. Sometime in the Course of the Week after next I hope to see you, but there are so many Circumstances of Wind and Weather as well as other Things which may intervene, that I cannot make any Disposition by which I can calculate to a day or a Week when I shall get home. It is a Mortifying Consideration that five Months have been wasted upon a Question whether National Faith is binding on a Nation. Nothing but the Ignorance  and Inexperience of this People can excuse them. Really We have not a right sense of moral or national Obligations. We have no National Pride -- No National sense of Honour. I suppose the Decision of the H. has determined The P.'s Resignation and Retirement. And The Question who shall Succeed him may occasion as much Controversy and Animosity as The Treaty with  Great Britain, which was ultimately determined by no proper Considerations of Merit, but merely by fear of Constituents in many. If My Plan should be altered in any respects I shall write you an Account of it. I must spend a little time, with the Children At  New York. I have been five Months, without once mounting a horse and without one long Walk so that  I have walked every day more or less, I am under some fears of the Effects upon my Health of a Journey of an 100 miles a day in a stage. The  Letters please to file away carefully with the others.    "

","My Dearest Friend As I have obtained Leave of Absence After this day and shall  out on my return home tomorrow morning, You will not write me after the Receipt of this Letter. I shall get home as fast as possible, Spending a few days with The Children at  N York. Yesterday was a Day of Universal and perpetual Peace. All the Treaty Hills passed both Houses and good  seems to be returning. I wrote our sons this morning by Mr. Cooke of  Mary land bound to  Europe. I have not been on Horse or in Carriage more than once or twice since I arrived here and I dread the Journey: It will however be sweetened by delicious hopes.  "
"Lovejoys in Stratford Nov. 27. 1796
","My dearest Friend We lodged at Monroe's in  Marlborough on Wednesday night, at Hithcocks in  Brookfield Thursday night, at Lovejoys in  Stratford last night. I have been to hear sound orthodox Calvinism from Mr. Stebbins this morning. At  Hartford I Saw Mr. Adets Note in Folio to our Secretary of State, and I find it an Instrument well calculated to reconcile me to private Life. It will purify me from all Envy of  or Mr. Pinckney or Mr. Burr or Mr. Any Body who may be chosen P. or V. P. Although, however, I think the moment a dangerous one, I am not Scared. Fear takes no hold of me, and makes no Approaches to Me, that I perceive, and if my Country makes  just Claims upon me, I will be as I ever have been -- prompt to shares Fates and Fortunes with her. I dread not a War, with  France or  England, if either forces it upon Us, but will make no Aggression upon either, with my free Will, without just and necessary Cause and Provocation. In all Events of Peace or War, I think Prices must fall considerably before Spring. Lands, , Provisions and all. We have had so cold a Journey that I fear our Stone Wall Stands still. If it does however I suppose Manure, or Ploughing or cutting and carting Wood will furnish Employment enough. Nothing mortifies me more, than to think how the English will be gratified at this French Flight. John Bull will exult and  his  shoulders like a Frenchman, and I fear show Us some cunning, insidious kind of Kindness upon the Occasion. I should dread his Kindness as much as French Severity. But will be the Dupe of neither. If I have looked with any Accuracy into the Hearts of my Fellow Citizens, The French will find as the English have found, that Feelings may be Stirred which they never expected to find there, and that Perhaps the American People themselves are not Sensible or within them. I shall write You from  N York. This cold Weather makes me regret the Loss of my Bed, and Fireside, and assuredly the Companion and Delight of both.  "

At night the  and his two Brothers came home from hunting Patridges and Quails an Amusement which had engaged them two Days. Halcyon Days are over, at that house but Horses are still very plenty. Yesterday I came to Town and have been happy with My Son and Daughter here. The Baby is pretty and has the Small Pox very lightly. Miss Caledine Nabbys Baby is as fat and rosy and hearty as a Country Girl can be. Charles has a great deal of Business, and looks and dresses respectably: keeps good Company and minds his office. Mr. Jay and I met last Evening on our Anniversary 30 of  and were very happy. I go on this afternoon for  Philadelphia,  threatened with a Snow Storm. I can tell you nothing about Elections, only that the Fed's appear to be sanguine and the Antifeds too in reality or appearance. There is some Anxiety lest Pinckney should be Smuggled in, unintentionally, to the first Place. I hope he will not come in to any. I wrote you from  Stratford and shall write next from  Philadelphia. We have had a cold uncomfortable Journey. Prices risen since May both of Travelling and Subsistence, and Publicans less Attentive and obliging. The Federalists in  Pensilvania prevailed in two of their Ticket the Antis in the rest.  New York is said to be unanimous. The French Minister is fulfilling your Sons Predictions with astonishing Exactness but it is said he has disgusted and alienated Friends from  France. How this will appear in Congress Time will discover. I shall be mistaken in my Guesses, if Americans in general are very Servile. I have as yet no Letter from You and am uninformed of the History of Agriculture. But I presume That Firewood and Stock have had the chief Attention since I left you. Brisler is well.    "
"Philadelphia  December 4. 1796
","My dearest Friend After spending a Day and a Night at  East Chester with our Children there and another at  New York with our Children there I came to this City on  night after a cold ride of 80 miles from  Elizabeth Town. There are great Complaints of Want of Water for grinding, for Cattle and for Families through the whole Country. Yesterday I dined with the  in Company with John Watts the King of the Cherokees with a large Number of his Chiefs and their Wives -- among the rest the Widow and Children of Hanging Man a famous Friend of ours who was basely murdered by Some White People. The President dined four Setts of Indians on four several Days the last Week. The French  have gained the Votes of  Pensilvania and how many others is unknown. The Election will be a meagre one and I shall not envy it. I  the Letters of Mr. J. Q. A. to the President who told me that Things appeared to him exactly as they did to his Minister. To Day he has Sent me a Letter to him from Mr. T. Paine dated at  Paris 20 of September 1795 which he said was the most insulting Letter he ever received. Paine accuses the  of Connivance at his Imprisonment in  France, thinks he ought to have interposed in his behalf and reclaim'd him. ""I ought not to have Suspected you of Treachery, but I must continue to think you treacherous, till you give me cause to think otherwise. I am Sure you would have found yourself more at your Ease, if you had acted by me as you ought, for whether your Desertion of me was intended to gratify the English Government, or to let me fall into Destruction in  France, that you might exclaim the louder against the French Revolution, or whether you hoped by my Extinction to meet with less opposition in mounting up the American Government, either of these will involve you in Reproach you will not easily shake off."" These are his Words. I am told that Mr. Pride of  Virginia who had the Duel with Mr. Carpenter in  England went over to  France and has  to  America and brought Packetts and Letters for Mr. Jefferson, Mr. Madison, Mr. Giles and Mr. Bache, as well as for the Sec. of State. Mr. Paines long  Pamphlet against the President it is supposed is Arrived and Mr. Bache is to publish it in the form of a Letter to George Washington. It is even Said that a Patent is to be obtained for the exclusive Priviledge of publishing it. Whether the French Directory have only been drawn in, to  the Election of a Favourite, or whether in their Trances and Deleriums of Victory they think to terrify  America, or whether in their Sallies they may not venture on Hostilities time will discover. Americans must be coal and Steady if they can. Some of our People may be  cured or their extravagant Love, and shaken in their unlimited Confidence. The French Character whether under Monarchical or Republican Government is not the most equitable, nor the least assuring of all Nations. The Fire, Impetuosity, and Vehemence of their  Temperament is apt to be violent, immoderate and extravagant. The Passions are always outragious. A Frenchman in Love, must shoot himself or succeed. A Frenchman in Anger must shed the Blood of his Object, and so of the rest. I hope We shall make two Houses tomorrow.   "

","My Dearest Friend I have received your Letter of the cold Sunday on which I wrote You one from  Stratford. In  N. York  gave me the original Letter, the Duplicate of which you transmitted me. I communicated it to the P. with five preceeding Numbers. After reading them The P. was pleased to say that  ""Mr. Adams's Intelligence was very good, and his Penetration and foresight very great. At least Things appeared to him in  Europe exactly as they did to himself here."" He communicated to me T. Paines impudent Letter. This is the very Day the which. I laugh at myself twenty times a Day, for my feelings, and meditations and Speculations in which I find myself engaged. Vanity Suffers. Cold feelings of Unpopularity. Humble reflections. Mortifications. Humiliation. Plans of future Life. Economy. retrenching of . Farming. Return to the Bar, drawing Writs, arguing Causes, taking Clerks. Humiliations of my Country under foreign Bribes, Measures to counteract them. All this miserable Nonsense will come and go like evil into the Thoughts of Gods or Men, approved or unapproved. Cousin Smith is said to have written Phocian and Murray the Pieces from  Mary land. The Election is a  at this hour and if my Reason were to dictate I should wish to be left out. A. P. with half the Continent upon his Back besides all  France and  England old Tories and all Jacobins to carry will have a devilish Load. He will be very apt to Stagger and stumble. If the Southern states are as unanimous as the Northern are Supposed to be I shall be left out. But it is Said there will be 3 in  Virginia and one in  N. Carolina against . In  Pensilvania the Rebells in the West and the corupt Mob of  Philadelphia aided by frightened Quakers gave a Majority of from 20 to 100, against the great Agricultural Counties of  Lancaster,  York and  Cuberland. It really Seems to me as if I wished to be left out. Let me See! do I know my own heart? I am not Sure. However all that I seem to dread, is a foolish, mortifying, humiliating, uncomfortable Residence here, for two tedious months after I shall be known to be Skimmed, as my Wallmen Speak. I can pronounce  to be chosen P. of U. S. with firmness and a good grace that I dont fear. But here alone abed, by my fireside nobody to Speak to, poring upon my Disgrace and future Prospects -- this is Ugly. The 16 of Feb. will soon come and then I take my Leave, for ever. Then for Frugality and Independence. Poverty and Patriotism. Love and a Carrot bed. The Federalists are all very confident however of a small Majority. I say and believe that small Majority worse than none, and wish there could have been a large Majority any other Way. Dont show this stuff.    "

","My Dearest Friend  are some Signal Accomplishments of Prophecies. Be cool and discreet in your Communications of them. No such Person as Jasper Dwight is known to either of the Senators of  Vermont. The Signature is thought to be fictitious. I have no Letter from you later than the Sunday after my Departure. Major Butle r has indeed . They kept back Paines Letter Several Weeks, presuming no doubt that it would not promote their Election. It appeared for the first, this morning. I think, of all Paines Productions it is the weakest and at the same time the most malicious. The Man appears to me to be mad -- not drunk. He has the Vanity of the  who believed himself  [illegible]   to be Jupiter the Father of Gods and Men. There is a Dr. Edwards here -- a Relation of Mr. Burr and Pierpoint Edwards who has lately  from  Paris. Perhaps he may be the Pensilvanian of whom you read. I can Say nothing of Election. I have received  the Votes of  New Jersey but know not for whom they are, as they are under Seal. The Feelings of Friendship excite a Curiosity to know how Mc Kean will vote. By that I shall guess how Gov. Adams would have voted. But I have Seen Friendships of S. Quincy, Jona. Sewall, Daniel Leonard,  Brattle, Treasurer Grey and fifty others go away like a vapour before political Winds -- and a constant Succession of Others go the same Way from that time to this, that I cannot depend upon any Feelings of my own Judgment I can form from any Feelings of my own. No private Friendship would induce me to Spare a wrong Political Character. But Mc Kean and Adams can never believe the Lies that are told. If they could vote against me it must be because they think I should not be  Supple enough to the French. I have known the Time when both of them would have been as Stiff as myself. I feel myself in a very happy temper of Mind. Perfectly willing to be released from the Port of Danger but determined if  to it, to brave it, if its horrors were ten times thicker than they are. I have but few Years of Life left and they cannot be  [illegible]   better bestowed, than upon that Independence of my Country in Defence of which it that Life has ever been in Jeopardy.  "

","My Dearest Friend I have just received  your  of the 4th . I wrote you from  Stratford,  New York and from  Philadelphia. Adets Note has  had some Effect  Pensilvania and prov'd  [illegible]  a Terror to some Quakers and that is all the ill Effect it has had. Even the southern States appear to resent it. If  Hamiltons personal  [illegible]  Dislike of Jefferson does not obtain too much Influence with  Massachusetts Electors, neither Jefferson nor Pinckney would will be President nor Pinckney V.P. of  U.S. I am not enough of an Englishman nor little enough of a French Man for some People. These would be very willing that Pinckney should come in, Chief. But they will be disappointed. The Letter you Sent me has been read by many and is admired by all. It is impossible it should be otherwise. Hichbourn held the Same Language here. I find nobody here intimidated. Those who wish to say they are dare not. There is a grand Spirit in the Senate.  Giles Says  ""the Point is settled. The V.P. will be President. He is undoubtedly chosen. The old Man will make a good President too (theres for you). But We shall have to check him a little now and then. That will be all."" Thus Mr. Giles. I am just now come from pronouncing a most affectionate Address of the Senate to the  in Answer to his Speech. I felt so much that I was afraid I should betray a Weakness, but I did not. I thought I was very firm and cool. But the Senators Say that I pronounced it in so affecting a manner that I made them cry. The Tears did certainly trickle. The President himself was affected more tenderly than ever I saw him in my Life in pronouncing his Reply. The Southern Gentlemen with whom I have conversed, expressed more Affection for me than they ever did before since 1774. They certainly wish Adams elected rather than Pinckney. Perhaps it is because Hamilton and Jay are said to be for Pinckney. I had rather hazard  my little Venture in the ship to the Pilotage of Jefferson, than that of Pinckney, or Burr. My old Friend McKean, had so often expressed his Friendship and Confidence in me, that his Conduct is much censured and ridiculed. Nothing affects me so much as to see McKean, Whitehill, Osgood and even Sam Adams and such Men  up in opposition to me. It gives Such a Specimen of Party Spirit as is very disgusting, very shocking. Mrs A I remember the time, however, when the Friendship of Sam. Quincy, Jona. Sewall, Daniel Leonard,  Brattle and Treasurer Gray and twenty others went away from me in Consequence of political systems and Party Spirit. I remember too an hundred other Instances during the Revolution and Since of declared Friendships giving Way before Jealousy, Envy and Competition or Rather Rivalry that these Things do not shock me as they would have done when I had less Experience. The Inveteracy of Party Spirit is however indeed  at present. There have been  and Combinations in this Election that would Surprize you. I may one day or other develope them to you. There is an active Spirit, in the Union, who will fill it with his  wherever he is. He must be attended to and not Suffered to do too much.  "

","My Dearest Friend The Accounts We have of Fires in  Georgia and  New york are not much more distressing than those We hear of the Miseries brought upon Numbers by Speculation. Mr. Morris,  Mr. Greenleaf,  Mr. Wilson,   Mr. Nicholson and  Mr. Barclay are the common Topicks of Conversation. How many worthy Families must Suffer with these Sufferers? And where the Conflagration will Stop, I know not and no body pretends to predict. The  which Seiz'd Some People in  Philadelphia, at the Sudden Appearance of Mr. Adets Note, lasted not long. There are who wish'd it to be more general and durable but they have been disappointed. I have been told by a Gentleman from  Massachusetts that Mr. James Winthrop of  Cambridge is one of the principal Writers in the Chronicle. I should be Sorry to believe, without Evidence a report So injurious to his Reputation. I wish to know the Truth however. His Father would be grieved if he lived and knew it. His Father,  a Friend of Liberty and lover of his Country was a wise Man. We wait for News from  Virginia and  Mass. to determine the Question of the Election.  "
"Philadelphia  Decr. 16. 1796
","My Dearest Friend I received this morning  your kind Letter of the 7th.  and wonder you had not received a Letter. I wrote from  Stratford and  New York and twice a Week since I have been here. Your Anxiety for your Country  is amiable and becomes your Character. Elevated Expectations of Grandeur and Glory as well as Prosperity have accompanied me through Life and been a great source of my Enjoyment. They are not diminished by the present Prospect. It seems to be now certain, that Unless  has Votes in  N. Hampshire,  Vermont or  Rhode Island he can not be President. But it is not improbable that Mr. Pinckney may be, unless  N. C. should be of Opinion with  Virginia that J.A. had better be P. than Pinckney. The Northern Members have kept their Promise better than the Southern. They have got a great Number for Pinckney but the Southern have got none for  The English Party have outgeneraled the French and American both. That is the Construction I put upon it though others would make me believe if they could that it is an insidious  of Hamiltons individual ambition.  I care not whose Maneuvre it is; nor who is the Dupe nor whether it is foreign Influence or private Ambition: so long as I am not guilty of any sin of Omission or Commission in the Business. The whole system is utterly repugnant to my Judgment and Wishes. I wish Patrick Henry had 138 Votes and would Accept them. Pinckney has no Pretensions to any of them more than Dr. Jarvis. If Chance and Trick are to decide, it had better be decided by french Influence for aught I know or even by English, for either Jefferson or Hamilton had better Pretensions and would have made better Presidents than Pinckney. I shall not suffer so much in retiring as the  whose tender feelings are excited both by Kindness and Unkindness. I shall retire without much of either to harrow up my soul. It is rather a dull Prospect to see nothing but ones Plougshare between one and the Grave but I am confident I can bear it as well as the P. My Misery will all be over by the Ninth of Feb. if I am released. But that is too long.   "

","My dearest Friend I went Yesterday at 12 0 Clock to the  Presbyterian Meeting House in  Market Street to hear Dr. Rush pronounce an elegant and patriotic  on Mr. Rittenhouse the late President of the Philosophical Society. He made him out to be a good Man and a great Astronomer and Philosopher. This I agree and if he had not betrayed Jacobinical Weaknesses I should have liked him very well. Dr.   Euwing is Sick and melancholly, has lost his Wifes fortune by trusting Speculators and has had recourse to imprudent means to raise his Spirits as they Say. He has done preaching for the present at least. It is now Said, but I have not made the Calculations, to be made certain that neither Mr. Pinckney nor Mr. Jefferson can be President: consequently my Troubles are not far off. Strong in the Confidence of my own Honesty, and  by the Appearance of tolerable health and the feeling of Some Strength,  I perceive no Consternation at the Prospect. There have not been wanting Insinuations to make me believe that Hamilton and Jay have insidiously intrigued to give Pinckney a Sly shade over my head, and the southern Men Swear, if they had suspected this I should have had all their Votes. I do believe that both of them had rather Pinckney should come in P. than  be either P. or V. P. One of them might believe he should have more Influence with Pinckney than with me. Both of them might think, that if I was out of the Way, one or other of them might have a better Chance to come in at next Election into one or the other office. Both of them may have designs or desires of closest Connections with  England than I should approve. But whatever cause for these Surmises may exist, they shall make no Impression on my Friendship for those Characters. I believe their Motives were what they received for publick Good. Jay at least had probably no active share in the Business. H. certainly had. But I think it is now evident that the Southern States have had all these Contingencies in Contemplation and that they preferred me, in  either office to Pinkney or Burr, and I am more indebted to the southern states for this Election than to  Massachusetts, thirteen of whose Votes were determined I presume by Hamiltons Letters to Higginson, if not to Cabot, and who certainly were willing to sacrifice me, rather than that Jefferson should come in V.P. The common Saying here is that it is an Interposition of Providence that has saved me, defeated Pinckney, and disappointed the English Party as well as the French. The French however are deceived. I am more their Friend than they are aware of. I am much mistaken if I do not remove many Prejudices  at home and abroad before the fourth of March. There are manly Ways of correcting Errors, that all Men dont perceive. These are confidential Communications from    "
"Philadelphia  Decr. 19. 1796. Monday
","My dearest Friend I have this morning  yours of the 9th . Am glad you have mine from  Stratford: you will receive others in Succession. I am not much chagrined at the disappointment of ploughing the Hill. The Spring will do. The more Seaweed is procured the better. I need not exort you to get Wood. I am Glad Mr. Bass is provided for. I wish you to expend as little as possible in  except for Seaweed and Sledding Stones across the Mill Pond if there should be opportunity, and for a fence against Jona. Bass. The general Delusion of Speculation has involved the great Chiefs. McClenichan is in Trouble. His son Stewart left nothing. Mr. Morris, Mr. Nichols, Mr. Wilson, Mr. Greenleaf, Mr. Barclay and many others are talked of as in Such distress as to Spread a general Consternation among the Merchants. I can never enough deplore the  of plunging into Schemes of Such vast magnitude and complication, living in Such Pomp and Such Expence upon Property of others, giving Charities, making feasts, Signing Subscriptions, blaring away with Furniture, Equipage &c. and then discovering that all this is Credit, and that Multitudes of honest People must be involved in distress in Consequence of it. I Saw enough at  East Chester. But I had long expected it. Where is the moral Principle? where is the Honesty? of rolling in Luxury upon the Property of others? I fear that Dishonesty will appear as well as Distress. That large Sums in Trust, will be found misapplied. Trusts violated and prostituted. Give me Poverty, give me Death rather than the Sting of remorse for violated Confidence. The Writers in the Chronicle, take great Pains to impute this Stagnation to the Government. But with great Injustice. I fear it has arisen from a Defect of the Constitution, in not giving to Congress the exclusive Power of creating and regulating Banks and limiting even their Power to a moderate Sum: But I am cautious and fearful of explaining myself on this Subject. The Bank of  Pensilvania has Spread an Alarm. I hope that all others will take Warning. I see that Hamilton is the Object of Chronicle wrath. But Hamilton did not establish the state Banks, and they have had their ful share in the Imprudence and the Mischief. Mr. Bloodworth of  N. Carolina Said to me this morning he could now congratulate me on the Certainty of my Election as President: But I make no Calculations, As far as I see it is still possible that Pinckney may be P.  I think cannot. The  Vermont votes are Safe enough. They are not liable to the Objective apprehended. The Alarm which was Spread in  Philadelphia and  Pensilvania by Adets Note has Subsided. You will see that Congress is not intimidated. Though a Party in the H. is still too Strong. It is cruel that  Mass. shd. increase this Party. Bill Lyman went all Lengths.  Dearbourne and Coll. Varnum Stop'd Short. Mr. A's Letters are in high Reputation. I heard one of the Cabinet Say that Mr. A's Correspondence was the most Satisfactory of any of the foreign Ministers abroad. Many have read them and all admire them. But the  which appears to have been played at the House and in the Suite of a foreign Minister at  Paris is a Serious Thing. If our Ambassadors are to harbour the Destroyers of Religion and Government, where are We? If our Ambassadors abroad will not frown on Abuses of their Employers who will. Examples must and will be made.   "
"Philadelphia  December 20. 1796
","My dearest Friend I Yesterday dined at Mr. Binghams and Sitting next to Madam at Table, had Something like a political Conversation with her. She has more ideas of the Subject than I Suspected: and a corrector Judgment. She gave me the Characters of Several of the notable Foreigners, and I find has the Same Jealousies of them, which I have entertained. Talleyrand, Liancourt, Volney, Caznove &c. Noailles is the only one, that She thinks has much Friendship for  America. She Says that Noailles declares to them all that he has renounced  France forever, that he never will return, in any change of affairs, unless as a Traveller or Visitor and that if  France Should make War on  America he would take Arms in her . Talley rand since his return to  France has been very bitter against Us, she says. Liancourt has become very violent and is negotiating   his return. Volney she Says professes Friendship and a good opinion, but is so proud a Man and has such Principles that she can have no confidence. Caznove from a high Government Man has become an inveterate Democrat. She considers them all as Spies upon Us, and wishes them all away. This is confidential, and I would not be the occasion of any Misunderstanding between her and these Gentlemen but I was highly pleased with her Attachment to her Country, The  is cruelly treated, and I really entertain Serious Apprehensions for his Health. He must plunge into Agriculture and ride away his Reflections or he will see a Spectre, like Gill Blass's Count Olivarez. I saw him and his Lady to Day and they both enquired after You. The Pensilvanian you  after is probably a certain Dr. Edwards a Relation and Intimate of Mr. Burr, who has been probably Speculating in  France in Connection with him. Mr. Hitchbourne held the same Language here as We expected. I am told that Blair, McClenican, and Mr. Barclay as well as Mc Kean were very busy against me. The two first are now in a Predicament that would more than revenge me if I was Vindictive, which I never was and will not now begin to be. The opposers of Government are rotten in heart and hollow in show of Property. Greenleaf I fear will loose Character, Fortune, Wife and all together. I wish I may be mistaken. The Curses against Blair and Barclay are very loud and bitter. All Confidence between Man and Man is suspended for a Time. There is a devilish Spirit of Corruption and Wickedness in this City that exceeds all the Capitals in the Union. It is supposed to be certain that  cannot be P. and a narrow Squeak it is as the Boys say, whether he or P. shall be Daddy Vice: a Character that I shall soon relinquish whether I am or not the Person whom they now toast under the Title of ""The President elect. I have been Dady Vice long enough.   "

","My Dearest Friend Out of the  Note, you will please to take up the my Note to our Friend for 300 Dollars. The Remaining three hundred you will Use as frugally as possible. Please to acknowledge the Rect. as soon as may be. There is still reason to entertain some Doubt whether Mr. Pinckney will not be P. If  Georgia,  Tennessee and  Kentucky should give him a few Votes, which I think is far from improbable he will have more than . As it is at present I believe there is a Tye between him and Mr. Jefferson. The South Carolinians have disappointed all sides as much as  Pensilvania did. The Vengeance of the Rutledge Family appears to have done it.   "

","My Dearest Friend The  extract of a Letter which I have Seen, from a Gentleman who dined with you last Summer is so unexpected to me, that I Send it as a curiosity. ""All Men have Confidence in  Abilities and Integrity. For my own Part, I thank God that We are at length to be governed by Talent and Science, and no longer by the blind Adoration and mysterious influence of a name."" The Sting at the retiring Hero, hurts me. Science, in Some of its Branches, may not have been possessed in any eminent Degrees: but Talents of a very  kind are his. I wish I had as good, and Science of himself and others, beyond almost any Man he has shewn all his Life. I never shall attain so much of that most necessary and Useful Science. The Compliment upon me is as flattering as it was unexpected: and gives me some hopes that I may be so fortunate as to be Supported in some degree by the Author of it. But the Support of Such Speculators is not long to be depended on. They involve  in Such Difficulties that they cannot in the End Support themselves. Dined Yesterday with  Pickering. He has no Letters from  the Hague so late as 30 of September the Date of Thomas's to Dr. Welsh. Mr. Dallas has cleared up his Character entirely by Authentic Certificates from the Bank: but the People Say here that while he exculpates himself he inculpates his Patron, who has been more grossly charged and is not exonerated. There is a Dissolution of Principle, Conduct and Decorum, of a very portentous aspect, Worse in this City than in any other Part of the Union.   "

According to present Appearances,  will be  [illegible]   Daddy Vice, and between you and me I expect you will soon see a more ample Provision made for him, that he may live in Style and not be obliged to live lodge at Taverns and ride in Stage Coaches. I See plainly enough that when your Washingtons and Adams's are stowed away our dear Country will have a gay Government. I cannot help these injudicious Extreams into which People will run, nor these invidious Partialities. The  of Peculation and Want of Probity as well as want of Fidelity to Trust are allarming and afflicting. My Old Friends Mifflin, McKean, Ewing, exhibit despicable and detestible Phenomena for Governors, Judges and Heads of Colledges, as their Conduct is represented daily in public Comparisons. I know nothing more. McKean indeed is only charged with a little too weak Madeira and Infidelity to Friendship and political Principle. Whatever the French may Say without stammering  or with Swaggering, the American People will not be frightened by them. Swan came to visit me, as well as Tenche Coxe. What a Puppy this last? He left his Card. I was at home when the other came and had a Conversation with him civilly enough. The Prospect before me, opens many Questions and Inquiries concerning House, Furniture, Equipage, Servants and many other Things which will give me trouble and occupation enough and the more because you will not be here. Luckily for you. I should tremble for your health if you had all the Visits and Ceremonies to go through and all the Preparations to make. 71 is the Ne plus ultra. It is now certain that no Man can have more and but one so many. If no irregularity appears to set aside Votes 71 will carry Point. I know of no irregularity. The suggested one of  Vermont appears without foundation.    "
"Philadelphia  Decr. 30 1796
","My dearest Friend The Prospect that opens upon me presents Troubles enough of every kind. I have made Some Inquiry concerning Horses and Carriages, and find that a common Chariot of the plainest Sort cannot be had under Twelve hundred Dollars, and if you go to a little more ornament and Elegance you must give fifteen hundred. The  has a Pair of Horses to sell, one or the other 10 Years old for which he asks a thousand Dollars, and there is no Probability of procuring a decent Span for less than Six hundred dollars. House Rent, another indispensable Article will be extravagantly high. The Plenty of Paper, has un Settled every Thing. Nothing has a Price. Every one asks and every one cheats as much as he can, I think. I wish I knew what would be asked for a Chariot in  Boston. The  says he must sell Something to enable him to clear out. When a Man is about retiring from Public Life and sees nothing but a Ploughshare between him and the Grave, he naturally thinks most upon that. When Charles the fifth resigned his Empire and crown, he went to building his Coffin. When I contemplated a Retirement I meditated the Purchase of Mrs. Veseys Farm and thought of building a Tomb on my own Ground adjoining to the burying Yard. The  is now engaged in his Speculations upon a Vault which he intends to build for himself, not to Sleep but to lie down in. So you See, my little head is made like two great heads and I have ambitiously placed myself between them. Mrs. Blodget, who I dare say is more desirous that you should be Presidante than that I should be Presidant, Says She is afraid  will not live long.  I should be afraid too, if I had not confidence in his Farm and his House. He must be a fool, I think, who dies of Chagrin, when he has a fine farm and a Narragansett Mare that Paces, trots and canters, but I dont know but all Men are such fools. I think a Man had better wear than rust. The Boyish Language of the Emissaries from Monroes Academy is not confined to  Boston Market.  Barney is holding the Same Cant.  must be an intrepid to encounter the open Assaults of  France and the Secret Plotts of  England, in concert with all his treacherous Friends and open Enemies in his own Country. Yet I assure you he never felt more Serene in his Life.   "

","My Dearest Friend I wish the new Year may be the happiest of your Life. Last Night I had a Visit from Dr. Rush, whose Tongue ran for an hour. So many Compliments, so many old Anecdotes. To be Sure, My Election he said, he had vast pleasure in assuring me since it had been made certain had given vast Satisfaction in this City and State. Even those who had voted for another had a great affection for me. Mr. Smilie himself had told him this very day that he had an affection for me. He met Mr. Madison in the Street and  him if he thought Mr. Jefferson would accept the Vice Presidency. Mr. Madison answered there was no doubt of that. Dr. Rush replied that he had heard Some of his Friends doubt it. Mr. Madison took from his Pocket a Letter from Mr. Jefferson himself and gave it to the Dr. to read. In it he tells Mr. Madison that he had been told there was a Possibility of a Tye between Mr. Adams and himself. If this should happen says he, I beg of you, to Use all your Influence to procure for me the Second Place, for Mr. Adams's Services have been longer, more constant and more important than mine, and Something more in the complimentary strain about qualifications &c. The Dr. then ran on with his Compliments to me and Sarcasms upon  This Country would rise in the Estimation of the World and of all  Europe, from the 4th. day of March next &. &c. &c.   It hurt me to hear this. But his old Griefs and Prejudices Still hang about him. He got disappointed to Washington during the War. He has conversed with Dr. Edwards and Edwards has told him that  Character is wholly prostrate in  France -- that Mr. Munroe has been very active and industrious in behalf of his Country, that when his Letters come to be published, they will do him great honour &c. I heard all this with perfect Composure. I only asked if Dr. Edwards had not been Speculating in french revolutionary funds? Oh no was his answer -- he believed not. He confessed he had never read the Treaty with  England nor one thing in favour of it or against it. He knew not whether it was a good or a bad one. He only disliked the Secrecy with which it was formed, negotiated, and ratified. All this Chaos, I heard in Silence, lamenting to see that the Southern Politicians had got so fast hold of him, he knew not why. With regard to my Election he had taken no Part. He had been neutral. But he had made it a Rule, whenever either  or myself had been traduced in his Company to vindicate Us both.  and I should go on affectionately together and all would be well. I should Settle all disputes with them the French well enough. These are confidential Communications. I have received no Letter from you the Week past. What Say you to coming along to  Eastchester in February and joining me in March? I cant live without you very well till next July.  "

","My Dearest Friend I received Yesterday   from  Boston. The old Patriook has got a Name of Old Scrathum, or old Scratch or Some Such Oddity that will amuse the Blackguards for a time. Mrs. Storers Verses are very shrewd. The Story of my Muleness, or Incapacity to talk, I almost wish were true -- on Some Occasions. Dr. Walters Politeness to be sure is conspicuous. It is enough at preset to think about Thorns under the Pillar of P. of  U.S. at  Philadelphia. I wish you would find out whether Gardner did write Aurelius or not -- and if not who did. Those Reports which were so full of harm, which you Suppose came to my Ears, I know not. I have never been able to get Sight of one of the hand Bills which were distributed in this City and state in such Numbers and at such an . They carefully conceal them from me. All I have heard of, is one -- which announced that if Jefferson was chosen  he would keep open House and Table for all jolly Irish Hearts: whereas if Adams should be chosen he would live as close as  Washington. These continual Successions of Elections of P., Governors, Senators, Representatives and every thing will get the whole People into an habit of Lying and fear.  Letter to Mr. Madison was Yesterday in the mouth of every one. It is considered as Evidence of his Determination to accept -- of his Friendship for me -- And of his Modesty and Moderation. I had a Visit Yesterday from Mr. De L'Etombe which I consider as an intended beginning of Intercourse. He disclaimed all authority. It was a Visit of a Man, a Philosopher and an Acquaintance of Eighteen Years. It was to assure and convince me that the Directory never had a thought of interfering in our Election, not a Wish to oppose me or impose any other &c. A long Conversation ensued too long to state now at length. I told him in Brief that I must Support the Courts taken of the  United States, and the system of impartial Neutrality but, if belligerent Powers,  it should be other wise ordained by Congress -- consistent with that Duties I should be allways friendly to the French. He went away professing to be well satisfied.  Perhaps more of this may turn up. I may give you a more particular detail of this Interview. Whether he was sent by others I know not.  "

We have been destroying all Terror of Crimes and are becoming the Victims of them. We have been destroying all Attachment and Obligation to Country and are Sold in Consequence by Traitors. We have been opening our Arms wide to all Foreigners and placing them on a footing with Natives: and Now foreigners are dictating to Us if not betraying Us.

As great an Hypocrite as any in the U.S. His Intrigues in the Election I despise. That he has Talents I admit but I dread none of them. I shall take no notice of his Puppy head but retain the same Opinion of him I always had and maintain the same Conduct towards him I always did, that is keep him at a distance. The Constancy and Fidelity of Mr. Gerry contrasted with the Weathercockison of McKean and the Rutledges and the Hypocricy of others touches the inmost feelings of my Heart.

Dined Yesterday with Major Jackson in Company with General Lincoln who lodges there. Married to Miss Willing who is an  Woman and comfortably provided for by an Office, he lives  [illegible]   in a neat and elegant Taste: but I believe prudently. Mr. Ames and a few more, made a very Social set and We enjoyed Ourselves without Alloy. The most unpleasant Part of the Prospect before me, is that of remaining here till June or July. I cant see my grass and Barley grow nor my Wall rise. I have however almost forgotten my Farm. It appears very differently to me. It seems as if I ought not to think about it. The River is frozen so that nothing can get out. Besides flour is dearer here than at  Boston by one third. It has rained to day like a flood. But the Weather must be very warm and continue so many days before the River can open. There is no probability of it, for some time. If it opens in Season I shall Send Some grass Seeds. I will not Suffer the Bushes I have cut down to grow again: but I shall not attend much to my Farm. My whole Time and Thoughts must be devoted to the Public. As long as Trask lives I shall have enough for him to do perhaps. I hope Billings will come to himself and get your Wood. I think of you and dream of you and long to be with you. But I Suppose this must not be yet.  "

","My Dearest Friend Mr. Beale called upon me, a few Days ago and left  your Letter of  23d  . Last Evening I presented him to the P. and Mrs. W. together with Mr. Howard, a son of Dr. Howard of  Boston. You Say Mr. H. is very full of his Praises of Mr. Monroe. So is Dr. Edwards. He Says Mr. Monroes Correspondence will do him infinite  when it comes to be published -- and all that. Monroes House has been a School for Scandal against his Country, its Government and Governors. Mr. Jay and his Treaty &c. Edwards Says, as Dr. Rush told me that  Character was in total Contempt in  France. This I shall not believe till I have better Evidence than that of any or all these great Personages. Nay, than all the Directory Ancients and five hundred. Mr. Madison is to retire. It Seems, the Mode of becoming great is to retire. Madison I Suppose after a Retirement of a few Years is to be President or V. P. Mr. Cabot I suppose, after  his Character in the shade, a few Years is to be some great Thing too -- and Mr. Ames -- &c. &c. &c. It is  how political Plants grow in the shade. Continual Day light and sun shine, Show our Faults and record them. Our Persons, Voices, Cloaths, Gate, Air, Sentiments, &c. all become familiar to every Eye and Ear and Understanding and they diminish in Proportion, upon the same Principle that no Man is an Hero to his Wife or Valet de Chamber. These Gentlemen are certainly in the right to run away and hide. Tell Mr. Cabot so, if you see him. His Countrymen will soon believe him to be a Giant in a Cave and will go in a Body and dig him out. I wish but dont tell Cabot so, that they would dig up Gerry. I have bespoke a Chariot and am treating for Horses. We read of a  from  Rotterdam arrived at  Salem or its Neighbourhood, by which I hope there may be Letters from our Young friends, as late as the middle of Novr. My Anxiety for Letters from them increases every day. They have more accurate Views and Intelligence, than any others. And what is of more importance Still, more Application and Industry. The Weather has moderated a little. I am, with anxious desires to see you, which I fear cannot be gratified before July,  Yours forever,  "

","My Dearest Friend I went Yesterday to hear Dr. Priestley, in the Philosophical Hall of the University and there I met unexpectedly with Dr. Euwing and Dr. Andross or Andrews. Euwing Seems paralytic and falling very fast. The Drift of the Discourse was to  the Superiour moral Tendency of the Jewish and Christian Religions, to that of all the Pagan Rituals ancient and modern. The Weather is moderated. I hope to find a Letter from you this Morning when I go to the Senate.  is a List of the best natured Toasts I ever read. They were Sent me in a  Baltimore Paper. They are peculiarly indulgent to me, as they allow me, Salmon and Lobster in Addition to Hay, Homminy, Mush, Milk and Cider. There is no Malice in any of them. An Old Fielder is a tough, hardy, laborious little Horse, that works very hard and lives upon very little, very Useful to his Master at Small Expence. Priestly has written something in answer to Volneys Ruin of Empires, which has been more universally read in  England than any of his Writings. I begin to long for Letters from  the Hague. Our next must be important. It is not probable, that Dr. Wests Year 1796 has wholly Stripped the Pope of his Temporalities. The French People in this Country, Seem to be disappointed and a little confounded, at the Strong Ground which has been taken by the People of this Country in Consequence of Mr. Adets Note. There have been no Signs of dismay, except among the Quakers and a few weak merchants in  Philadelphia, at the time of the Election.   I am affectionately and perpetually your faithful  "

","My Dearest Friend I have cut out two or three Slips from Browns Paper of this Evening for your Amusement. One is a conciliatory Paragraph from what hand I know not. I received this morning  yours of the 7 .  poor Billings! However Vesey I suppose with Such help as you can procure can get your Wood and feed the Cattle. Billings too may get his affair Settled and return to Business. The Million Stories that come to my Ears about the late Election are enough to keep ones visible Muscles in perpetual Exertion.  Wadsworth of  Hartford has been here this Evening and told me a Score of Anecdotes, of Intrigues and Manoeuvres. He represents the French, who are Refugees from  France and  St. Domingo &c. as all unfriendly to  America and believes that a Majority of the French Nation are so too.  He represents the People very generally highly affronted by  Adets Note. He says tho the french have plundered and wronged Us twice as much as the English, yet all the Depredations of English and French together never excited so much Indignation as Adets Note. He says Trumbull is about publishing a new Edition of McFingal and other Things. He thinks he might still be brought out and made a useful Man.  "

","My Dearest Friend I received Yesterday by the Post, the  Letter, which excites a hope of more by the Same Ship. There is a curious Mass of matter in fermentation at this Time. The French and Spaniards are as injurious as ever the English have been.  retires and his Sucessor will have but a majority of three votes at most, and as if, it were to irritate every feeling nerve a Land Tax must be discussed, at this moment and the Debtor States must be called on for their ballances. The People of  America must awake out of their golden dreams, consider where they are, and what they are about. The foolish Idolatry of  France and Paine which Russells Paper has encouraged as much as any other, has brought Us into Snares and dangers which We might have avoided. We must assume more Decorum than to run after foreign Ministers as if We were their Slaves or Subjects. The Ignorance in which our People will keep themselves of the true Character of the french Nation in general  and of their present Government as well as all their former Governments Since the Revolution, is astonishing. I must wade through all these Difficulties or be overpowered by them. And if the Case should happen that I should get Safely or even  through, it will be forgotten in one month that I had any hand in it -- judging of the future by the past. Oh no! it will not be forgotten. My Friends will remember it. Ay and my  too. They remember too well for their comfort,tho they deny. Mr. Jay, if I mistake not, will be a glorious Being in this Country before very long. Mr. Volney talks a bolder and freer Language about French affairs than I Should expect. He Says the Directory will be changed for one Director and be chosen for ten Years, which he considers, as for perpetuity. He Says all the Members of the  Assembly in 1789 will be elected into the Legislature at the next Election, &c. &c. What would I give to Spend the Evening at your fireside.   "

","My Dearest Friend With a kind Letter from Mr. Dalton I received  the inclosed from Mrs. Dalton to you. I received also a Letter from  Griffin, in which he asserts  ""that from every Information that can be collected, it was the general Wish of most of the good People of  Virginia, who are attached to order and good Government, that this happy and fortunate Event (my Election) should take Place, and that notwithstanding the Newspaper Calumny, you will in the Course of your Administration, experience as full and ample Support from this as from any other State in the Union"" and recommends Mr. John Griffin, a son of Judge Griffin, 25 years of Age, of fair Character, liberal Education, Spent two years in  England as many in  France, to live in my Family as a private Secretary."" Thus much for  Virginia. We have this day a Message from the  upon Adets Note and french Affairs, with a Letter from Mr. Pickering to Mr. Pinckney and a load of Documents, which will make Conversation enough for the People, for some time. The Consequences of this Transaction will come up after the 4 of March, and stare at me. I have had a good Education to Patience in public Affairs, and can look at a Storm with some Composure. The approaching one looks black and thick enough: but I have Confidence in the Sense, Spirit and Resources of this Country, which few other Men in the world know so well, have so long tried and found Solid. Confusions, Inconveniences and Distresses enough may await Us. This People want something to awaken them from their golden Dreams.  I am affectionately   "

I agree with the Dr. that the old Wheelbarrow must never be hung again. I feel the same Anxiety for your health that you do. But I shall write more when things are more Settled.

","Dearest Friend I have only time to  you something. Dr. Priestley breakfasted with me. I asked him whether it was his Opinion that the French would ultimately establish a Republican Government. He said it was; and his opinion was founded wholly upon the Prophecy.  France appeared to him to be one of the Horns that were to fall off. He acknowledged however the Uncertainty and related a Paragraph from a French Writer who travelled in  England immediately before the Restoration of C. 2. -- that the People were much engaged in disputing about a form of Government: But that all agreed there would never be any Kings in  England again. When Statesmen found their Judgments on Prophecies, I can never confide in their Opinions. "

","My Dearest Friend It is now determined what the  has to depend on after the 4th. March. The Committee determined against raising the Salary of P. or V. P. The House which the P. had for 500 cannot again be had under 1000. Horses are from 3 times to five times as high as they were Seven Years ago, Carriages three times as high, Provisions &c. In Short all Levees and Drawing Rooms and Dinners must be laid aside and I am glad of it. I will entertain my friends, and Such as I please and no more. The Foreign Ministers must be Seen sometimes. It will never do for you to come here before next October. The Ladies, some of them think so. The Heats are , and the Yellow Fever not improbable. The  bought the furniture of the drawing Room of Count de Moutier -- that is his, and he carries it to  Mount Vernon. The Lustre, the Glasses, the Plateau &c. are his.

"Philadelphia  January 31. 1797
","My Dearest Friend I have received  yours of January 22d . I know not the reason you had not received Letters for a Week. There has not been a Week Since I arrived in  Philadelphia that I have not written you twice or thrice. I agree with you that Something must be done for  to make her Condition comfortable and respectable. A Horse and Chaise must be at her Command and I like your other Plan very well if she approves it. But I believe She will never think of leaving my Brothers Family. If she should prefer Staying with him I will be at the Expence of the Wages and Board of a Maid or Woman to live in the House and be wholly under her Direction. If Mears will take our House, or if he does not, if Mrs. Mears will take the Care of her and she is willing to go to Mrs. Mears's, I shall be willing. But I think she will prefer scarce Provision for her at my Brothers. I shall leave it to you and her to digest and determine the Plan and any Expence for her Comfort and respectability I will chearfully defray. There are no public Letters from our sons later than the latter part of September. An Embargo, which you say the Merchants talk of petitioning for, would not perhaps answer the End. It would give a shock to Us which our People would impatiently bear and hurt the English so much more than the French, that perhaps they would persevere in their system as a Measure of Hostility against their Enemy. If you come to me at all, the earlier in the spring the better: for We must go to  Quincy for the hot Months. The Plague has got into this Country and I will not remain here, nor shall you during the Season of it. But my Dearest Friend We must consult  in every Thing. The Prices of Things are so extravagantly high that We shall be driven to Extremities to live in any decent style. I must hire and maintain secretaries as well as servants and the purchase of Horses, Carriage, Furniture and the Rent of a House 2666 Dollars & 2/3 a year will Streighten Us and put Us to all manner of shifts. I have a great Mind to dismiss all Levees, Drawing Rooms and Dinners at once. Dinners upon Washingtons Scale I will dismiss and only entertain a few select Friends. They shall have a Republican President in earnest. A Committee of Senate have reported in  of an Augmentation of salaries but  I dont expect it will pass the House if it does the Senate, and if it should what are 5000 Dollars. An Addition of Fifty thousand Dollars would not much more than restore the salary to its original Value, as Prices are tribled in most articles and doubled in all. In another Week or so The Point will be legally settled. I fear you will not persuade Mears to take our House and I know not who else to think of.  my Poor Country! Divided in herself, insulted by  France, and very frequently by Englishmen even since the Govt. have assured an Appearance of Moderation. Witness the cruel tyrannical Treatment of Capt. Diamond at  St. Eustatia. The  themselves are divided and crumbling to Pieces.Allmost all the ablest and best Men are discouraged and many of them retiring. And this has been brought about by Tom Paine and prophesying Clergymen and French Finesse and Intrigue.  But I must stop to assure You of my tenderest & and never failing Affection.  "

I hope as soon as the Point is legally settled you will have your Coach new Painted and all the Arms totally obliterated. It would be a folly to excite popular feelings and vulgar Insolence for nothing. Mrs. Washington, Mrs. Powell &c. send   their regards &c.

","My Dearest Friend I have no Letter this Week and begin to fear that your Respect to  has laid a foundation for a Sick Spring and Summer. Sometimes too I am jealous of unfair Play in the Post office to prevent me from hearing from you at the most critical Period of my Life. The public Papers must give you an Account of Proceedings, which I am wholly unable to describe. What Judgment is  of my Part in the late Transactions, by my Friends or my Ennemies, I know not. There is a Reserve in both, beyond my comprehension. The P. and Mrs. W. go off this morning for  M. Vernon. Yesterday afternoon he came to make me his farewell Visit and requested me in his own Name and Mrs. Ws. to present ""their Respects"" to . I believe that I envyed him more than he did me: and with more Reason. The House is to be cleared and cleaned, and I am to go into it on Monday next, if possible. I shall make a Small Establishment for myself for the present and wait your Advice for Ulteriour Arrangements. It is now generally understood that I am to go home before Mid summer and bring my Family in October. The Business of all kinds and Writing particularly out of the habit of which I have been so long, presses upon me very severely and would endanger my health if I did not make Conscience of riding every day. Mrs. Cushing will call upon you and give you an account of what they call The Inauguration. It is the general Report that there was more Weeping than there has ever been at the Representation of any Tragedy. But whether it was from Grief or Joy, whether from the Loss of their beloved , or from the Accession of an unbeloved one, or from the Pleasure of exchanging Presidents without Tumult or from the Novelty of the Thing, or from the sublimity of it, arising from the Multitude present, or whatever other cause I know not. One Thing I know I am a Being of too much Sensibility to Act any Part well in such an Exhibition. Perhaps there is little danger of my having Such another Scene to feel or behold. The  and Silence astonishes me. Every body talks of the Tears, the full Eyes, the streaming Eyes, the trickling Eyes &c. but all is Enigma beyond. No one descends to particulars to say Why or wherefore. I am therefore left to Suppose that it is all Grief for the Loss of their beloved.  Two or three Persons have ventured to whisper in my Ear that my Speech made an agreable Impression. I have ventured to Say Things both in that Speech and in my farewell address to the Senate, So open to Scoffs and Sarcasms that I expected them in Abundance. I have not yet Seen any.  more may come. I have been So Strangely Used in this Country, so belied and so undefended that I was determined to say some Things, as an Appeal to Posterity. Foreign nations and future times will understand them better than my Ennemies or friends will own they do. The Vanity and Egotism, which is so apparent or at least to seeming may be pardoned for what I know lest Satirical Reflections on it should provoke Some one to produce Proofs that if it is Egotism it is no Vanity. My dear Wife your Society is invaluable to me and yet I cannot enjoy it, before July I fear. All will depend upon public Events.

I fear I must send him home to fetch her, and what I shall do without him is a difficult Question. Mr. Maund writes me that he has sent a  of seed Oats to  Boston. I am sorry for it.

I have proposed to Brisler to give him 300 dollars and pay the  of his Wife and Children to this Place and back again to  Quincy, when they return. And He and his Wife and Children are to live in the Family. This is pretty well. I must and will have him. I am peremptorily for excluding all blacks and Molattoes. I hope to get into the House on Monday next. But shall purchase no nice furniture, till you come. I shall make a little Establishment for , and keep Bachelors Hall for some time. We have no Authentic News from  Europe. These long East Winds may bring Us some thing. I have procured Some Horses and a Carriage, and ride on Horse back as often as the Weather will permit. I sent you the last Letters from our sons  about the middle of Decr. Mr. Murray is to go to  Holland and Mr. Dandridge as his secretary so that  will come home, directly I hope. I would not even Advise him to go  France. I hope to have one of my Children near me. It would have given me great Pleasure to have had some of my Family present, at my Inauguration which was the most affecting and over powering Scene I ever acted in. I was very unwell had no sleep the night before, and really did not know but I should have fainted in Presence of all the World. I was in great doubt whether to Say any Thing or not besides repeating the Oath. And now, the World is as silent as the Grave. All the Federalists Seem to be afraid to approve any Body but Washington.  The Jacobin Papers, damn with faint praise, and undermine with Misrepresentation and Insinuation. If the  go to playing Pranks I will resign the office and let Jefferson lead them to Peace, Wealth and Power if he will. From the Situation, where I now am, I see a Scene of Ambition, beyond all my former suspicions or Imaginations. An Emulation which will turn our Government topsy turvy. Jealousies and  have been my Theme and Checks and Ballances as their Antidotes till I am ashamed to repeat the Words: but they never Stayed me in the face in such horrid forms as at present. I see how the Thing is going. At the next Election  England will sett up Jay or Hamilton and  France Jefferson and all the Corruption of  Poland will be introduced. Unless the American Spirit should rise and say we will have neither John Bull nor Nicholas Louis Boborn. Silence.  "

","My dearest Friend Last night for the first time I slept in our new House. But what a Scene: The Furniture belonging to the  is in the most deplorable Condition. There is not a Chair fit to sit in. The Beds and Bedding are in a woeful Pickle. This House has been a Scene of the most Scandalous Drinking and Disorder among the servants, that ever I heard of. I would not have one of them for any Consideration. There is not a Carpet nor a Curtain, nor a Glass nor Linnen nor China nor any Thing. Dont expose this Picture. This morning I received  your  of March 12  and  13th . I am highly pleased with your Criticisms and Observations on my Adieus to the Senate, their Answer and my Reply. Before now you have a long Speech, which I hope you will  descant on as learnedly and ingeniously. As to the farms I must leave all to you and Dr. Tufts. Let Trask clear all the Bushes in Curtis's Pasture. I want to have clean Work made there. You have not mentioned My Mares nor Colts. Are the Mares in a Way to breed Us Horses? I have procured five Horses, which with my little fellow at home, will be all I shall keep. As to Public Affairs all is  at present. Nothing can be determined till further and more Authentic Accounts arrive. I never wanted your Advice and assistance more in my Life. My Country will not always oblige her Public Men to make Brick without Straw. As soon as I shall be out of the Question, their Presidents will go on Swimmingly whoever Lives to See it. But it is wicked to complain. I have not been able to receive any Company. And the House will not be fit for some time.   I am with all Affection and ardent Wishes for your Society,  "

You must hire four Horses in  Boston and a Coachman to bring you here, upon as good terms as you can. James may ride my little Horse and Anthony you must give away. I am very unwell -- a violent cold and cough, fatigues me, while I have every Thing else to harry me: So that I must entreat you to come on as soon as you can. I shall send you some Post Note in a day or two. Prince's Time is out and he will be discharged. James may come on with you, and return immediately to  New York. I will not keep him a day. You may leave him at  New York and hire some one to ride on the Horse to this Town. I will not have my Family here ruined by these turbulent blacks. Give them their  handsomely and dismiss them. My  are so enormous, that my first Quarters salary will not discharge much more than half of them. You must come and see for yourself. The French Executive Directory, will take Care to make our public Path thorny enough and our Country men will make our private one uneasy enough. So We need not expect Beds of Roses nor Walks of Flowers. I have been obliged to decline Brother Cranches farm. It will involve me, and I cannot increase my Cares. I have and shall have quite enough.

NA,"Philadelphia April 3. 1797 My Dearest Friend Monday Morning the most agreeable in the Week because it brings me Letters from you, has not failed me . I have  yours of 23  and  25 March . The Correspondence with  Plymouth amused me much. The Answer is Superiour to the Letter both in Delicacy, and keenness. You might have told her, if Charles decides in Elections, it is no better than Descent. But she knows not what she wants. The Letter is the fruit of a mind poisoned with Envy, Malice and disappointed Ambition. I shall  a Post Note for 600. And I pray you to come on immediately. I will not live in this State of Seperation. Leave the Place to Jonathan and Polly, to Mears, to my Brother, to any body or nobody. I care nothing about it. But you, I must and will have. My Duty to . I hope to see her in the Autumn. But alass my healthy Walks and rides over  Pens Hill and  Peacefield Hill, will be wanting all the Spring and Summer. And I fear for my health. My Application to Business, of a very dry, dull and perplexing nature is incessant. The Papers I have  to read and judge of, are so numerous, that it is Business enough for any Mans Life. Besides it is enough compleatly to put out my feeble Eyes. The Writing I have to do is also a great deal. Indeed I expect nothing but to loose my health and be obliged to resign. Dont expose this croaking and groaning however. I should loose all my Character for firmness, if any one should read this. Indeed I sometimes suspect that I deserve a Character for Peevishness and fretfulness, rather than Firmness. I believe honesty is always anxious and consequently peevish and fretful. It is always afraid of doing wrong, or making mistakes. The Lady, you think so frail, is of one of those Families who have long thought a  in a British army a Superiour Being to a Coll. or a Senator in their own Country. Russell was a Dunce for marrying such a young Girl.  Governor Gill has sent me one of his  Princetown Cheeses, of such a Size as to require handspikes to manage it, according to Father Niles's old Story. Dolly I really think Acted wisely. She is certainly a Philosopheress. Ambition in her was  mortified and Subdued. Comfort was her Object. The Title, ""Lady Temple,"" Sounded, from the Lointain, with celestial Harmony in the Ears of Mrs. Russell. Aye! No Philosophy there! at all! at all! wicked Ambition! cruel Vanity! It is to avoid Such feelings as those expressed in your Letter from  Plymouth that Ladies make such Provision beforehand as Mrs. Temple has done. But Dolly is Superiour in Philosophy to Mercy or Betcy. Do you have a Care when your Turn comes, to imitate Dolly rather than either of the others, or rather old Mrs. Bowdoin, than any of them. You however will be in no danger. You have sons, a Daughter and Grand Children, who will inspire you with more Dignity of Conduct. You cannot mortify so many worthy Persons as owe their Being to you, so much as to disgrace yourself or them, or the Memory of  your affectionate   "

I am not inquisitive to learn, what Criticisms are made, upon my little harrangues, from any other motive than a desire to know whether any  was taken or whether any Satisfaction was shewn, and whether my avowed Principles and designs were approved. I have received Some rapturous Letters of Panegyrick far beyond the merit. The Times are critical and dangerous, and I must have you here to assist me. Pray prevail with Mears if you can. But leave it at all Events. The Plate had better be deposited with Dr. Tufts I believe. You may send my Black  and Velvet Suits on if you please. The  at War calls upon Business. "
NA,"Philadelphia April 7, 1797 My Dearest Friend I received   your favour of March 29th . I write you every Post day and send my Letter to the office. If they do not come regularly to you it must be owing to the office. It would hurt me to refuse the request of my Nephew Elisha Adams: but you gave him and his Mother all the Answer in your Power. If Dr. Tufts has any Money of mine in his hands, I should be glad if he would Supply my Nephew and take his Security. I never was in greater Straits for money in my Life, than at this time. I know not how to get along and expect to be obliged to borrow at the bank. But is is in vain to talk to the People about these Things. I want  and I want Exercise: but I want your Assistance more than either. You must come and leave the Place to the mercy of Winds. I will let them, the Places all out next Year for what they will fetch in money, reserving the house and Garden. You must come here and see, before you will have an Idea of the continual Application to Business, to which I am called. I should not have believed it possible for my Eyes to have read the Papers which are brought me every day and every hour of the day. I wonder not that my Predecessor was weary. Adets Visit was not in a public Capacity. He solicited a private Interview and I consented. The Purport was to clear up his Character. But it was of no Consequence. I shall not write about it. He is now soliciting Permission to call on me to take Leave before his Departure. It is hardly consistent to grant it. But I wont make difficulties and give them handles about such Trifles. Dont mention this. You must come, at all Events and leave the Place as you can -- nay if you leave it common and bring Mrs. Brisler and her children.   You must hire Horses as I wrote you. Tell Louisa We shall have a pretty Chamber for her. She will have the honour of sleeping and dressing and reading and writing in no less a depart an Apartment than that in which the celebrated Washington transacted all the Business of the Govt. But this must not be whispered. It will be tho't too irreverent. On the 4th. I  a Post note for 600. Make the best bargain you can for Horses. You must go for the Hot months to  East Chester, and keep your Horses at the Tavern and pay for your board. And I must go to the Faederal City. That must be my farm in future, and I shall have as much more plague as less Pleasure, in it, than I had in the  Quincy farm. You must get my Brother to board Billlngs. But I believe you must get Mears at least for this summer. I am determined not to be perplexed with Farms. Dr. Tufts may, Let all but the House for a Rent or upon shares or any Way. Come away and leave it to Chance. My Duty to my  Mother & love to my Brother and Neighbours and friends. It would give me great Pleasure to see them. But I fear it will not be possible this Year. Cousin Boylston was in the right. My farm would give me more Pleasure in a Week than my Office in four Years. Except that all the Pleasure of Life that is solid consists in doing ones duty. You invite me to write and you must take such Trash and I can write without thinking. Yet I think a great deal about you. I wish I could come to escort you but that is impossible. "
"Philadelphia  April 11. 1797
","My dearest Friend Your Letter of the 31. of March  made me unhappy because it convinced me that you were so. I attribute the Course of it all however, to the dangerous illness of Cousin Polly Smith which I am very sorry to hear. The Deaths and dangerous sicknesses of your near Relations and intimate friends always affect your tender and benevolent heart with very deep and affectionate Impressions. I hope she may still live, but if otherwise, Resignation is all our Resource. You had not received any of my Letters which urge your immediate departure for  Philadelphia. I must now repeat this with Zeal and Earnestness. I can do nothing without you. We must resign every Thing but our public Duties, and they will be more than We can discharge, with Satisfaction to ourselves or others I fear. Public affairs are so critical and dangerous that all our Thoughts must be taken up with them. A Letter received from  Albany a few days ago says  ""Perhaps no Person from the Days of  Noah, down to the present time, had ever a more important Trust committed to his Charge, in a more trying Crisis, than the one now devolved on you. The Eyes of the World are turned to you, with Anxiety to see, what Expedients can be devised, to extricate Us from the Precipice now before Us, to avoid the final and dreadful Appeal to Arms, especially without an Object, or a hope on our side of Avenging our selves or gaining any Thing by the sickening Contest -- but broken bones."" I must  you, to loose not a moments time in preparing to come on that you may take off from me every Care of Life but that of my public Duty, assist me with your Councils, and console me with your Conversation. Every Thing relating to the Farms must be left to our friends. You will find your Drawing Room furnished and the rest of the house, and servants and stables in tolerable order. My Love to all  and friends especially my Mother. Comfort her as well as you can. We shall take a Journey together, in August or as soon as Congress rises I hope.   I am unalterably your affectionate "
"Phila.  April 13. 1797
","   My dearest Friend My dearest Friend I shall be obliged, for what I know to resign in a few months for Want of : But with all the Wear and tear of Eyes in other Ways I find Strength enough left in them to write and send to the Post Office on the morning of every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday a few Lines for you. I have as yet no Acknowledgment of my first Courtship to you to come on immediately. Every Post since has carried a Repetition of it, and this is intended to  it with all Zeal. The Virginians say I have appealed to the heart of every American by calling Congress and I wish you to be present and see the operation of their hearts. We must trouble our Friends to have an Eye to our little Affairs at  Quincy and  Braintree. Polly Smiths sickness ought not to delay you. These mysterious enigmatical French men, will puzzle Us at least. Poor Edward Savil has fallen into their hands and not only been robbed of all his Property but mangled and every thing but murdered, in so shocking a manner, as if it had been done by the English, every Jacobin  would be full of it, for a year or two. The poor fellow cries and Swears, that if he could but be allowed to go and fight them and get his revenge by killing some of them he should be willing to die as soon as he had done it. There is more of the natural Man than of the Christian or Politician in this. I give him his Board and lodging till he can get a Passage home. I think he ought to shew his Arm and shoulder and back to Austin and Jarvis and the democratic and Jacobinic societies. Cousin Sumner is to be Governor I presume. Could the Jacobins find no more promising Candidate than S.? I have a fine Letter from  of 14. Jan. but I will keep it till you come  as an additional motive to you to make haste. The  Conduct of our last house of Representatives have brought their Country into a very sober dilemma. If the People go on choosing such what will be the consequence? "

I hope you may have commenced your Journey before this day: but knowing how many dispositions you have to make, and how difficult it will be to make them I cannot promise myself the happiness of seeing you so soon. Your Solicitudes would be less if you were here. The Variety here would amuse you, and the Spirits of the gay enliven you, the Reasoning of the Wise assure you. Your narration of your Agricultural Management delights me and the picture of Billings's circular Wall, or oval Wall as he calls it charms me. We shall see it again I hope in August. But this will depend upon Congress and Intelligence from  Europe. Oh what an enchanting Summer I should have had, if  had been P. and I, V.P.! But never mind that. We will do our Duty as We are and he could do no more. On the 4th. I enclosed you a Post Note. I have received a Chronicle , by which I perceive that French those who profess so much Attachment to  France, so much devotion to the french Revolution and so much Enthusiasm for the french Republic are very much afraid that the Voice of the People will be for War. They need not fear that War will be sought. If it comes of itself and We cannot avert it, We must make the best of it, unpleasant as it is. Poor Ed. Savil would be glad to revenge himself at the hazard and for ought I know at the fire of his Life. Jarvis and Austin should see his back.  I have received the Lt. Governors Cheese -- like a charriot fore wheel boxed up in Wood and Iron. It will last till you come. I am grieved for Mary Smith: but think you ought not to tarry on her Account. You can do her no good that others cannot do. My Duty to . Love to Brothers and friendship to Neighbours. "

Whether he will get to  Quincy before your departure is uncertain. We shall suffer cruelly here for Want of him, But must do the best We can. As to sending Horses and Coachman from this Place to  New York. I fear it will be bad Economy. My Horses are so young that it will hurt them: besides how to get the Harness on? I am pleased with all your Arrangements. I know you have Perplexities enough. And I have my share here, public and private. You must get my Brother to board Billings I believe if you can. I shall long regret that I cannot pursue my Plan of fencing my Place with Wall. But my present situation calls for every Moment and every Thought. I shall give up Billings with great Regret. The Mail for  Quincy is made up but once a Week I have discovered, so I shall send my Letters to  Boston in future. My Eyes will totally fail me in six months. I shall be obliged to resign for Want of sight, if I go on as I begin. The Number of Papers to read is prodigious. My Eyes complain most bitterly.

I dont know but I shall send My Coachman and Horses to  Paulus Hook for you, with a Man to ride on my little Horse. James you will discharge I suppose; but as you please. James would ruin this family, I fear. Let me know when you shall be at  N. York. I will Let you know whether you may wait for my Horses, or whether you must hire at  N. York.

As You intended to commence your Journey on the 24th. it is not probable this Letter will meet you, till it returns to this Place. But as it is possible you might not be able to set out so soon, you may receive it at  Quincy. Brisler is at  Quincy before this, I hope.  is just gone, for  N. York. I have communicated to him my Plan of sending my Coachman and Horses to  Paulus Hook for You. I shall be obliged to send a Man or Boy with the Coachman and that Man or boy may ride my little Horse, which James rides to  N. York. I Suppose you will give James his Time, with his Cloaths &c. I however shall leave it to you. I fear he will Spoil our whole House, if he comes here. He has been so indulged like a Baby. Let me know when you shall be at  N. York. You may write me indeed from  New York. The Letter will come to me in a day. But it will take two days for my Horses to go from hence to  Paulus Hook. If however you should by any Letter I may receive next Week, inform me on what day you shall arrive at  N. York I could send my Horses early enough to be at  Paulus Hook as soon as you will be in the City.

Do you think mine less severe, public or private My dear and venerable  -- Alass -- I feel for her. She can complement her daughter yet -- that is a good Sign. As to the Husband it Seems to me that the Mother and the Daughter ought to think a little of the President as well as the Husband. His Cares! His Anxieties! his Health! dont laugh -- his Comfort -- that his head may be clear and his heart firm, ought to be thought on more than the Husband. Provide every Thing for my aged and worthy . I hope to see her yet again before October. You and Such petit Maitres and Maitresses as you, are forever  the Periods and Diction of Such great Men as Presidents and Chief Justices. Do you think their Minds are taken up with such Trifles. There is solid, keen, deep sense in that Morsel of Elsworths. You ought to be punished for wishing it not published. I warrant you, I shall soon be acquitted of the Crime of Chronicle, Argus and Aurora praise. Let it run its rig however -- and say nothing at present. Your moral reflections on worldly Possessions and earthly Comforts -- your look into futurity for brighter Scenes and fairer Prospects are wise. You cant imagine what a Man of Business I am -- how many Papers I read and how much I write, every day. I fear you will effeminate me when you come. I have determined to Send my Coachman and Horses to  Paulus Hook, for you. As soon as I know the day you will be ready to get Your Coach over to the Hook I will  to contrive that the Horses shall be ready, to be harnessed at you command.

","My Dearest Friend You never received a Letter from  Berlin but with Pleasure: and this I dare say will not be the first. From Austins in a lowry Morning We proceeded to  Hartford and dined at Bulls. A polite Invitation from the County Court to dine with them was declined, and We came on immediately to Squire Rileys. The Coachman thought it would be too hard upon the Horses to go to  Wallingford. I have now read all the News from the  Boston Paper of Monday and am more of a Pyrrhonest than I was when I read it partially at Flaggs. We have been highly  in the Weather for four days and have done well to get as far as this Place. We have glided along unforeseen, unexpected, and have avoided all Noise, show, Pomp and Parade. This We could not have done if We had been favoured with the Company of a single Lady. I want your society, Advice and Assistance however so much that I should be willing to ride but fifteen Miles a day, to obtain it. But ! I hope you have received a Letter from me every day for I have written one at least. I have none from your hand nor Mrs. Smith nor Louissa. By this time I hope I may wish Betcy Joy, which I do sincerely. Mr. Foster will make her a happy Woman, if it is not her own fault, and she will make him a happy Man, if it is not his. My Head has been ad Nausaum to me ever since I left home. My 80 were laid out for a scourge. What I shall do I know not. I ride and live in pain. I would give all my Teeth to know whether you slept last night or will sleep to night. William is very attentive and obliging but like Dr. Arbathnot has his fault, a slouch in his Gait, which however I intend to cure.  "

","My Dearest Friend From Rileys in  Berlin, We went to  Newhaven 26 miles to dinner at your Friends Mrs. Smiths who were very respectfully inquisitive after your health, and very sorry to hear an Account of it from me, not so flattering. A Visit from Dr. Dwight detained Us  for a short time but We found enough to cross the Ferry over the  Housatonnoc by sunsett and soon reached Lovejoys in this Town. We had our Fire made in our Bedchamber and our Tea and Oysters Served up, When behold a Vision of the Night in the Forms of Mrs. Smith and the fair Caroline bolted in upon Us without the least previous notice or Suspicion. The first Sight convinced me that you was better than When I left you. The Ladies have born the Journey to Admiration, and Mrs. Smith is convinced as I am that the Stage is the easiest mode of travelling. I shall take them in my Carriage the rest  of the Way which is not more than fifty five or sixty Miles to  East chester. We shall not however reach Col. Smiths before Monday night, for my Horses have been pushed too much already. I rejoice to hear you are better, and now my most immediate Anxiety is for my dear Brother Cranch, who is represented by my Daughter to be very sick. I pray for his Recovery as well as yours. Generals Washington, Hamilton and Pinckney are at  Philadelphia, not waiting for me, I hope. Envoy Logan is said to be returned, for any Thing that I know  from the Directory to __  "

","My dearest Friend From Lovejoys at  Stratford We put off Mr. Shaw with a part of the Baggage by the stage for  East Chester. Mrs. Smith and the fair Caroline came with me to Norwalk to dinner at Gregories, where We were very comfortable. We rode in gentle snow and rain all day and Arrived at Webbs at Night, where We put up till Monday. My Horses want a day of rest. From  Quincy to  Stanford, within 22 miles of  East Chester in Six days is too much for Horses so fat as ours. Mr. Davenport came in and drank Tea with Us and was very conversable. Madam Gregory, Yesterday told Us how much she had been disappointed in our not stopping there as We went home, and took pains to convince Us that she was not attached to the French. The News Arrived at  New York by the Way of Greenock in  Scotland, From the Supplement to the  and the other french Papers of the 14, 15 and 16 of September, are some corroboration of the News arrived at  Boston last Sunday: But there is something very unaccountable, in the total Want of official Information. I have not received any Account from you since my Daughter left you. Indeed I could not expect any.  "

","My Dearest Friend We Spent Sunday at  Stanford at Webbs, went to Meeting forenoon and afternoon, and on Monday went to Dinner at  East Chester. Tuesday in a Violent Snow storm went into  New York. Dined and Slept at Charles's. Wednesday crossed the Ferry and went to  Elizabeth Town. This day We came five and thirty miles to this Place. From  New York our poor Horses have waded and dragged the Carriage through Snow banks and Mud, till I have dreaded their failure. They have Supported the fatigue however a mervaille and even Sloan as lean as a lath has brought along Frank in the Saddle very well. We have yet five and thirty miles to  . I hope to reach McElroys tomorrow and go into the City on Saturday. Mr. Shaw has been very good and the Coachman and Footman or Horseman have done their duty with great Care and Fidelity. I have heard nothing from you since Mrs. Smith left you, and I have Anxieties enough on your Account, as you may easily imagine. I have no news from Brisler and know not the Condition of the House, but I shall alight at the Door on Saturday. All Ideas of the Fever both at  New York and  , are lost and nobody Speaks of it now. We had Scarcely become warm at our Fireside, when Mr. and Mrs. Liston and Lord Henry Steuart came in travelling also to  . They used a Slay for the first time of their Lives to day. Very polite Inquiries after your health. You cannot be thankful enough that you did not attempt to come on. Adieu, my Dear Friend.

This was done by Invention as I will explain some other time. I found all well and in good order and I slept soundly last night, the House looks to me like a Desart. I pray that you may have Slept as well as William and myself.

Phil.  Nov. 28. 98
","My dearest Friend I have received yours of 18th and none later. Your Company here is much desired by every body: but by none so much as me. My Occupation in Business is so incessant, that I could have little time to pass with you, but that little every day would be  and invaluable. You express a Willingness to come on: but the thought of your attempting it without consulting your Friends and Physicians, distresses and terrifies me least it should prove fatal to a Life that is dear to me beyond all Expression. If however your Physicians are of Opinion, that you can come on by easy Journeys, in any Way you can think of, your Arrival here will be an inexpressible Satisfaction to me. But if you Attempt to come without a fixed Resolution to take Care of your Health and renounce those fatigues of public places, Drawing Rooms, great Dinners &c. I am  very apprehensive that this Winter will be your last. A Constitution so wrecked and exhausted as yours has been by a three months confinement, may be easily oversett. We are all well, and every Thing goes on very well. We had the Ministry and General Officers to dine on Monday and all .  I am with tenderness inexpressible ever yours,  "

","My dearest Friend Your Letter of the 25  has revived my heart. I rejoice at Your Recovery and hope it will be confirmed so that you may with the Advice of your Physicians come on this Winter to me. But I cannot bear the thought of your Attempting it, without their Consent. I am of Opinion with our  about the Barn. Barlow to Baldwin I have seen and despise the Letter as much as I have for some Years scorned the Man. Mrs. Morris enquired by her son Robert very civilly and I believe sincerely after your health. I have not seen a Female, except Mrs. Otis, Since my Arrival. The . and Sens. will miss you I warrant. All Enquire anxiously and honestly after you. I would not be a David for the Universe. The young  would plague me to death. If you come on, you must expect to find me cross. Sam. Adams Says Old Men are fractious and appealed to his Wife, if she did not find it so. I shall be more fractious than he, I fear for I shall be plagued. "

But I hope for a Letter to Day. I am almost afraid to send you the enclosed Letters. Yet I think I ought not to  them. I hope every day to hear of our dear Thomas's Arrival. I have had a cold as usual upon coming to this place: but ventured out to make my Speech and am much better. I almost dread to hear of your Attempting to come on. A Journey of 360 miles through bad roads and worse weather requires more strength than I fear Disease has left you. It is not long to March or April. I know you have certain Ideas that you have a Post and that you ought to be at it. But these Duties are  by Necessity, and your obligations are stronger to prepare a Life, that is so necessary to me, than to hazard it for a three months attendance at this place. My Relations have no scruple to put my Feelings to the . Many of them are soliciting Plans. The Senate looks with Vengeance on every such Idea. I am convinced that if I were to nominate Col. Smith to be a Lt. Colonel he would be again negatived. Nay if I were to nominate him to be a Lieutenant I dont believe he would pass.   I am with unabatable Affection,  "

","My Dearest Friend Your Letters of  29, Dec. 2. and 3 affect me very tenderly. The low Spirits, Effects of long and exhausting sickness are apparent: but these are Evils of a serious nature. I pray you to banish as much as possible all gloomy Thoughts and be very cautious to avoid every thing which may endanger a return of your old Disorders. To reconcile you to your fate I have a great mind to give you a detail of mine. A Peck of Troubles in a large Bundle of Papers often in a hand Writing almost illegible, comes every day from the Office of  Office of  Office of &c. &c. &c. Thousands of sea Letters Medeterranean Passes and Commissions and Patents to sign. No Company. No society. idle unmeaning Ceremony. Family Vices, Follies, Extravagance, shiftlessness and Health, sinking for what I know under my Troubles and fatigues.  You and I, seem to have arrived prematurely at the Age when there is no pleasure. All this is not the Resignation of Socrates. I cannot encourage the Idea of your coming on to  . The horrid Roads and cold damp Weather would put an End to you. I hope our dear Thomas will arrive and  you up.  I am with unalterable affection,  "
Dec. 14.  [17 ]98,"My Dearest Friend Rejoice with me, that I have this Day finished my Ceremonies with the two Houses. Their Answers to the Speech have been civil and I have given them civil Replies. My St. Anthonys fire attacked me again after I had been here a few days. But it has given me no Pain and is better--almost gone off. It must be the Air or Water of this place that gives it me. The  will dispute about the Alien and Sedition Laws all Winter I suppose.  France seems to have lost all her Friends. Bonapartes Mussellman Proclamation has done something. The D l! say some. What! renounce the Cross! and then take up the Crescent! that is too much. Rush says there is not one Frenchman left among all his Acquaintance. I hope the Lumber is all up. Mr. Porter must have had a bad time to cart it. It would be nonsense to couple a fine barn with my hut. I shall make it plain and coarse: but 20 foot Post if you will, and by all means on a line with  the front of the House. I know what to do with the space between the Barn and the Road. We had last night a mighty Rain. The hot dry summer has made the House leaky and We were deluged almost. The everlasting Damps in Winter in this Town would give you the Ague. We have not one Day nor Hour of dry Air. The Barn I suppose will take up much time: but I am determined to do something at Manure if I can in the Spring, Summer and fall. Billy Shaw is very good. Goes to the Senate with Messages manfully. But the solitude in which I live is curious. The dangerous Vice is not arrived. If I was ever absent so long  they did not Spare to confuse me. But nothing is now Said. How I long to hear that our dear Thomas is by your fire Side: How I long to hear that Mr. Cranch is well and Boylston Adams recovered? My Love to them all. Louisa I know is glad she is not in  . She never seems at her Ease here and I applaud her Taste. We go on, very smoothly. Brisler keeps all in good : but he groans for Ma'am. January One February two. No more Months. Perhaps I must reckon part of March. I have been five Weeks from you next Monday -- three Weeks here this night. Next Fall We will come on earlier. If the Yellow Fever keeps Us out We will go to  Bethlehem, or the Federal City. You went into your Kitchen to make  and Pies too son. I suspect too you went even to Church before you ought. You are an imprudent Lady in the Care of your health.  Washington is gone to  Mount Vernon to day. Gen. Pinckney goes to  Charleston next Week.

","My Dearest Friend With a great deal of snow upon the Ground it is now plentifully snowing. There must be an unusual Quantity upon the Earth. I suppose you have it very deep. Our Men and Teams must have had a terrible  to get the Lumber home: but I hope it is all compleated e'er this. To Day at two Dr. Ewing and Mr. Snowden are to dine with me and tomorrow at four about 30 Senators and Reps. I have not had as yet any Tuesdays or Saturdays Parties: and I believe I will not have any. There is too much familiarity at them: they sit too late. The last Letter from you was dated the 9th. I admire Your taste for Weddings. I hope you will marry Louisa and Betcy Howard and all the single ones who are ripe. I am sorry for Louisa at  Berlin. But I have  more than enough. I dont want any more. Yet I should like that John should have a son and a Daughter. But I cannot bear the trouble of Children at my House.  In short I have enough of Children as well as Grand Children. My Daughter and one son, will bring down my Grey Hairs with sorrow to the Grave, if I dont arrouse all my Phylosophy. The Daughter too without a fault. Unfortunate Daughter! Unhappy Child! I begin to doubt whether I was in the Way of my Duty in ever engaging in public Life. With my Family of Children ought I not to have  at home, minded their Education and sought their Advancement in Life! It is too late for this Cemistry now. The Die is cast and I am not far from the End of my Life. I have done all for my Children that I could: and meant all for the best. What have I not suffered? What have I ever enjoyed? Still my Enjoyments have been upon my farm. Oh that my Children and Grand Children were all Farmers! I am anxious and impatient to hear of the Arrival of Thomas. Is Master Cleverly dead?

","My dearest Friend I have received your Letters of 10, 15, and 16. Your solicitude for my Health may subside. I am pretty well. I had a cold, not a bad one, and something of the Inflammation in my face of last spring, but it is gone. Rush gave me such a Dose of Salts that I thought it not fit to go out to Congress next day. But the day after I was well enough. I am Old, Old, very Old and never shall be very well -- certainly while in this Office for the Drudgery of it is too much for my Years and Strength. The Barn must not be a monument of Foppery. I should be content to have it 16 foot Post. But if it is thought Advisable I Suppose We can  at  Boston or from the Eastward new Posts long enough for twenty feet. I protest against two Buildings, and all expensive ornament. My Fortune is small -- Family large -- and expensive -- and shiftless Children and Grand Children enough to distract me. A fine Barn coupled with my Hut would be a Womans head on a fishes shoulders. Let me Spin an even thread of Plainness thro Life. It is Christmas and a fine Day. I rode yesterday, fourteen miles and intent as much . Our Family is very quite. No  No Complaints. An hundred and twenty Leagues in this cold season would be a terrible risque for you, and only to be here three Months and then a worse Journey home. My Health would be no better for your being a witness of any Pains or Acks I might have. I have had recourse to an old Medicine, Sulphur, Cream of Tartar and honey which has done me more good than Lockier or Rush. I Sleep well, appetite is good, work hard, Conscience is neat and easy. Content to live and willing to die; So I Sincerely think. Hoping to do a little good, able to do very little, perplexed and embarrassed very often by the Folly of some, the Intrigue of others, and the Selfishness and Ambition of many. Our  Field I see is gathered at length to his Fathers. Away they all go, the old People, and the Young ones come tottering on. I write you nothing about public affairs because it would be Useless to copy the Newspapers which you read. And I can say nothing more.  "
Christmas 1798,"My Dearest Friend I have rode in the Coaches with Mr. Shaw over Grays Ferry and round by Hamiltons Woodlands over the Upper Ferry home, about ten miles Kiggin says. More  Slaying never was seen. The snow not as with you excessively deep, but enough to cover all the Earth and deep enough to afford a very smooth path and beautifully white as Innocence itself. Yet the sun melts the Snow and it runs from the Roofs and fills the Air with a Chilly Vapour which destroys the Comforts as well as beauty of Winter in this place. How soon a warm rain and thorough Thaw may happen to break all up and make the Roads impossible, none can tell. Christmas is arrived but I dont hear of  Arrival at  Newbury Port. I hope you have before this: but if you have not dont be anxious. Long Passages very long are very frequent at this season. "

","My Dearest Friend I hope you have health enough to bear to share with me some of my Griefs. I have determined to do a Thing this day, which puts my  to a Tryal. The Lt.Gen. and Major Generals have recommended Col. Smith to the Command of a Regiment. This is a Degradation of him to which I would not consent, without his Consent. I have written to him hoping that he would forbid the nomination. But his Pride is humbled to that degree that he writes me he will accept. It would give me less Pain to follow him to the Grave: but I know not but he and his Connections would blame me, if I refused, and I have concluded to send in the nomination. His situation will be miserable, under the Command of his former equals and Inferiours. The Prejudices against him are such that I think it problematical whether the Senate will not again Negative him, and I am sure if they do it will give me no pain. If he has forfeited his Character for Integrity and Honor he ought not to have a Regiment: if he has not he deserved a Brigade, and more. Happy Washington: happy to be Childless: My Children give me more Pain than all my Ennemies. If Smith has forfeited  his Honor, I wish some kind friend would have given me the Facts and the Proof. In such a Case I would not nominate him to be a Lt. But no such fact or Proof has been presented to me. There was not a Line of Recommendation of W. Smith to be Loan officer of  . But if there had been many I could not have nominated him. There were as many Candidates as for the Treasury of the Mint and these among the most respectable Natives of the state. I long to hear of Thomas. Providence has preserved your Family you say. Ay and in many more and much greater dangers at sea, than you have any Idea of. Why should I distrust? I do not. I have been preserved, almost miraculously preserved, I hope for some good, and not merely to be punished with the Knowledge of the Disgrace of my Children. My  I see are destined to be the poorest Objects in the Community. Partly in Grief and partly in Indignation,  I am your ever affectionate  "

Thirty or forty Gallons of Punch, Wine in Proportion: and Cake in Abundance. The News by The  America Captn. Jenkins arrived at  Newbury Port made every body gay but me. Not a Word of Thomas Boylston Adams. I shall be uneasy till I hear further. He could not be so imprudent as to omit that oppertunity. You have an Admirable Faculty of employing your Mind. And in the Affairs of the farm materials for it. I want , but fear, if she should attempt to come here she would not talk farther than  Worcester or  Springfield. But my Wife, was too studious and addicted to scribbing to talk much to me when she was here. Our People grow amazingly fearless and valiant in Proportion as they hear the English beat the French: and that  Combinations are forming against them by  Turkey,  Russia,  Austria and  England. I dont like this bravery which grows in Proportion as Danger appears to lessen. I like that Fortitude which increases as Danger grows, in a good Cause. The English have exhibited an amazing Example of skill and Intrepidity, Perseverance and Firmness at sea. We are a Chip of that Block. And We could do as We pleased at least as We ought upon the watery Element, if it were not that We shall excite Jealousy in the English Navy. We must however, Stand for our Right. We must adopt their Motto Dieu et mon Droit. Pray desire Dr. Tufts to write to the Eastward for twenty foot Posts for my Barn. I have received his Letter about Turell Tufts and shall attend to it. His Letter is written in the hand for a young Man of 25.  Yours forever be ever,  "

After he shall have been some time at  Quincy I hope to hear that your health is quite established. He seems determined to settle in   and will come back to this place about the time that I shall leave it.

By this means he will escape the Dangers of our  Massachusetts Bay; and I hope soon to hear of his Arrival. The General Officers nominated Smith for the command of a Regiment. I nominated him to the senate who, after a warm opposition and a day or two's debate consented to his Appointment. His Pride is capable of stooping very low, or he would not have consented to be nominated. Let him run for Luck. All the Actions of my Life and all the Conduct of my Children have not yet disgraced me so much as this Man. His Pay will not feed his Dogs: and his Dogs must be fed if his Children starve.

The Price will be twice or thrice the Worth and I have no desire to enlarge my Borders by purchasing such scraps. Indeed I have land enough and too much, unless I could attend to its cultivation. In that Situation Land is an Object of Envy. And I am willing that some Tradesman should have it, who may build an house upon it. If Mrs. Veseys Place was to be sold all together, I would give a good Price for it: but not such a Price Pr Acre. But to buy it in Scraps is what I dont incline to do. My Intention is to lay out something in manuring what I have: but I am not anxious for more. Besides We have an expensive Prospect of building before Us in the Spring and I dont choose to Streighten my self.

Judge Cushing dined with me yesterday. Mrs. Cushing is well. They have had a  in  Virginia and have returned in good health. I have not seen the Judge look better. The Judge had a Visit in  Delaware from Mr. John Dickenson, the old Farmer of Pennsylvania. We must wait with Patience for the ship Alexander Hamilton  Clark to arrive at  New York, with her Passenger. But an important Question . Ought he to visit Father or Mother first? I believe he must come here before he goes to Quincy. But I shall leave it to him, to decide. Cracky Logan has answered his own End by obtaining an Election. But Talleyrand Seems ashamed of him. In the Dict. Historique Article Boyle is a Case in Point. Mr. Halwein Burgomaster of  Dort,  entered into a kind of Negotiation with Amelot, Ambassador of France in  Switzerland, to make Peace. He was arrested for this Misdemeanor and condemned to Imprisonment for Life and the Confiscation of all his Estate. And Boyle the Pyrrhonian Dictionary Man was expelled from his Professors Chair at Rotterdam and deprived of his Pension because he was Suspected of perswading many Persons to fall in with the Views of the Pseudo Peacemaking Burgomaster. In our Day John De Neuville and Mr. Pensionary Vanberckell were terribly threatned, for a similar Folly with William Lee. And nothing but the War with England probably Saved them.  "

This Moment they brought me from the Post Office a Letter from our dear Thomas dated the 12 informing me of his Arrival at  New York. He will come on to  Phyladelphia and only laments that he cannot have the pleasure of embracing both his Parents at once. His Passage has not been uncommonly long tho the Weather must have been turbulent enough. From the bottom of my heart I rejoice at this happy Event, which has dissipated a gloom which hung over and surrounded me. Both the N. York News papers announces his arrival in a pleasing Style, for which I give them credit. You must be patient and not be too much in Haste to embrace him. He must stay with me, sometime. We will write you all our Plans and Speculations. We have had a thaw and long rains for many days which must have injured the Roads so that I cannot foresee when he will arrive but I hope it will be soon enough to dance at the Ball, which will be on Wednesday night the 16th. At a time when I am necessarily deprived of the Company of all the rest of my Family I consider this Arrival as a Choice Pleasure and a great Consolation. You will have received a Letter from him no doubt before this will reach you. Think of Us and rejoice with Us. I dont wonder that Mr. Cranch is disposed to see his  of the Prophecies confirmed. The twelve hundred and thirteenth or fourteenth Year of the Hegira approaches near the End of the 1260 days. Less than half a Century has Mahomet to be believed a Prophet, according to Mr. Cranch.

I was not long in mounting the escalier and had the high Pleasure of embrasing  after an Absence of four Years and an half. We had a very happy Evening and he has had a real nights rest after the fatigues of his Passage and Journey. He seems in good health and is very little Altered in stature, shape or Feature. His Mind is well stored with Ideas and his Conversation entertaining. This Evening he goes with me to the Ball. I had rather spend it with him at home.

I may Say the Same and have the honor to resemble him in this particular: But I shall never imitate his Idolatry for Voltaire. His Materialism appears to me very Superficial. He insists upon being all matter, without knowing what matter is. The Monades, the Etres simples, the Atoms, the Molecules organniques, all these Groupes and Factions are as nonsencical as the Occult qualities. Human knowledge cannot penetrate so deep. I was profoundly learned in all that Jargon at twenty Years of Age. But found it all   Useless; and renounced it, for Fee simple and Fee tail.

I have avoided the Epithets perfidious and unprincipled as much as I could, but neither they nor any that would be borrowed from the Hebrew and the Greek would be too strong, for the House of Mass. to Use. My Religion you know is not exactly conformable to that of the greatest Part of the Christian World. It excludes superstition. But with all the superstition that attends it, I think the Christian the best that is or has been. I would join with those who wish ecclesiastical Tyranny abolished, and the frauds of the Priesthood detested: But in this Country We have little of this.

The  swamp too is vastly too dear. My Gout for Land is much abated. They hold it at such a Price that it tastes too silverfish. I will be no part of Taxes of any kind, nor  of Blacksmith's Bills. I will have a Rent clear of all deductions. It may be let for 3 years. But I must have the salts Marsh at the farms and  Quincys Meadow and  Belchers Place. The Rent must be the less. I am glad the 20 foot Posts are to be sent for. I have made Turell Tufts a Consul at . , to my sorrow, but for your Joy will sett out this Week for  Quincy. He will stop at  N. York sometime. He dont relish the Idea of settling at  Quincy.  "

","My dearest Friend On Tuesday  left Us at Eleven in the stage for  New York and Boston and consequently  Quincy. I should have been glad to have held him till I could carry him with me: but I thought it my Duty to comply with his desire, both for his sake and yours. He Seems determined to settle in Phyladelphia. He would have a happier Life, and be a more important Man in  Quincy: But I must do and say as My Father did to me: leave him to his own Inclination and acquiesce in it as a dispensation of Providence. You will find him very agreable and pleasant. By the time he returns, I expect the Plague will drive him out, again. It is undoubtedly here lurking about the City all this Winter. Tarewell did not die of it: but I suppose of an an  tho they call it a Pleurisie. We had Yesterday a large Company: C. J. McKean and the Judges and Lawyers of  with some Members of Congress: all very agreable. I am reading the  of  Prussias Correspondence with Voltaire, D'Alembert &c. He is forever talking of his Age, Infirmities, Decline and Decay. He Memory is going. His Imagination is gone. His Teeth fail. His Limbs are stiff and goutty. He is broken. He is old, &c. &c. &c. Yet at last When he was really old and broken he could not bear to hear of it. His  was bad enough: tho not so bad is that of others then and since. His Wit is to me a little dull. His humour heavy. There is an Affectation of Gaiety, which however does not make the Reader very gay. Frank waits for my Letter.  "

An happy Sight of his Friends, will come of course, without Accidents. He found his Father, forty Years Older than when he left him, and if he finds his Mother advanced only ten, it may be an agreable disappointment to him. But if We should live ten Years longer I Suppose We shall begin like the Hors of Prussia to think ourselves young at least, not old. I rejoice that P. Willard is restored to his Family, Friends and the Public. Mr. Gerry has seen the Communication and the Annotations. I should be glad to know the public Opinion of both. I shall not commit to writing any Remarks upon the Conduct of such great Men as Ministers of state and Ambassadors.  I agree with you, that voluble old Women or handsome young ones, are the best Ambassadors to Some Courts and Governments. I wish some Power or other would send You to me in the first Character. Tell Mr. Porter that I wish to have the best manure upon the Hill and enough of it to give the Land a good dressing.  "

Dr. Tufts may draw.You had better engage the Oats. French may have Belchers place. Congress will not  longer than March: and I calculate upon Weeks too. But fear I shall be detained some time after Congress departs. Last night I must needs go to the Play and had near got sick. But going to Bed with only one dish of Tea and taking a Bowl of gruel this Morning before I got up, has cured me. Our Weather is too bad for exercise abroad. We had a great Rain last night, which has carried off all the snow, except the deep banks. Before this hour Thomas has seen you. He is fleshy and plump, but the Face is not yet ruddy. You will not persuade him to be a  Braintree Attorney like his father. The Quakers or the sisters, or Brothers, or somewhat have  upon his Attachments and  Phyladelphia must be tryed. I cannot converse much with the Ladies because I cannot Speak a Word without Pain. If Robespierre were to  off my head I should not feel half the Pain that I suffer every hour. In short I have as much cause to complain of Age as Charles Paxton or the King of  Prussia, who in every Letter at my Age, says We suis vieux, [casse,] gouteux, Mes Dents Son wont Ma Memoire est perdue, mon Imagination est mort"" &c. Nevertheless I could be comfortable with my Wife upon my farm. Perhaps however I should see a Ghost or a Spirit. But it is time for me to bid farewell to .

","My dearest Friend Your last Letter, which I have received was dated the 10th. I have one from Mr. Thomas at  Brookfield of the 8th. I hope your ill turn was soon over and that your health is reestablished. What the ultimate determination of our Son will be I cannot conjecture. I would not overpersuade him.   is on many Accounts, a good place. My Inclination as well as yours is for  Quincy: his for  Phyladelphia. Let him determine. If We were to live in  Phyladelphia for many Years I should have less Objection to his fixing here. We should enjoy his Conversation, some times. But this is impossible. I have no Idea that I shall be chosen P. a second time,tho this is not to be talked of. The Business of the office is so oppressive that I shall hardly Support it two years longer.  I must go to the Ball: where I Suppose I shall get a cold, and have to eat Gruel for Breakfast for a Week afterwards. This will be no Punishment. Since my nomination of Murray I have been advised by Some to name my son John  and Mr. King, with Mr. Murray. But I answer that the nomination of either Mr. King or Mr. Adams would probably defeat the whole measure. Rivalries have been irritated to madness and Federalists have merited the sedition Law and Cobbet the Alien Bill. But I will not take Revenge. I dont remember that I was ever vindictive in my Life, though I have often been very wroth. I am not very angry now, nor much vexed or fretted. The Mission came across the Views of many and stirred the Passions of men. This I knew was unavoidable. The Reasons which determined me are too long to be written. "

","My Dearest Friend I went last night to the Ball, where the Company Suffered more by the cold which was excessive than I ever knew any Company suffer in my Life. The Dancers only were comfortable. I came home and went into a warm bed and had a fine Perspiration, occasioned I believe by my drinking three Glasses of Madeira Wine at supper and two more after I came home, which has relieved me from all cold and I feel very well this morning. The Company owing to the Weather was not large. I am very anxious to hear from you having no Letter since the 10th. Your sickness last summer, fall and Winter has been to me the severest  I ever endured. Not that I am at this moment without other Tryals enough for one Man. I may Adopt the Words of a celebrated Statesman, whom however I should not wish to resemble in many Things. ""And now, good judge, Says he,  let me ask you, whether you believe that my Situation in the World is perfectly as I could wish it; whether You imagine that I meet with no shock from my Superiours, no Perverseness from my equals, no impertinence from my Inferiours? If you fancy me in such a state of bliss you are wide from the mark.""

","My dearest Friend I have just received yours of 14th. It has laid in the Post office I suppose since saturday. The subjects of  Agents are horrible to me. I will therefore dismiss them.  Predilection for Phyladelphia, I suppose will determine him.Alass! Nelly is married poor Boy! and I suppose some of the Six sisters will catch the Child in the Trap without a Groat and without Connections! This is to be my fate, throughout. Three are gone already that Way. The fourth will go. Blind, thoughtless, Stupid Boys and Girl! Frederic, Franklin and other Soidisant , insist that Nature contrives these Things with others to reconcile Men to the thought of quitting the World. If my Phylosophy was theirs I should believe that Nature cared nothing for Men, nor their follies nor their Miseries, nor for herself. She is a mighty Stupid Woman, sometimes beautiful and clever but very often diabolical. A kind of French  Republic, cunning and terrible: but cruel as the Grave and unjust as the Tempter and Tormentor. I believe nothing like this of Nature, which to me is a Machine whose Author and conductor is wise, kind and mighty. Believing this I can acquiesce in what is unpleasant expecting that it will work out a greater degree of good. If it were possible that I should be mistaken, I at least shall not be worse than these profound  I shall be in the same case hereafter, and a little, a great deal better here. The Report was not at last as it should have been: But it is very different from the Report made to me. I Scratched out, a little. I wanted no Report. In short it is one of those Things, that I may talk of, when I see you. After I sent that Report to Congress, I received a Letter, which has  Mr. Gerry's opinion and made against the Report. I have instituted a new Mission: which is kept in the dark, but when it comes to be understood will be approved. Oh how they lament Mrs. Adams's Absence! She is a good Councellor! If she had been here, Murray would never have been named nor his Mission instituted. This ought to gratify your Vanity enough to cure you.  Love to , Brothers, Cousins &c. Louisa especially.  "

I congratulate you and Louisa on this Event. I cannot say whether I shall see you in march. I have much to do. but neither a Sense of Duty nor the feelings of Inclination will be wanting to induce me to see you at  Quincy as soon as possible. I shall not go to  Washington. I cannot.

But we have a silly Insurgence in  Northampton County in this State, which will detain me, I suppose, some days. This State is not a moral  [person ?]it has not Intelligence enough to make it accountable for its Actions. I have received Thomas's Letter, with a very entertaining account of the [No transcription available -- see page image] by what you call the Master Stroke.

","My dearest Friend We arrived on the 10th. I, much oppressed by one of my great Colds, which is now going off. I could obtain only one little Room and one little bedroom but we can make a shift. I came here more loaded with Sorrow than with Rheum. ...Sally Opened her Mind to me for the first time. I pitied her, I grieved, I mourned but could do no more. A Madman possessed of the Devil can alone express or represent. I renounce him.  Davids Absalom had some ambition and some Enterprize. Mine is a mere Rake, Buck, Blood and Beast. To go from a private Calamity to a public the Fever in  is still bad, from ten to fourteen in a day. The great black frosts which freeze an Inch, are not come and they are necessary. They seldom come before the Middle of Novr. If the Weather has been as  in  New England as here, you will have a damp Journey and not pleasant Roads. I must be  from you a whole month, which will appear to me long enough.  "

",My dearest Friend I sent you a Letter this morning before I  yours of the 13. from Brookfield. I rejoice that you had arrived so far and born your Journey so well: but the weather has been so wet that I doubt whether you have been able to reach  East Chester to day. I am more convinced that the Air is a great Repository of Deseases and that it is impossible to guard against them. Be always ready. Yet I now fancy that if I had been prudent enough to put on my flannell and my Cloak I should have escaped my Cold till I reached the City. I hope I shall not have such another there. I know not whether a Yellow Fever would be a greater Evil than two such Colds. I am impatient to hear of your Arrival at  . You will find there Sally and her Mother and glooms enough. The Reprobate shall be punished. I shall mention no  nor News. We had a Frost last night black as well as white. But I doubt whether Such Frosts touch in   or  New York. An heat gets into the Air in great Cities that nothing but great frosts can affect. And even great frosts do not remove a thick damp putrid nauseous vapeur very deleterious to human Systems. Write me every day. You ought.  
"Trenton  October 18. 1799
","My dearest Friend I have written you but once since I bid you farewell. I was seized in  with one of those direful Colds, which have sometimes brought my frame into danger and I was afraid to let you know how ill I was. I am now so much better as to be able to do Business. We have no News of you since the ninth indeed since the Note in which you told us of James's fever. The weather has given us great anxiety in your account as well as much inconvenience on our own, ... If you are at  East Chester and have a mind to come nearer to  , you may find comfortable accommodations at Van Tilsbourgs at  Kingston where I can visit you every other day. I pray you to let me know when you intend to sett out from East Chester and where you propose to put up the first and the second night. I hope to see Brisler soon. We have cold nights and white Frosts, but black frosts are necessary and severe ones too, such as freeze half an Inch upon the Ponds, to cleanse the Atmosphere of those invisible Vermin that pray upon the Vitals of poor human Creatures.Brisler can have lodgings at Howells at the Ferry, till he can go to  Philadelphia.

"Trenton  October 21. 1799
","My dearest Friend I have no line from you, since the 13th at  Brookfield. There has been so much rainy weather as to have made travelling impracticable for you, some part of the time, and the roads  at all times... If your health fails not, Patience will bear the rest. We went to the Presbyterian Church yesterday and heard Mr. Grant a young  Presbyterian of a good style and fair hopes. Armstrong is sick confined with the Rheumatism as usual. Hunter and his Wife Mrs. Rush's Sister were at Church, I knew not why, as his Church is but 4 miles off, a Parish in this town. If this Day or Tomorrow does not bring me news of you, I shall begin to be in the horrors. If the Mumps are not uncommonly long lived on Brislers Children, he will be along . It is high time. Untill I turned over I knew not that the Sheet was mutilated. But still it will answer my End. The People with you are all Lazy. Louisa is as lazy as a Nun. Mr. Otis is not much better. If you had People of ordinary celerity about you, some one might write to me or William every day. You are generally as industrious as you ought to be. It is very fortunate however that you have Mr. Otis in Company. That family, besides his protecting care, will render the Journey much less tedious. You can have no Ennui with the little folks and the great folk about you. Not one word have you or any one else said to me of my farm since I left it .... Not one hint of my Buildings Walls, Harvest  or Manure &c &c &c. I want to know how the fence against Mr. Black went on, how the Buildings proceeded and whether the Hill was Spread. I must have an Agricultural Correspondent.  Mean time I am most affectionately  "

","My dearest Friend Your  of the 20th has been to  Phyladelphia and came back to me only last night: nor was this the fault of the Post Office. The Letter was addressed to  Phyladelphia. It gave me great Joy and relieved me from much anxiety. I had recd. no news of you since your Letter of 13 from Brookfield. We had a sharp frost last night. Ice this morning on a Tub of water at the Door, a quarter of an Inch thick. The Board of Health certify to Mr. Latimer that no pestilential Distemper prevails.... I shall be in no haste, however, to go in. I hope Brisler will be here soon. He may be accommodated at his old quarters at the ferry. It was fortunate that you had Mr. Otis's Company. My Cold is gone off. The kind Family where I am covered me with a bed of down, the finest Thing in the World. It has kept me warm, and with one Dose of Rhubarb and Calomel and another Medicine, which I will add to your Catalogue when I see you has cured me. You will do well to cross the North River at the New State Prison, over to Hoebucken, where is a good house.  You may come on as far as Vantelbourgs at  Kingston when you please. I will meet you there at least. Let me know when you intend to set out. Dont travel far in a day.William has not escaped a Cold: but his, has been very light. Our exclusive Federalists are almost as  as the exclusive Patriots. Some of them are very wild. They are absolutely sure that the French Republick will come to an End and Louis 18 be restored before the New Year. If this should be the Case, of which however there is little more probability than there is that the End of the World will come this year, our Envoys may wait for new Credentials and Instructions.

I am happy to know that you are comfortably situated. I pray you to live in all Things at your own Expence and be no Burthen to Mrs. Smith or the Lt. Col. I am pretty well recovered of my Cold, but it has reduced my flesh. James Has found a beautiful Pair of black Horses a perfect Match for ours and is distracted to persuade me to buy them. One is six years old the other 8. I think with you that the Second Week in November will be soon enough for us to enter the City. I am looking out for Brisler now every day. But am afraid that the Sickness of his Children may detain him longer than he intended. You alone might possibly live here with me for a Week: but Louisa and Betty could not be  accommodated.... You might all be well at Vantilburgs but I think it will not be worth your while to leave you present Situation. When Brisler comes on I shall write you more particularly. The next Winter will be the last we shall ever spend in  .... You will leave it early in April if you are wise, and you will come no more to the Southward, for one Year and an half at least. You will never think of going to George Town, upon Uncertainties, or rather upon the Certainty of leaving it on the 4th of March, with five hundred and fifty or Six hundred Miles to ride thro the Mud.

I can sent James with my Horses and Charriot to meet you at  Hoebucken Ferry or  Elizabeth Town or any other Place you may appoint and at any time you will appoint, if you can be sure of your Planns and measures. If Mrs. Smith and Caroline come on, you will want more room and more horses. Write exactly your determination. I have been  and  afternoon to Church to hearParson Waddell, who gave us two Discourses good and wholesome for soul, Body and Estate. He is a good Picture of ""Stalled Theology"" and said to have a good Estate. Last Sunday I went to the Presbyterian Church and heard Mr. Grant an ingenious young gentleman. There is Something more chearful and comfortable in an Episcopalian than in a Presbyterian Church .... I admire a great Part of the divine Service at Church very much. It is very humane and benevolent, and sometimes pathetic and affecting: but rarely gloomy, if ever. Their Creeds I could dispense with very well because, the Scriptures being before us contain the Creed the most certainly orthodox. But you know I never write nor Talk upon Divinity. I have had more than I could do, of Humanity. Benevolence and Beneficence, Industry, Equity and Humanity Resignation and Submission, Repentance and Reformation are the Essence of my Religion.Alass, how weakly and imperfectly have I

 fullfilled the Duties of my own Religion! I look back upon a long Life very poorly spent in my own Estimation. Busy as it has appeared to Some, to me it appears to have been very much too idle, inactive, slothful and sluggish. I fear it is too late to amend .... My Forces are far spent and by too much Exertion I should soon exhaust them all. I am not in the Vapours but in very good Spirits notwithstanding this penetent Confession of my faults.

Mrs. Washington and her whole Family very kindly enquired after your health and all your Children and Louisa; and send many friendly Greetings. I like the Seat of Government very well and shall Sleep, or lie awake next Winter in the Presidents house. I have slept very well in my Journey and been pretty well. An Abundance of Company and many tokens of respect have attended my Journey, and my Visit here is well received. Mr. Marshall and Mr. Dexter lodge with me at  Tunnicliffs City Hotel, very near the Capitol. The Establishment of the public officers in this place  has given it the air of the Seat of Government and all Things seem to go on well. I am particularly pleased with  Alexandria. Mr. Lee lives very elegantly neatly and  there among his Sisters and friends and among his fine Lotts of Clover and Timothy. I scarcely know a more eligible Situation. Oh! that I could have a home!

The Account you give of the  State of our dear Brother Mr. Cranch and his family is really distressing and must severely afflict you. I most cordially Sympathize with you and them. I have seen only Mr. Marshall and Mr. Stoddert, General Wilkinson and the two Commissioners Mr. Scott and Mr. Thornton. I shall say nothing of public affairs. I am very glad you consented to come on, for you would have been more anxious at  Quincy than here, and I, to all my other Solicitudines Mordaces as Horace calls them i.e. ""biting Cares"" should have added a great deal on your Account. Besides it is fit and proper that you and I should retire together and not one before the other.

It would be a great pleasure to me to go in it, but I am so engaged in indispensable business that I know not how to leave it and another thing of some importance is your Son may take a Seat with you and Suzan in the Charriot and that will relieve the Burthen of the other Horses a good deal. The Ancients thought a great Book a great Evil. Mr. H will find a little Book an evil great enough for him: for although it will probably answer it and with regard to me it will not answer his evil with Regard to another Gentleman: but will ensure the Choice of the Man whom he dreads or pretends to dread more than me. I am of opinion however that he would prefer Mr. J. to me. And so would Some others. Some of these are desirous of Confusion, and a dissolution of the Confederacy. Some in hopes of getting a new Constitution more to their Minds, Some  I fear in hopes of dividing the Continent, and Sitting up two or three Confederacies, and Some perhaps in hopes of making an Army necessary. The opposite Party too are divided into many Sects, as the World will see, if they succeed in their Choice. Their Man will not be found to be the Man of all their People: No nor a Majority of them. He is not thorough going enough. He is not daring and desperate enough. In short one half the Nation has analyzed itself, within 18 months, past and the other will analyze itself in 18 months more. By that time this Nation if it has any Eyes, will see itself in a Glass. I hope it will not have reason to be too much disgusted with its own Countenance. But I wander.

The Weather and roads here, on Saturday Sunday and to day are the finest we have seen this year. The Election will be decided this day in  of Mr. Jefferson as it is given out by good Authority. The Burden upon me in nominating Judges and Consuls and other officers, in delivering over the furniture, in the ordinary Business at the Close of a Session, and in preparing for my Journey of 500 miles through the mire, is and will be very heavy. My time will be all taken up. I pray you to continue to write me. My Anxiety for you is a very distressing addition to all my other . Our Bishop gave us a good discourse yesterday and every body enquired after you. I was able to tell them you had arrived on  night at  Baltimore.
