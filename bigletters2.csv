","My Friend If I was sure your absence  was occasioned, by what it generally is, either to wait upon Company, or promote some good work, I freely confess my Mind would be much more at ease than at present it is. Yet this uneasiness does not arise from any apprehension of Slight or neglect, but a fear least you are indisposed, for that you said should be your only hindrance. Humanity obliges us to be affected with the distresses and  of our fellow creatures. Friendship is a band yet stronger, which causes us to  [feel] with greater tenderness the afflictions of our Friends. And there is a  more binding than Humanity, and stronger than Friendship, which makes us anxious for the happiness and welfare of those to whom it binds us. It makes their  [Misfortunes], Sorrows and afflictions, our own. Unite these, and there is a threefold cord -- by this cord I am not ashamed to own myself bound, nor do I  [believe] that you are wholly free from it.  [Judge you then] for your Diana has she not this day  [had sufficient] cause for pain and anxiety of mind? She bids me  you that Seneca, for the sake of his Paulina was careful and tender of his health. The health and happiness of Seneca she says was not dearer to his Paulina, than that of Lysander to his Diana. The  often wants  repairing and if we neglect it the Deity will not long inhabit it, yet after all our care and solisitude to preserve it, it is a tottering Building, and often reminds us that it will finally fall. Adieu may this find you in better health than I fear it will, and happy as your  wishes you.  "

","You was  to say that the receipt of a letter from your Diana always gave you pleasure. Whether this was designed for a complement, (a commodity I acknowledg that you very seldom deal in) or as a real truth, you best know. Yet if I was to judge of a certain persons Heart, by what upon the like occasion passess through a cabinet of my own, I should be apt to suspect it as a truth. And why may I not? when I have often been tempted to believe; that they were both cast in the same mould, only with this difference, that yours was made, with a harder mettle, and therefore is less liable to an impression. Whether they have both an eaquil quantity of Steel, I have not yet been able to discover, but do not imagine they are either of them deficient. Supposing only this difference, I do not see, why the same cause may not produce the same Effect in both, tho perhaps not eaquil in degree. But after all, notwithstanding we are told that the giver is more blessed than the receiver I must confess that I am not of so generous a disposition, in this case, as to give without wishing for a return. Have you heard the News? that two Apparitions were seen one evening this week hovering about this house, which very much resembled you and a Cousin of yours. How it should ever enter into the head of an Apparition to assume a form like yours, I cannot devise. When I was told of it I  could scarcly believe it, yet I could not declare the contrary, for I did not see it, and therefore had not that demonstration which generally convinces me, that you are not a Ghost. The original design of this letter was to tell you, that I would next week be your fellow  provided I shall not be any encumberance to you, for I have too much pride to be a clog to any body. You are to determine that point. For your -- P S Pappa says he should be very much obliged to Your Cousin if he would preach for him tomorrow and if not  next Sunday. Please to present my complements to him and tell him by complying with this request he will oblige many others besides  my pappa, and especially  his Humble Servant,  "

","Sir How do you now? For my part, I feel much easier than I did an hour ago, My  haveing given me a more particuliar, and favorable account of the Small pox, or rather the operation of the preparation, than I have had before. He speaks greatly in favor of Dr. Perkins who has not, as he has heard lost one patient. He has had since he has been in Town frequent opportunities of visiting in the families where the Doctor practises, and he is full in the persuasion that he understands the Distemper, full as well if not better than any physician in Town, and knows better what to do in case of any dificulty. He allows his patients greater liberty with regard to their Diet, than several other physicians. Some of them (Dr. Lord for one) forbid their patients a mouthful of Bread. My unkle says they are all agreed that tis best to abstain from Butter, and Salt -- And most of them from meat. I hope you will have reason to be well satisfied with the Dr., and advise you to follow his prescriptions as nigh as you find your Health will permit. I send by  my  some balm. Let me know certainly what Day you design to go to Town, Pappa Says Tom  shall go that Day and bring your Horse back. Keep your Spirits up, and I make no doubt you will do well . Shall I come and see you before you go. No I wont, for I want not again, to experience what I this morning felt, when you left  Your  "

","Sir If our wishes could have conveyed you to us, you would not have been absent . Mr. Cranch and my Sister  have been here, where they hoped to have found you. We talk'd of you, they desire to be rememberd to you, and wish you well thro the Distemper.Mr. Cranch told me that the Deacon with his children design for  Boston next Saturday and that they propose going by water -- that the Deacon would have you go with them, but I would by no means advise you to go by water, for as you are under prepairation you will be much more exposed to take cold, the weather too is so uncertain that tho the morning may look promissing, yet you know it is frequently very raw and cold in the afternoon. Besides if you should wait till then and Saturday should prove an unplasent Day, you will make it so much the longer before you get into Town. Suffer me therefore to injoin it upon you, not to consent to go by water, and that you have no need to do as Tom will wait upon you any day that you desire. Let me know wheather you took your vomit, whether you have got your pills and whether you have begun Lent-how it suits you? I am very fearful that you will not when left to your own managment follow your directions --  but let her who tenderly cares for you both in Sickness and Health, intreet you to be careful of that Health upon which depends  the happiness of Your "

","My Dearest Friend Here am I all alone, in my Chamber, a mere Nun I assure you, after professing myself thus will it not be out of Character to confess that my thoughts are often  about Lysander, ""out of the abundance of the Heart, the mouth speaketh,"" and why Not the Mind thinketh. Received the  you so generously bestowed upon me. To say I Fasted after such an entertainment, would be wronging my Conscience and wounding Truth. How kind is it in you, thus by frequent tokens of remembrance to alleviate the pangs of absence, by this I am convinced that I am often in your Thoughts, which is a satisfaction to me, notwithstanding you tell me that you sometimes view the dark side of your Diana, and there no doubt you discover many Spots which I rather wish were erased, than conceal'd from you. Do not judge by this, that your opinion is an indifferent thing to me, (were it so, I should look forward with a heavey Heart,) but it is far otherways, for I had rather stand fair there, and be thought well of by Lysander than by the greater part of the World besides. I would fain hope that those faults which you discover, proceed more, from a wrong Head, than a bad Heart. E'er long May I be connected with a Friend from whose Example I may form a more faultless conduct, and whose benevolent mind will lead him to pardon, what he cannot amend. The Nest of Letters which you so undervalue, were to me a much more welcome   present than a Nest of Baskets, tho every stran of those had been gold and silver. I do not estimate everything according to the price the world set upon it, but according to the value it is of to me, thus that which was cheapest to you I look upon as highly valuable. You ask whether you shall send a History of the whole voyage, characters, visits, conversations &c. &c. It is the very thing that I  this Evening to have requested of you, but you have prevented my asking, by kindly offering it. You will greatly oblige me by it, and it will be no small amusement to me in my State of Seperation. Among the many who will visit, I expect Arpasia will be one, I want her character drawn by your pen (Aurelia says she appears most agreable in her Letters). I know you are a critical observer, and your judgment of people generally plases me. Sometimes you know, I think you too severe, and that you do not make quite so many allowances as Humane Nature requires, but perhaps this may be oweing to my unacquainedness with the World. Your Business Naturly leads you to a nearer inspection of Mankind, and to see the corruptions of the Heart,which [I] believe you often find desperately wicked and deceitful. Me thinks I have abundance to say to you. What is next? O that I should have been  glad to have seen you to Day. Last Fast Day, if you remember, we spent together, and why might we not this? Why I can tell you, we might, if we had been together, have been led into temptation. I dont mean to commit any Evil, unless setting up  late, and thereby injuring our Health, may be called so. To that I could have submitted without much remorse of Conscience, that would have had but little weight with me, had you not bid me adieu, the last time I saw you. The reflexion of what I that forenoon endured, has been ever since sufficient to deter me from wishing to see you again, till you can come and go, as you formerly used to. Betsy sends her Love to you, says she  to have kissed you before you went away, but you made no advances, and she never haveing been guilty of such an action, knew not how to attempt it. Know you of any figure in the Mathematicks whereby you can convey one to her? Inclining lines that meet in the same center, will not that figure come as nigh as any? What think you of the weather. We have had a very  afternoon, tho the forenoon threatned a Storm. I am in great hopes that Sol will not refuse his benign influence tomorrow.   you leave  Braintree. My best wishes attend you. With Marcia I say   Thus for  prays his  A Smith  PS Let me hear from you soon as possible, and as often. By sending your Letters to the Doctor believe you may get conveyance often.

Upon my hesitating-Send my Love say'd she to Mr. Adams, tell him he has my good wishes for his Safty. A good Night to you-my fire is out. Pray be so kind (as to deliver) or send if they dont visit you, these Letters as directed. What a Beautiful morning it is, I almost wish I was going with you.-Here  send the Books, papa prays  [you] would be careful of them. I send you some tobacco to smoke your Letters over, tho I dont imagine you will use it all that way. -- A pleasent ride to you.  Breakfast calls your "

","Sir Mr. Cranch informs me that Hones will go to Town tomorrow, and that I may not miss one opportunity, have now taken my pen to thank you for yours by Tom, and also for that which I have just now received by Mr. Ayres. You seem in high Spirits at which you know I rejoice. Your minute description of the persons you have seen, are very entertaining to me. I cannot consent you should omit writing, unless you find it prejudicial to your Health, if so I have not a word more to say. But, if amusement is all they require, why is not one amusement as good as , it may be those who forbid you cannot conceive that writing to a Lady is any amusement, perhaps they rank it under the Head of drudgery, and hard Labour. However all I insist upon is that you follow that amusement which is most  to you whether it be Cards, Chequers, Musick, Writing, or Romping. May not I hear from you by Hones? I shall take all possible care that the Letters I receive be well smoked before I venture upon them, enclose the Letters in a cover, but seal only the , Tom makes bungling work opening them, and tares them sadly. As to any other of the familys being endangerd by them, there is no fear of that, they  are very good, and let me enjoy my Letters to myself unless I vouchsafe they should see them. So Miser like I hoard them up, and am not very communicative. Your Mamma doubtless would rejoice to hear from you, if you write you may enclose to me, I will take good care of it, if you want any thing I can serve you in, let me know, have you milk ? You have a large number, who I suppose live upon it, write me if it would be agreable to You to have some. Tis meeting time, the Bell rings. Adieue, my Friend -- My add what else you please. And always believe me What I really am Your own My Love to Myra. We all desire to be  to you. Your Daughter Betsy is a charming Girl, and Lisps her Love to her papa.

","My Friend I think I write to you every Day. Shall not I make my Letters very ; don't you light your pipe with them? I care not if you do, tis a pleasure to me to write, yet I wonder I write to you with so little restraint, for as a critick I fear you more than any other person on Earth, and tis the only character, in which I ever did, or ever will fear you. What say you? Do you approve of that Speach? Dont you think me a Courageous Being? Courage is a laudable, a Glorious Virtue in your Sex, why not in mine? (For my part, I think you ought to applaud me for mine.) -- Exit Rattle. And now pray tell me how you do, do you feel any venom working in your veins, did you ever before experience such a feeling? -- This Letter will be made up with questions I fancy-not set in order before you neither. -- How do you employ yourself? Do you go abroad yet? Is it not cruel to bestow those  upon others which I should rejoice to receive, yet must be deprived of? I have lately been thinking whether my Mamma -- when I write again I will tell you Something. Did not you receive a Letter  by Hones? This is a right Girls Letter, but I will turn to the other side and be sober, if I can -- but what is bred in the bone will never be out of the flesh, (as Lord M would have said). As I have a good opportunity to send some Milk, I have not waited for your orders; least if I should miss this, I should not catch such . If you want more balm, I can supply you.

","Why my good Man, thou hast the curiosity of a Girl. Who could have believed that only a slight hint would have set thy imagination a gig in such a manner. And a fine encouragement I have to unravel the  as thou callest it. Nothing less truly than to be told Something to my disadvantage. What an excellent reward that will be? In what Court of justice did'st thou learn that equity? I thank thee Friend such knowledg as that is easy eno' to be obtained without paying for it. As to the insinuation, it doth not give me any uneasiness, for if it is any thing very bad, I know thou dost not believe it. I am not conscious of any harm that I have done, or wished to any Mortal. I bear no Malice to any Being. To my Enimies, (if any I have) I  am  willing to afford assistance; therefore towards Man, I maintain a Conscience void of offence. Yet by this I mean not that I am faultless, but tell me what is the Reason that persons had rather  themselves guilty, than be accused by others. Is it because they are more tender of themselves, or because they meet with more favor from others, when they ingenuously confess. Let that be as it will there is something which makes it more agreeable to condemn ourselves than to be condemned by others. But  it is vastly disagreeable to be accused of faults, yet no person ought to be offended when such accusations are deliverd in the Spirit of  Friendship. -- I now call upon you to fullfill your promise, and tell me all my faults, both of omission and commission, and all the Evil you either know, or think of me, be to me a second conscience, nor put me off to a more convenient Season. There can be no time more proper than the present, it will be harder to erase them when habit has strengthned and confirmd them. Do not think I . These are really meant as words of Truth and Soberness -- for the present good Night. What does it signify, why may not I visit you a Days as well as Nights? I no sooner close my Eyes than some invisible Being, swift as the Alborack of Mahomet, bears me to you. I see you, but cannot make  visible to you. That tortures me, but it is still worse when I do not come for I am then haunted by half a dozen ugly Sprights. One will catch me and leep into the Sea, an other will carry me up a precipice (like that which Edgar describes to Lear,) then toss me down, and were I not then light as the  [illegible]   Gosemore I should shiver into atoms -- an other will be pouring down my throat stuff worse than the witches Broth in Macbeth. -- Where I shall be carried next I know not, but I had rather have the small pox by inoculation half a dozen times, than be sprighted about as I am. What say you can you give me any encouragement to come? By the time you receive this hope from experience you will be able to say that the distemper is but a triffle. Think you I would not  endure a trife for the pleasure of seeing Lysander, yes were it ten times that triffle I would. -- But my own inclinations must not be followed -- to Duty I sacrifice them. Yet O my Mamma forgive me if I say, you have forgot, or never knew -- but hush. -- And do you Lysander excuse me that something I promis'd you, since it was a Speach more undutifull than that which I Just now stop'd my self in -- for the present good by.  Evening I hope you smoke your Letters well, before you deliver them. Mamma is so fearful least I should catch the distemper, that she hardly ever thinks the Letters are  purified. Did you never rob a Birds nest? Do you remember how the poor Bird would fly round and round, fearful to come nigh, yet not know how to leave the place -- just so they say I hover round Tom whilst he is smokeing my Letters. But heigh day Mr. whats your Name? -- who taught you to threaten so vehemently ""a Character besides that of , in which if I never did, I always hereafter shall fear you."" Thou canst not prove a villan, . I therefore still insist upon it, that I neither do, nor can fear thee. For my part I know not that there is any pleasure in being feard, but if there is, I hope you will be so generous as to fear your Diana that she may at least be made sensible of the pleasure. Mr. Ayers will bring you this Letter, and the Bag. Do no  repine -- it is fill'd with Balm. Here is Love, respects, regards, good wishes -- a whole  load of them sent you from all the good folks in the Neighbourhood.   makes the 14th Day. How many more are to come? I dare not trust my self with the thought. Adieu. Let me hear from you by Mr. Ayers, and excuse this very bad writing, if you had mended my pen it would have been better, once more adieu.

","Dear  Your Friendly Epistle  me a fryday morning, it came like an Infernal Mesenger, thro fire and Brimstone, Yet it brought me tidings of great joy. With gratitude may this month be ever rememberd by Diana. You have been peculiarly favourd, and may be numberd with those who have had the distemper lightest. What would I give that I was as well thro it. I thank you for your offerd Service, but you know that I am not permitted to enjoy the benifit of it. Yesterday the . returnd to our no small Satisfaction. I think there is but one person upon Earth, the Sight of whom would have more rejoiced me. But ""not Sight alone would please."" It would therefore be adviseable to keep at an unseeable distance till any approach would not endanger. I was yesterday at the Meeting of a Gentleman and his Lady. all shifted now no danger -- and no fear. A how do ye, and a how do ye, was exchanged between them, a Smile, and a good naturd look. Upon my word I believe they were glad to see each other. A tender meeting. I was affected with it. And thought whether Lysander, under like circumstances could thus coldly meet his Diana, and whether Diana could with no more Emotion receive Lysander. What think you. I dare answer for a different meeting on her part were She under no restraint. When may that meeting  be? Hear you have sent for your Horse, the Doctor tells me that you rode out a friday, do not venture abroad too soon, very bad winds for invalids tho I hear you stand it like an oak. -- O by the way you have not told me that insinuation to my disadvantage which you promised me. Now methinks I see you criticizeing -- What upon Earth is the Girl after. Where is the connexion between my standing the distemper like an oak, and an insinuation to her disadvantage? -- Why I did not expect that a short sighted mortal would comprehend it, it was a Complex Idea if I may so express myself. And in my mind there was a great connexion. I will show you how it came about. ""I did expect this purgation of Lysander would have set us on a level and have renderd him a Sociable creature, but Ill Luck, he stands it like an oak, and is as haughty as ever."" Now mentioning one part of this Sentance, brought to mind the accusation of haughtiness, and your faults naturally lead me to think of my own. But here look yee. I have more than insinuations against you. ""An intolerable forbiding expecting Silence, which lays such a restraint upon but moderate Modesty that tis imposible for a Stranger to be tranquil in your presence."" What say you to that charge? Deny it not, for by experience I know it to be true. Yes to this day I feel a greater restraint in your Company, than in that of allmost any other person on Earth, but thought I had reasons by myself to account for it, and 
Page 3
 knew not that others were affected in the same manner till a late complaint was enterd against you. Is there any thing austere in your countanance? Indeed I cannot recollect any thing. Yet when I have been most pained I have throughly studied it, but never could discover one trace of the severe. Must it not then be something in Behaviour, (ask Silvia, (not Arpasia for these are not her complaints) what it is) else why should not I feel as great restraint when I write. But to go on, ""Why did he read Grandison, the very reverse in practice. Sir Charles call'd forth every one's excellencies, but never was a thought born in Lysanders presence."" Unsociable Being, is an other charge. Bid a Lady hold her Tongue when she was tenderly inquireing after your wellfare, why that sounds like want of Breeding. It looks not like Lysander for it wears the face of ingratitude. -- I expect you [to] clear up these matters, without being in the least saucy.  As to the charge of Haughtiness I am certain that is a mistake, for if I know any thing of , he has as little of that in his disposition, as he has of Ill nature. But for Saucyness no Mortal can match him, no not even His Diana N.B. Remember me to  and Myra. Shall I hear from you by Mr. Ayers. If not do not fail writing by the Doctor who will be in Town a . If he brings a letter suppose he will smoke it too, you understand me. "

","My --  Your desire that I would write every Opportunity is punctually observed by me, And I comply with your request,  I have nothing more to say than How do ye? and when will you return? These questions perhaps may appear trifling to others, yet to me they are matters of the highest importance. The Doctor just now sent me your Epistle, and word, that  he had smoked it, yet he had not read a line. Very Good! --  I greatly rejoice to find you are so comfortable, as well as the rest of my Friends.  I hear is to return next week, and will not Lysander too? Yet do not, till you can come with the greatest Safety. For should I see thee, ""Were I  e'an in paradice I should leap the crystal walls."" Did not you receive a Letter this week by Mr. Ayers? You make no mention of it,  suppose You had not time, will you be so kind as to write by him tomorrow? For all those pleasureable Sensations, which you were pleas'd to say, a Letter from your Diana gave you, are enjoyed by her when Lysander favours her with an Epistle, and in as much gre greater a degree, as his are more worthy than hers.

Your Brother brought your Letter,  he did not let me see him, deliverd it the Doctor from whom received it safe. I thank you for your Catalogue, but must confess I was so hardned as to read over most of my Faults with as much pleasure, as an other person would have read their perfections. And  Lysander must excuse me if I still persist in some of them, at least till I am convinced that an alteration would contribute to his happiness. Especially may I avoid that Freedom of Behaviour which according to the plan given, consists in Voilations of Decency, and which would render me unfit to Herd even with the Brutes. And permit me to tell you Sir, nor disdain to be a learner, that there is such a thing as Modesty without either Hypocricy or Formality. -- As to a neglect of Singing, that I  to be a Fault which if posible shall not be complaind of a second time, nor should you have  had occasion for it now, if I had not a voice harsh as the screech of a peacock.

","I know not where this will find you whether upon the road, or at Phylidelphia, but where-ever it is I hope it will find you in good Health and Spirits. Your Journey I  must have been very tedious from the extreem heat of the weather and the dustiness of the road's. We are burnt up with the drouth, having had no rain since you left us, nor is there the least apperance of any. I was much gratified upon the return of some of your Friends from Watertown who gave me an account of your Scocial Dinner, and friendly parting. May your return meet merrit, and meet with the Gratefull acknowledgments of every well wisher to their Country. Your task is difficult and important. Heaven direct and prosper you. I find from Mr. A--r of B--r that the chief justice is determined to take his Seat, and that the court shall proceed to Buisness if posible, even tho the Sheriff should be obliged to return no other but the late addressers. He talks as he always used to-sometimes one  thing sometimes an other, pretends the money would not have been collected in that town for the congress if he had not exerted himself, tho it seems he staid till the eleventh hour, and it did not get to town before you left it. I found by a hint he dropd that he used all his influence to surpress the Nonconsumption agreement which some of them had drawn up to sign, and that he has inlisted himself intirely under the influence of the ch[ie]f J[ustic]e. He also expresses great Bitterness against C[olone]l W[arre]n of P[lymout]h for encourageing young Morton to setle there & seems gratified with the thought of his loosing his place, &c -- So much for politicks -- now for our own Domestick affairs. Mr. Rice came this afternoon. and He and Mr. Thaxter are setled over at the office. Crosby has given up the School, and as it is to move to the other parish Mr. Rice cannot have it. I must therefore agree with them to take the care of John, and school him with them, which

 will perhaps be better for him than going to the Town School. I shall reckon over every week as they pass, and rejoice at every Saturday evening. I hope to hear from you by Mr. Cunningham when he returns tho I know not when that will be but he was so kind as to send me word that he was going and would take a letter for me. Our little ones send their Duty to their Pappa, and the Gentlemen their respects-and that which at all times and in all places evermore attends you is the  most affectionate regard of your "

","The great distance between us, makes the time appear very long to me. It seems already a month since you left me. The great anxiety I feel for my Country, for you and for our family renders the day tedious, and the night . The Rocks and quick Sands appear upon every Side. What course you can or will take is all wrapt in the Bosom of futurity. Uncertainty and expectation leave the mind great Scope. Did ever any Kingdom or State regain their Liberty, when once it was invaded without Blood shed? I cannot think of it without horror. Yet we are told that all the Misfortunes of Sparta were  by their too greatSollisitude Sollicitude for present tranquility, and by an excessive love of peace they neglected the means of making it sure and lasting. They ought to have reflected says Polibius that as there is nothing more desirable, or advantages than peace, when founded in justice and honour, so there is nothing more shameful and at the same time more pernicious when attained by bad measures, and purchased at the price of liberty. I have received a most charming Letter from our Friend Mrs. W--n . She desires  me to tell you that her best wishes attend you thro your journey both as a Friend and patriot -- hopes you will have no uncommon difficulties to surmount or Hostile Movements to impeade you-but if the Locrians should interrupt you, she hopes you will beware that no future Annals may say you chose an ambitious Philip for your Leader, who subverted the noble order of the American Amphyctions, and built up a Monarchy on the Ruins of the happy institution. I have taken a very great fondness for reading Rollin's ancient History since you left me. I am determined to go  with it if posible in these my days of solitude. I find great pleasure and entertainment from it, and I have perswaided Johnny to read me a page or two every day, and hope he will from his desire to oblige me entertain a fondness for it.-- We have had a charming rain which lasted 12 hours and has greatly revived the dying fruits of the earth. I want much to hear from you. I long impatiently to have you upon the Stage of action. The first of September or the month of September, perhaps may be of as much  importance to Great Britan as the Ides of March were to Ceaser. I wish you every Publick as well, as private blessing, and that wisdom which is profitable both for instruction and edification to conduct you in this difficult day.-The little flock remember Pappa, and kindly wish to see him.

","I am very impatient to receive a letter from you. You indulged me so much in that Way in your last absence, that I now think I have a right to hear as often from you as you have leisure and opportunity to write. I hear that Mr. Adams wrote to his Son and the Speaker to his Lady, but perhaps you did not know of the opportunity. Suppose you have before this time received two letters from me, and will write me by the same conveyance. I judg you  Phylidelphia last Saturday night. I cannot but felicitate you upon your absence a little while from this Scene of purtubation, anxiety and distress. I own I feel not a little agitated with the accounts I have this day received from Town. Great commotions have arisen in concequence of the discovery of a Tratorous plot of Colonel Brattl''s-his advice to Gage to Break every commisiond officer, and to seize the province  [illegible]   and Towns Stock of powder. This has so enraged and exasperated the people that there is great apprehension of an immediate rupture. They have been all in flames ever since the new fangled counsellors have taken their oaths. The importance with which they consider the meeting of the Congress, and the result thereof to the community, withholds the arm of vengance already lifted but which would most certainly fall with accumalated wrath upon Brattle were it posible to come at him, but no sooner did he discover that his treachery had taken air, than he fled not only to Boston, but into the camp for Safety. You will by Mr. Tudor no doubt have a much more accurate account than I am able to give you, but one thing I can inform you of which perhaps you may not have heard, viz. Mr. Vinton our Sheriff it seems received one of those twenty Warrants which were issued by Mr. Goldthwait (and Price, and which has Cost them such bitter repentance, and Humble acknowledgments, and which has reveald the great Secret of their attachment to the liberties of their country and their veneration and regard, for the good will of their countrymen. See their address to H[utchinso]n and G[ag]e). This Warrent which was for Stotingham Vinton carried and deliverd to a Constable there, but before he had got 6 mile he was overtaken by 60 men on horseback who surrounded him  and told him unless he returnd with them, and demanded back that Warrent and committed it to the flames before their faces, he must take the concequences of a refusal, and he not thinking it best to endure their vengance returnd with them, made his demand of the Warrent and consumed it, upon which they disperced and left him to his own reflections. Since the News of the Quebec bill arrived all the church people here have hung their heads and will not converse upon politicks,tho ever so much provoked by the opposite party. Before that parties run very high, and very hard words, and threats of blows, upon both sides were given out. They have had their Town meeting here andwhich was full as usual, chose their committee for the County meeting, and did Buisness without once regarding or fearing for the concequences. I should be glad to know how you found the people as you traveled from town to town. I hear you met with great Hospitality and kindness in Connecticut. Pray let me know how your Health is, and whether you have not had exceeding hot weather. The drought has been very severe. My poor Cows will certainly prefer a petition to you, setting forth their  Greavences and informing you that they have been deprived of their ancient privilages, whereby they are become great Sufferers, and desiring that they may be restored to them, more espicially as their living by reason of the drought is all taken from them, and their property which they hold else where is all decaying. They Humbly pray that you would consider them least hunger should break thro the Stone walls. Our little flock are well, and present their Duty to their Pappa. My Mother is in a very low State occasiond by a return of her old complaints. Nabby has enclosed a letter to you-would be glad I would excuse the writing, because of a soar Thumb, which she has.  The tenderest regard evermore awaits you from your Most Affectionate   "

","Dearest Friend Five Weeks have past and not one line have I received. I had rather give a dollar for a letter by the post,  the consequence should be that I Eat but one meal for these 3 a day for these 3 weeks to come. Every one I see is inquiring after you and when did I hear. All my intelligance is collected from the news paper and I can only reply that I saw by that, that you arrived such a day. I know your fondness for writing and your inclination to let me hear from you by the first safe conveyance which makes me suspect that some Letter or other has miscaried, but I hope now you have arrived at Philidelphia you will find means to convey me some inteligance. We are all well here. I think I enjoy better Health than I have done these 2 years. I have not been to Town since I parted with you there. The Govenor is making all kinds of warlike preperations such as mounting cannon upon Beacon Hill, diging entrenchments upon the Neck, placeing cannon there, encamping a regiment there, throwing up Brest Works &c. &c. The people are much , and the Selectmen have waited upon him in concequence of it. The county congress have also sent a committee-all which proceedings you will have a  [illegible]   more particuliar account of than I am able to give you from the publick papers. But as to the Movements of this Town perhaps you may not hear them from any other person. In consequence of the powders being taken from Charlstown, a general alarm spread thro many Towns and was caught pretty soon here. The report took here a fryday, and a Sunday a Soldier was seen lurking about the common. Supposed to be a Spy, but most likely a Deserter. However inteligence of it was communicated to the other parishes, and about 8 o clock a Sunday Evening there pass[ed] by here about 200 Men, preceeded by a horse cart, and marched down to the powder house from whence they took the powder and carried [it] into the other parish and there secreeted it. I opened the window upon there return. They  without any Noise, not a word among them till they came against this house, when some of them perceiveing me, askd me if I wanted any powder. I replied not since it was in so good hands.  The reason they gave for taking it, was that we had so many Tories here they dare not trust us with it. They had taken Vinton in their Train, and upon their return they stoped between Cleverlys and Etters, and calld upon him to deliver two Warrents. Upon his producing them, they put it to vote whether they should burn them and it pass'd in the aflirmitive. They then made a circle and burnt them, they then call'd a vote whether they should huzza, but it being Sunday evening it passd in the negative. They call'd upon Vinton to swear that he would never be instrumental in carrying into execution any of these new atcts. They were not satisfied with his answers however they let him rest. A few Days after upon his making some foolish speaches, they assembled to the amount of a and [3?] hundred, swore vengance upon him unless he took a solemn oath. Accordingly, they chose a committee and sent [them] with him to Major Miller to see that he complied, and they waited his return, which proving satisfactory they disperced. This Town appear as high as you can well immagine, and if necessary would soon be in arms. Not a Tory but hides his head. The church parson thought they were comeing after him, and run up garret they say, an other jumpt out of his window and hid among the corn whilst a third crept under his bord fence, and told his Beads. I Dined  at Coll. Quincys. They were so kind as to send me, and Nabby and Betsy an invitation to spend the Day with them, and as I had not been to see them since I removed to Braintree, I accepted the invitation. After I got there, came Mr. Samll. Quincys wife and Mr. Sumner, Mr. Josiah and Wife. A little clashing of parties you may be sure. Mr. Sam's Wife said she thought it high time for her Husband to turn about, he had not done half so clever since he left her advice. Said they both greatly admired the most excellent and much admired Speach of the Bishop of St. Asaph which suppose you have seen. It meets, and most certainly merrits the greatest encomiums. Upon my return at night Mr. Thaxter met me at the door with your Letter dated from Prince town New Jersy. It really gave me such a flow of Spirits that I was not composed eno to sleep till one oclock. You make no mention of one I wrote you previous to that you received by Mr. Breck and sent by Mr. Cunningham. I hope or I am rejoiced to hear you are  well; I want to know many more perticuliars than you wrote me, and hope soon to hear from you again. I dare not trust myself with the thought of how long you may  [illegible]   perhaps be absent. I only count the weeks already past, and they amount to 5. I am not so lonely as I should have been, without my two Neighbours. We make a table full at meal times, all the rest of their time they spend in the office. Never were two borders persons who gave a family less trouble than they do. It is at last determined that Mr. Rice keep the School here. Indeed he has kept ever since he has been here, but not with any expectation that He should be continued, but the people finding no small difference between him and his predecessor chose he should be continued. I have not sent Johnny. He goes very steadily to Mr. Thaxter who I believe takes very good care of him, and as they seem to have a likeing to each other believe it will be best to continue him with him. However when you return we can then consult what will be best. I am certain that if he does not get so much good, he gets less harm, and I have always thought it  [illegible]   of very great importance that children should in the early part of life be unaccustomed to such examples as would tend to corrupt the purity of their words and actions that they may chill with horrour at the sound of an oath, and blush with indignation at an obscene expression. These first principal[s] which grow with their growth and strengthen with their strength neither time nor custom can totally eradicate.-You will perhaps be tired. No let it serve by way of relaxation from the more important concerns of the Day, and be such an amusement as your little hermitage used to afford you here. You have before you to express myself in the words of the Bishop the greatest National concerns that ever came before any people, and if the prayers and peti[ti]ons assend unto Heaven which are daily offerd for you, wisdom will flow down as a streem and Rithousness as the mighty waters, and your deliberations will make glad the cities of our God. I was very sorry I did not know of Mr. Cary's going. It would have been so good an opportunity to have sent this as I lament the loss of. You have heard no doubt of  the peoples preventing the court from setting in various counties, and last week in Taunton, Anger [Angier] urged the courts opening, and calling out the action, but could not effect it. I saw a Letter from Miss Eunice wherein she gives an account of it, and says there were 2000  men assembled round the court house and by a committee of nine presented a petition requesting that they would not set, and with the uttmost order waited 2 hours for there answer, when they disperced. Your family all desire to be remember'd to you, as well as  Quincy who often visits me, to have an hour of sweet communion upon politicks with me. Coll. Quincy desires his complements to you. Dr. Tufts sends his Love and your Mother and Brothers also. I have lived a very recluse life since your absence, seldom going any where except to my Fathers who with My Mother and Sister desire to be rememberd to you. My Mother has been exceeding low, but is a little better. How warm your climate may be I know not, but I have had my bed warmed these two nights.-I must request you to procure me some watermellon seads and Muskmellon, as I determine to be well stocked with them an other year. We have had some fine rains, but as soon as the corn is gatherd you must release me of my promise. The Drougth has renderd cutting a second crop impracticable, feeding a little cannot hurt it. However I hope you will be at home to be convinced of the utility of the measure.-You will burn all these Letters least they should fall from your pocket and thus expose  your most affectionate Friend, "

","I have just  from a visit to my Brother, with my Father who carried me there the day before yesterday, and call'd here in my return to see this much injured Town. I view it with much the same sensations that I should the body of a departed Friend, only put of[f] its present Glory, for to rise finally to a more happy State. I will not despair, but will believe that our cause being good we shall finally prevail. The Maxim in time of peace prepair for war, (if this may be call'd a time of peace) resounds throughout the Country. Next tuesday they are warned at Braintree all above 15 and under 60 to attend with their arms, and to train once a fortnight from that time, is a Scheme which lays much at heart with many. Scot has arrived, and brings news that he expected to find all peace and Quietness here as he left them at home. You will have more particuliars than I am able to send you, from much better hands. There has been in Town a conspiracy of the Negroes. At present it is kept pretty private and was  by one who endeavourd to diswaid them from it-he being threatned with his life, applied to justice Quincy for protection. They conducted in this way-got an Irishman to draw up a petition letting to the Govener telling him they would fight for him provided he would arm them and engage to liberate them if he conquerd, and it is said that he attended so much to it as to consult Pircy upon it, and one [Lieut.?] Small has been very buisy and active. There is but little said, and what Steps they will take in consequence of it I know not. I wish most sincerely there was not a Slave in the province. It allways appeard a most iniquitious Scheme to me-fight ourselfs for what we are daily robbing and plundering from those who have as good a right to freedom as we have. You know my mind upon this Subject. I left all our little ones well, and shall return  to them to night. I hope to hear from you by the return of the bearer of this and by Revere. I long for the Day of your return, yet look upon you much safer where you are, but know it will not do for you. Not one action has been brought to this court, no buisness of any sort in your way. All law ceases, and the Gosple will soon follow, for they are supporters of each other. Adieu. My Father hurries me.  Yours most sincerely, "
"Braintree  October 16 1774
","My Much Loved Friend I dare not express to you at 300 hundred miles distance how ardently I long for your return. I have some very miserly Wishes; and cannot consent to your spending one hour in Town till at least I have had you 12. The Idea plays about my Heart, unnerves my hand whilst I write, awakens all the tender sentiments that years have  and matured, and which when with me was were every day dispensing to you. The whole collected stock of nine ten weeks  [illegible]  absence knows not haw to brook any longer restraint, but will break forth and flow thou my pen. May the like sensations enter thy breast, and (in spite of all the weighty cares of State) Mingle themselves with those I wish to com municate, for in giving them utterance I have felt more sincere pleasure than I have known since the 10 of August. Many have been the anxious hours I have spent since that day-the threatening aspect of our publick affairs, the complicated distress of this province, the Arduous and perplexed Buisness in which you are engaged, have all conspired to agitate my bosom, with fears and apprehensions to which I have heretofore been [a] stranger, and far from thinking the Scene closed,  [illegible]   it looks [as] tho the curtain was but just drawn and only the first Scene of the infernal plot disclosed and whether the end will be tragical Heaven alone knows. You cannot be, I know, nor do I wish to see you an inactive Spectator, but if the Sword be drawn I bid adieu to all domestick felicity, and look forward to that Country where there is neither wars nor rumors of War in a firm belief that thro the mercy of its King we shall both rejoice there together. I greatly fear that the arm of treachery and voilence are is lifted over us as a Scourge and heavy punishment from heaven for our numerous offences, and for the misimprovement of our great advantages. If we expect the blessings to inherit the blessings of our Fathers, we should return a little more to their primitive Simplicity of Manners, and not sink into inglorious ease. We have too many high sounding words, and too few, actions that correspond with them. I have spent one Sabbeth in Town since you left me. I saw no difference in respect to ornamen ornaments, &c. &c. but in the Country you must look for that virtue, of which you find but small Glimerings in the  Metropolis. Indeed they have not the advantages, nor the resolution to encourage our own Manufactories which people in the country have. To the Mercantile part, tis considerd as throwing away their own Bread; but they must retrench their expenses and be content with a small share of gain for they will find but few who will wear their Livery.  [illegible]   As for me I will seek wool and flax and work willingly with my Hands, and indeed their is occasion for all our industry and economy. You mention the removal of our Books &c. from Boston. I believe they are safe there, and it would incommode the Gentlemen to remove them, as they would not then have a place to repair to for study. I suppose they would not chose to be at the expense of bording out. Mr. Williams I believe keeps pretty much with his mother. Mr. Hills father had some thoughts of removing up to Braintree provided he could be accommodated with a house, which he finds very difficult. Mr. Cranch's last determination was to tarry in Town unless any thing new takes place. His Friends in Town oppose his Removal so much that he is determind to stay. The opinion you have  of General Gage is I believe just, indeed he professes to act only upon the Defensive. The People in the  [Country] begin to be very anxious for the congress to rise. They have no Idea of the Weighty Buisness you have to transact, and their Blood boils with indignation at the Hostile prepairations they are constant Witnesses of. Mr. Quincys so secret departure is Matter of various Specculation-some say he is deputed by the congress, others that he is gone to Holland, and the Tories says he is gone to be hanged. I rejoice at the  account you give me of your Health; May it be continued to you. My Health is much better than it was last fall. Some folks say I grow very fat.-I venture to write most any thing in this Letter, because I know the care of the Bearer. He will be mast sadly dissapointed if you should be broke up before he arrives, as he is very desirous of being introduced by you to a Number of Gentlemen of respectable characters. I almost envy him, that be should see you, before I can. Mr. Thaxter and Rice present their Regards to you. Unkle Quinsy too sends his Love to you, he is very good to call and see me, and so have all many other of my Friends been. Coll. Waxen and Lady were here a monday, and send their Love to you. The Coll. promiss'd to write. Mrs. Waxen will spend a Day or two on her return with me. I told Betsy to write to you. She says she would if you were her Husband. Your Mother sends her Love to you, and all your family too numerous to name desire to be . You will receive Letters from two, who are as earnest to write to Pappa as if the welfare of a kingdom depended upon it. If you can give any guess within a month let me know when you think of returning to  Your most Affectionate "

","I have but little news to write you.  of that kind you will learn by a more accurate hand than mine; things remain much in the same situation here that they were when you went away, there has been no Desent upon the sea coast. Guards are regularily kept, and people seem more settled, and are returning to their husbandry. -- I feel somewhat lonesome. Mr. Thaxter is gone home, Mr. Rice is going into the Army as captain of a company. We have no School. I know not what to do with John. -- As Goverment is assumed I suppose Courts of justice will be established, and in that case there may be Buisness to do. If so would it not be best for Mr. Thaxter to return? They seem to be discouraged in the study of Law, and think there never will be any buisness for them. I could have wishd they had consulted you upon the subject before you went away. Mr. Rice has asked my advice? I tell him I would have him act his pleasure. I dont chuse to advise him either way. -- I suppose you will receive 2 or 3 Vol. of that forlorn Wretches Hutchisons Letters. Among many other things I hear he wrote in 1772 that Deacon Philips and you had like  to have been chosen into the Counsel, but if you had you should have shared the same fate of with Bowers. May the fate of Mordeca be his. -- There is no body admitted into Town yet. I have made two or 3 attempts to get somebody in, but cannot succeed, so have not been able to do the Buisness you left in charge with me. -- I want very much to hear from you, how you stood your journey, and in what state you find yourself now. I felt very anxious about you tho I endeavourd to be very insensible and heroick, yet my heart felt like a heart of Led. The same Night you left me I heard of Mr. Quincys Death, which at this time was  [illegible]   [illegible]   a most melancholy Event, especially as he wrote in minets which he left behind that he had matters of concequence intrusted with him, which for want of a confident must die with him. -- I went to see his distressed widdow last Saturday at the Coll. and in the afternoon from an allarm they had, she and her sister, with three others of the family took refuge with me, and tarried all night. She desired me to present her regards to you, and let you know she wished you every blessing, should always esteem you as the a a sincere Friend of her

 deceased husband. Poor afflicted woman, my heart was wounded for her. -- I must quite the subject, and intreet you to write me by every opportunity. Your Mother desires to be rememberd to you. She is with me now. The children send Duty, and their Mamma unfeigned Love.  "

","I received by the  two Letters from you this Day from  Hartford. I feel a recruit of spirits upon the reception of them, and the comfortable news which they contain. We had not heard any thing from  N. Carolina before, and could not help feeling anxious least we should find a defection there, arising more from their ancient feuds and animosities, than from any setled ill will in the present contest. But the confirmation of the choise of their Delagates by their assembly leaves not a doubt of their firmness, nor doth the Eye say unto the hand I have no need of thee, the Lord will not cast of his people neither will he forsake his inheritance. Great Events are most certainly in the womb of futurity and if the present chastisement which we experience have a proper influence upon our conduct, the Event will most certainly be in our favour. -- The Distresses of the inhabitants of  Boston are beyond the power of language to discribe. There are but very few who are permitted to come out in a day. They delay giving passes, make them wait from hour to hour, and their counsels are not two hours together alike. One day they shall come out with their Effects, the next Day merchandise are not Effects. One day their household furtinuture is to come out, the next only weareing apparrel, and the next Pharaohs heart is hardned, and he refuseth  to hearken unto them and will not let the people go. May their deliverence be wrought out for them as it was for the Children of  Israel. I do not mean by miracles by [illegible]   but by the interposition of heaven in their favour. They have taken a list of all those who they suppose were concernd in watching the tea, and every other person who they call obnoxious, and they and their Effects are to suffer distruction. Poor EddsEads escaped out of town last night with one Ayers in a small boat, and was fired upon, but got safe and came up to  Braintree to day. His name it seems was upon the black list. -- I find it impossible to get any body in with any surty of their returning again. I have sent to Walthham but cannot hear any thing of Mr. Cushings Son. I wish you would write me whether Mr. Cushing left any directions what should be done in that affair. -- I hear that Mr. Bromfield has Letters for you, and young Dr. Jarvis has more, but cannot get at them. -- Pray write me every opportunity every thing that transpires. Every body desires to be rememberd to you -- it would fill the paper to name them. I wrote you once before. Let me know whether you have received it. -- You dont say one word about your Health.

","Suppose you have had a formidable account of the alarm we had last Sunday morning. When I rose about six oclock I was told that the Drums had been some time beating and that 3  Guns were fired, that  Weymouth Bell had been ringing, and Mr. Welds was then ringing. I immediatly sent of an express to know the occasion, and found the whole Town in confusion. 3 Sloops and one cutter had come out, and droped anchor just below Great Hill. It was difficult to tell their design, some supposed they were comeing to  Germantown others to  Weymouth. People women children from the Iron Works flocking down this Way -- every woman and child above or from below my Fathers. My Fathers family flying, the Drs. in great distress, as you may well immagine for my Aunt had her Bed thrown into a cart, into which she got herself, and orderd the boy to drive her of to  Bridgwater which he did. The report was to them, that 300 hundred had landed, and were upon their march into Town. The allarm flew  [like] lightning, and men from all parts came flocking down till 2000 were collected -- but it seems their expidition was to  Grape Island for Levet's hay. There it was impossible to reach them for want of Boats, but the sight of so many persons, and the fireing at them prevented their getting more than 3 ton of Hay, tho they had carted much more down to the water. At last they musterd a Lighter, and a Sloop from  Hingham which had six port holes. Our men eagerly jumpt on board, and put of for the  Island. As soon as they perceived it, they decamped. Our people landed upon   [the] Island, and in an instant set fire to the Hay which with the Barn was soon consumed, about 80 ton tis said. We expect soon to be in continual alarms, till something decisive takes place. We wait with longing Expectation in hopes to hear the best accounts from you with regard to union and harmony &c. We rejoice greatly on the Arival of Doctor Franklin, as he must certainly be able to inform you very perticuliarly of the situation of affairs in  England. I wish you would  [write] if you can get time; be as perticuliar as you may, when you write -- every one here abouts  to me to hear what accounts I have. I was so unlucky as not to get the Letter you wrote at  New York. Capn. Beals forgot it, and left it behind. We have a flying report here with regard to  New York, but cannot give any credit to, as yet, that they had been engaged with the Ships which Gage sent there and taken them with great looss upon both sides. Yesterday we have an account of 3 Ships  in to  Boston. I believe it is true, as there was a Salute from the other Ships, tho I have not been able to learn from whence they come. Suppose you have had an account of the fire which did much damage to the Warehouses, and added greatly to the distresses of the inhabitants whilst it continued. The bad conduct of General Gage was the means of its doing so much damage. Tis a fine growing Season having lately had a charming rain, which was much wanted as  we had none before for a fortnight. Your meadow is almost fit to mow.Isaac talks of leaving you, and going into the Army. I believe he will. Mr. Rice has a prospect of an adjutant place in the Army. I believe he will not be a very hardy Soldier. He has been sick of a fever above this week, and has not been out of his chamber. He is upon the recovery now. Our House has been upon this alarm in the same Scene of confusion that it was upon the first -- Soldiers  in for lodging, for Breakfast, for Supper, for Drink &c. &c. Sometimes refugees from  Boston tierd and fatigued, seek an assilum for a Day or Night, a week -- you can hardly imagine how we live. I want to know how you do? How are your Eyes? Is not the weather very hot where you are? The children are well and send Duty to Pappa. This day Month you set of. I have never once inquired when you think it  to return; as I think you could not give me any satisfactory answer. I have according to your direction wrote to Mr. Dilly, and given it to the care of Calm. Beals who will deliver it with his own hand; I got Mr. Thaxter to take a coppy for me, as I had not time amidst our confusions; I send it to you for your approbation. You -- will be careful of it as I   have no other coppy. My best wishes attend you both for your Health and happiness, and that you may be directed into the wisest and best measures for our Safety, and the Security of our posterity. I wish you was nearer to us. We know not what a day will bring forth, nor what distress one hour may throw us into. Heitherto I have been able to mantain a calmness and presence of Mind, and hope I shall, let the Exigency of the time be what they will. Mrs.  desires to be rememberd to you with her sincere regards. Mr. [Cranch] and family send their Love. He poor man has a fit of his old disorder. I have not heard one Syllable from  Providence since I wrote you last. I wait to hear from you, then shall act accordingly. I dare not discharge any debts with what I have except to Isaac, least you should be dissapointed of the remainder.  Adieu Breakfast calls your affectionate Sister  is with me, and desires her kindest Wishes, and most affectionate Regards may be presented to you. "

","I set down to write to you a monday, but really could not compose  sufficently: the anxiety I sufferd from not hearing one syllable from you for more than five weeks; and the new distress ariseing from the arrival of recruits agitated me more than I have been since the never to be forgotten 14 of April. I have been much revived by receiving two letters from you last Night, one by the servant of your Friend and the other by the Gentleman you mention,  they both went to  Cambridge, and I have not seen them. I hope to send this as a return to you. I  much for your Health when you went away. I must intreat you to be as careful as you can consistant with the Duty you owe your Country. That consideration alone prevaild with me to consent to your departure, in a time so perilous and so hazardous to your family, and with a body so infirm as to require the tenderest care and nursing. I wish you may be supported and devinely assisted in this most important crisis when the fate of Empires depend upon your wisdom and conduct. I greatly rejoice to hear of your union, and determination to stand by us. We cannot but consider the great distance you are from us as a very great misfortune, when our critical situation renders it necessary to hear from you every week, and will be more and more so, as difficulties arise. We now expect our Sea coasts ravaged. Perhaps, the very next Letter I write will inform you that I am driven away from our, yet quiet cottage. Necessity will oblige  to take some desperate steps. We are told for Truth, that he is now Eight thousand strong. We live in continual expectation of allarms. Courage I know we have in abundance, conduct I hope we shall not want, but powder -- where shall we get a sufficient supply? I wish we may not fail there. Every Town is fill'd with the distressd inhabitants of  Boston -- our House among others is deserted, and by this time like enough made use of as a Barack Barrack. -- Mr. Bowdoin with his Lady, are at present in the house of Mrs. Borland, and are a going to  Middlebouragh to the house of judge Oliver. He poor Gentleman is so low, that I apprehend he is hastening to an house not made with Hands -- looks like a mere skelliton, speaks faint and low, is racked with a voilent cough, and I think far advanced in a consumption. I went to see him last Saturday. He is very inquisitive of every person with  regard to the times, beged I would let him know of the first inteligence I had from you, is very unable to converse by reason of his cough. He rides every pleasent Day, and has been kind enough to call upon at the Door, ( tho unable to get out) several times. Says the very name of Hutchinson distresses him. Speaking of him the other day he broke out, ""religious Rascal, how I abhor his Name."" We have had very dry weather not a rainy day since you left us. The english Grass will not  half so great a crop as last year. Fruit promisses well, but the Cattell Cattepillars have been innumerable. I wrote you with regard to the money I had got from  Providence. I have since that  the rest. I have done as you directed with regard to the payment of some you mentiond, but it incroachd some upon your Stock. You will write me with regard to what you have necessity for and how I shall convey to you. -- Mr. Rice is dissapointed of his place in the Army but has hopes of joining a company much talked of here under Mr. Hancock when he returns. I came here with some of my cousin Kents who came to see me a day, or two ago, and have left company to write you this afternoon least I should fail of conveyance. Pray be perticuliar when you write as possible -- every body wants to hear, and to know what is doing, and what may be communicated, do not fail to inform me. All our Friends desire to be kindly rememberd to you. Gage'es proclamation you will receive by this conveyance. All the records of time cannot produce a blacker page. Satan when driven from the regions of bliss, Exibeted not more malice. Surely the father of lies is superceded. -- Yet we think it the best proclamation he could have issued. I shall when ever I can, receive and entertain in the best Manner I am capable the Gentlemen who have so generously proferd their Service in our Army.  is wanted in the army, and Else where. We see the want of it more from so large a body being together, than when each individual was imployd in his own domestick circle.My best regards attend every Man you esteem. You will make my complements  to Mr. Miflin and Lady. I do not now wonder at the regard the regard the Laidies express for a Soldier -- every man who wears a cockade appears of double the importance he used to, and I feel a respect for the lowest Subaltern in the Army. -- You tell me you know dot when you shall see me. I never trust myself long with the terrors which sometimes intrude themselves upon me. I hope we shall see each other again and rejoice together in happier Days. The little ones are well, and send Duty to Pappa. Dont fail of letting me hear from you by every opportunity, every line is like a precious  of the Saints. Pray dont Expose me by a communication of any of my Letters -- a very bad Soar upon the middle finger of my right hand has prevented my writing for 3 weeks. This is the 5 Letter I have wrote you. I hope they have all come to hand. -- I have a request to make you. Something like the Barrel of Sand suppose you will think it, but really of much more importance to me. It is that you would send out Mr. Bass and purchase me a bundle of pins and put in your trunk for me. The cry for pins is so great that what we used to Buy for 7.6 are now 20 Shillings and not to be had for that. A bundle contains 6 thousand for which I used to give a Dollor, but if you can procure them for 50  [shillings] or 3 pound, pray let me have them. Mr. Welch who carries this to head Quarters waits which prevents my adding more than that I am with the tenderest Regard  "
Sunday June 18 1775,"Dearest Friend The Day; perhaps the decisive Day is come on which the fate of  America depends. My bursting Heart must find vent at my pen. I have just heard that our dear Friend Dr. Warren is no more but fell gloriously fighting for his Country -- saying better to die  in the field than ignominiously hang upon the Gallows. Great is our Loss. He has distinguished himself in every engagement, by his courage and fortitude, by animating the Soldiers and leading them on by his own example. A particuliar account of these dreadful, but I hope Glorious Days will be transmitted you, no doubt in the exactest manner. The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, but the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Trust in him at all times, ye people pour out your hearts before him. God is a refuge for us. --   is laid in ashes. The Battle began upon our intrenchments upon  Bunkers Hill, a Saturday morning about 3 o clock and has not ceased yet and tis now  [illegible]  3 o'clock Sabbeth afternoon. Tis expected they will come out over the Neck to night, and a dreadful Battle must ensue. Almighty God cover the heads of our Country men, and be a shield to our Dear Friends. How  fallen we know not -- the constant roar of the cannon is so  [illegible]   [distressing] that we can not Eat, Drink or Sleep. May we be supported and sustaind in the dreadful conflict. I shall tarry here till tis thought unsafe by my Friends, and then I have secured myself a retreat at your Brothers who has kindly offerd me part of his house. I cannot compose myself to write any further at present. I will add more as I hear further. I have been so much agitated that I have not been able to write since  day. When I say that ten thousand reports are passing vague and uncertain as the wind I believe I speak the Truth. I am not able to give you any authentick account of last Saturday, but you will not be destitute of inteligence. Coll. Palmer has just sent me word that he has an opportunity of conveyance. Incorrect as this scrawl will be, it shall go. I wrote you last Saturday morning. In the afternoon I received your kind favour of the 2 june, and that you sent me by Captn. Beals at the same time. -- I ardently pray that you may be supported thro the arduous task you have before you. I wish I could contradict the report of the Doctors Death, but tis a lamentable Truth, and the tears of multitudes pay tribute to his memory. Those favorite lines  [of ]Collin continually sound in my Ears  How sleep the Brave who sink to rest, By all their Countrys wishes blest? When Spring with dew'ey fingers cold Returns to deck their Hallowed mould
 She their shall dress a sweeter Sod Than fancys feet has ever trod. By fairy hands their knell is rung By forms unseen their Dirge is sung 
 [There] Honour comes a pilgrim grey To Bless the turf that wraps their Clay And freedom shall a while repair To Dwell a weeping Hermit there.
 I rejoice in the prospect of the plenty you inform me of, but cannot say we have the same  veiw here. The drought is very severe, and things look but poorly. Mr. Rice and Thaxter,  Quincy, Col. Quincy,Mr. Wibert all desire to be rememberd, so do all the rest of our the family. Nabby will write by the next conveyance. I must close, as the Deacon . I have not pretended to be perticuliar with regard to what I have heard, because I know you will collect better intelligence. The Spirits of the people are very good. The loss of  Charlstown affects them no more than a Drop in the Bucket. --  I am Most sincerely yours,  "
"June 22, 1775","I received yours  june 10 , for which I thank you. I want you to be more perticuliar. Does every Member feel for us? Can they realize what we suffer? And can they believe with what patience and fortitude we endure the conflict -- nor do we even tremble at the frowns of power. -- You inquire of me, who were at the engagement at  Grape Island. I may say with truth all  Weymouth Braintree  Hingham who were able to bear Arms, and hundreds from other Towns within 20 30 and 40 miles of  Weymouth. Our good Friend the Doctor is in a very misirable state of Health, has the jaundice to a  [very great] degree, is a mere Skelliton and hardly able to  [ride from] his own house to my fathers. Danger you  [know] sometimes makes timid men bold. He stood that day very .well, and generously attended with drink, Bisquit, flints &c. 5 hundred men without taking any pay. He has since been chosen one of the committee of Correspondence for that Town, and has done much Service by establishing a regular method of alarm from Town to Town. Both your Brothers were there -- your younger Brother with his company who gaind honour by their good order that Day. He was one of the first to venture aboard a Schooner to land upon the Island. -- At  Chelsa I cannot be so perticuliar as I do not know only in General, that Coll. Putnam commanded there, and had many Gentlemen volunters. We have two companies stationd in this Town, at  Germantown Captn. Turner, at  Squantom Capt. Vinton. In  Weymouth one, in  Hingham two &c. -- I believe I shall remove your Books this week to your Brothers. We think it adviseable. Coll. Quincy has procured his family a retreat at Deacon Holebrooks. Mr. Cranch has one at Major Basses -- in case of necessity to which we hope not to be driven. -- We hear that the troops destined for  Newyork are all expected here, but we have got to that pass that a whole legion of them would not intimidate us. -- I think I am very brave upon the whole. If danger comes near my dwelling I suppose I shall shuder. We want powder  [although] with the blessing of Heaven we fear them not ... every possible method that can be made use of  [ . . . ]  it should, be by the whole continent. The state we are in at present is intrenching and fortifying. Tis said we have lost 44 men and the Regulars near a thousand, 64 officers amongst them. -- God bless and preserve us. Write me every opportunity you can.  I am your  "

","Dearest Friend My Father has been more affected with the  of  Charlstown, than with any thing which has heretofore taken place. Why should not his countanance be sad when the city, the place of his Fathers Sepulchers lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire, scarcly one stone remaineth upon an other. But in the midst of sorrow we have abundant cause of thankfulness that so few of our Breathren are numberd with the slain, whilst our enimies were cut down like the Grass before the Sythe. But one officer of all the Welch fuzelers remains to tell his story. Many poor wretches dye for want of proper assistance and care of their wounds. Every account agrees in 14 and 15 hundred slain and wounded upon their side nor can I learn that they dissemble the number themselves. We had some Heroes that day who fought with amazing intrepidity, and courage -- I hear that  should say the Battle upon the plains of Abram was but a Bauble to this. When we consider all the circumstances attending this action we stand astonished that our people were not all cut of. They had but one hundred foot intrenched, the number who were engaged, did not exceed 800, and they  [had] not half amunition enough. The reinforcements not able to get to them seasonably, the tide was up and high, so that their floating batteries came upon each side of the causway and their row gallies playing keeping a continual fire. Added to this the fire from fort hill and from the Ship, the Town in flames all round them and the heat from the flames so intence as scarcely to be borne; the day one of the hottest we have had this season and the wind blowing the smoke in their faces -- only figure to yourself all these circumstances, and then consider that we do not count 60 Men lost. My Heart overflows at the recollection. We live in continual Expectation of Hostilities. Scarcely a day that does not produce some, but like Good Nehemiah having made our prayer with God, and set the people with their Swords, their Spears and their bows we will say unto them, Be not  of them. Remember the Lord who is great and terible, and fight for your Breathren, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your houses. I have just received yours of the 17 of   in 7 days only. Every line from that far Country is precious. You do not tell me how you do, but I will hope better. Alass you little thought what distress we were in the day you wrote. They delight in molesting us upon the Sabbeth. Two Sabbeths we have been in such Alarms that we have had no meeting. This day we have set under our own vine in quietness, have heard Mr. Taft, from psalms. The Lord is good to all and his tender mercies are over all his works. The good man was earnest and pathetick. I could forgive his weakness for the sake of his sincerity -- but I long for a Cooper and an Elliot. I want a person who has feeling and sensibility who can take one up with them him Mr. Rice joins General Heaths regiment  as adjutant. Your Brother is very desirous of being in the army, but your good Mother is really voilent against it. I cannot persuaid nor reason her into a consent. Neither he nor I dare let her know that he is trying for a place. My Brother has a Captains commission, and is stationd at  Cambridge. I thought you had the best of inteligence or I should have taken pains to have been more perticuliar. As to  Boston, there are many persons yet there who would be glad to get out if they could.Mr. Boylstone and Mr. Gill the printer with his family are held upon the black list tis said. Tis certain they watch them so narrowly that they will not let them cannot escape, nor your Brother Swift and family. Mr. Mather got out a day or two before  Charlstown was distroyed, and had lodged his papers and what else he got out at Mr. Carys, but they were all consumed. So were many other peoples, who thought they might trust their little there; till teams could be procured to remove them. The people from the Alms house and work house were sent to the lines last week, to make room for their wounded they say.  Medford people are all removed. Every sea port seems in motion. -- O North! may the Groans and cryes of the injured and oppressed Harrow up thy Soul. We have a prodigious Army, but we lack many accomadations which we need. I hope the apointment of these new Generals will give satisfaction. They must be proof against calumny. In a contest like this continual reports are circulated by our Enimies, and they catch with the unwary and the gaping croud who are ready to listen to the marvellous, without considering into of consequences even tho there best Friends are injured.I have not venturd to inquire one word of you about your return. I do not know whether I ought to wish for it -- it seems as if your sitting together was absolutely necessary whilst every day is big with Events. Mr. Bowdoin called a  and took his leave of me desiring I would present his affectionate regards to you. I have hopes that he will recover -- he has mended a good deal. He wished he could have staid in  Braintree, but his Lady was fearful.  I have often heard that fear makes people loving. I never was so much noticed by some people as I have been since you went out of Town, or rather since the 19 of April. Mr.  family are determined to be sociable. Mr. A  n are quite Friendly. --Nabby Johny Charly Tommy all send duty.Tom says I wish I could see par. You would laugh to see them all run upon the sight of a Letter -- like chickens for a crum, when the Hen clucks. Charls says mar What is it any good news? and who is for us and who against us, is the continual inquiry. -- Brother and Sister Cranch send their Love. He has been very well since he removed, for him, and has full employ in his Buisness.   Quincy calls to hear most every day, and as for the Parson, he determines I shall not make the same complaint I did last time, for he comes every other day. Tis exceeding dry weather. We have not had any rain for a long time. Bracket has mowed the  and over the way, but it will not be a last years crop. -- Pray let me hear from you by every opportunity till I have the joy of once more meeting you.  Yours ever more, P.S. Tell Bass his father and family are well.  "

","I have received a good deal of paper from you; I wish it had been more ; the writing is very scant but I must not grumble. I know your time is not yours, nor mine. Your Labours must be great, and your mouth closed, but all you may communicate I beg you would. There is a pleasure I know not whence it arises nor can I stop now to find it out, but this I say there is a degree of pleasure in being able to tell new's -- especially any which so nearly concerns us as all your proceedings do. I should have been more  but I thought you knew everything that pass'd here. The present state of the inhabitants of  Boston is that of the most abject slaves under the most cruel and despotick of Tyrants. Among many instances I could mention let me relate one. Upon the 17 of june printed hand Bills were pasted up at the corner of streets and up upon houses forbideing any inhabitant to go upon their houses or upon any eminence upon pain of death. The inhabitants dared not to look out of their houses nor bee heard or seen to ask a Question. Our prisoners were brought over to the  long wharff and there laid all night without any care of their wounds or any resting place but the pavements till the next day, when they exchanged it for the jail, since which we hear they are civily treated. Their living cannot be good, as they can have  no fresh provisions. Their Beaf we hear is all gone, and their own wounded men die very fast, so that they have raisd a report that the Bullets were poisond. Fish they cannot have -- they have renderd it so difficult to procure it, and the Admiral is such a villan as to oblige every fishing schooner to pay a Dollor every time they go out. The money that has been paid for passes is incredible. Some have given ten twenty 30 and forty Dollors, to get out with a small proportion of their things. Tis reported and believed that they have taken up a number of persons and committed them to jail -- we know not for what in perticuliar. Master Lovel is confined to the Dungeon, a Son of Mr. Edes is in jail. One Mr. Wendle who married a Hunt, and one Wiburt a ship carpenter is now upon trial for his life. God alone knows to what lengths these wretches will go, and will I hope restrain their malice. I would not have you be  about me. Danger they say makes people valient. Heitherto I have been distress'd, but not soardismayed. I have felt for my Country and her Sons, I have bled with them, and for them. Not all the havock and devastation they have made, has wounded me like the death of Warren. We wanted him in the Senate, we want him in his profession, we want him in the field. We mourn for the citizen, the senator, the  [illegible]   physician and the Warriour. May we have others raised up in his room. I have had a very kind and friendly visit from our dear Friends Col. Warren, Lady and Son. Mrs. Warren spent a week almost with me, and he came and met her here and kept  with me. Suppose she will write to you, tho she says you are in her debt. [illegible]   You scarcely make mention of Dr. Franklin. Surely he must be a valuable member. Pray what is become of your Judas. I see he is not with you upon the list of Delegates? I wish I could come and see you. I never suffer myself to think you are about returning soon. Can it, will it ? May I ask? May I wish for it? When once I expect you the time will crawl till I see you -- but hush -- do you know tis eleven o clock at Night? We have had some very fine rains, since I wrote you last. I hope we shall not now have famine added to war. Grain Grain is what we want here -- meat we may have enough and to . Pray dont let Bass forget my pins. Hardwick has applied to me for Mr. Bass to get him a 100 of needles no. 6 to carry on his stocking weaving. He says they in  Phyladelphia will know the proper needle. We shall very soon have no coffee nor sugar nor pepper here -- but huckle berrys and milk we are not obliged to commerce for. All the good folks here send their regards.  is just gone from here, sends his love. You dont say in the two last Letters I received how you do. I hope I have not felt unwell by sympathy, but I have been very unwell for this week tho better now. I saw a Letter of  [yours] to Col. Palmer by General Washington. I hope I have one too. Good Night with thoughts of  do I close my Eyes; Angels gaurd and protect  [thee], and may a safe return ere long bless thy  "

","Dearest Friend I have met with some abuse and very Ill treatment. I want you for my protector and justifier. In this Day of distress for our  Boston Friends when  does what in them lyes to serve them, your Friend Gorge Trott and family moved up to  Braintree, went in with her two Brothers and families with her Father, but they not thinking themselves so secure as in the further in the Country moved away. After they were gone Mr. Church having took the house and took a number of borders. Mr. Trott had engaged a house near his Friends but being prevented going quite so soon as he designd, and the great distress people were in for houses, the owner had taken in a family and dissapointed Mr. Trott, nor could he procure a house any where, for the more remote from the sea coast  [illegible]   [illegible]   you go the thicker you find the  Boston people. After this dissapointment, he had his Goods without unloading brought back to  Braintree, and he with all his family were obliged to shelter themselves in your Brothers house till he could seek further. You know, from the situation of my Brothers family it was impossible for them to tarry there,Mrs. Trots circumstances requiring more rooms than one. In this extremity he applied to me to see if I would not accommodate him with the next house, every other spot in Town being full. I sent for Mr. Hayden and handsomely asked him, he said he would try, but he took no pains to procure himself a place. There were several in the other parish which were to be let, but my Gentleman did not chuse to go there. Mr. Trot upon account of his Buisness which is in considerable demand wanted to be here. Mr. Trott, finding there was no hopes of his going out said he would go in with him, provided I would let  him have the chamber I improved for a Dairy room and the lower room and chamber over it which Hayden has. I then sent and asked Mr. Hayden to be so kind as to remove his things into the other part of the house and told him he might improve the kitchen and back chamber, the bed room and the Dairy room in which he already had a bed. He would not tell me whether he would or not, but said I was turning him out of Door to oblige  Boston folks, and he could not be stired up, and if you was at home you would not once ask him to go out, but was more of a Gentleman. (You must know that both his Sons are in the army, not but one Days Work has been done by any of them this Spring.) I as mildly as I could represented the distress of Mr. Trot  and the difficulties to which he had been put -- that I looked upon it my Duty to do all in my power to Oblige him -- and that he Hayden would be much better accommodated than hundreds who were turnd out of Town -- and I finally said that Mr. Trott should go in. In this State, Sister Adams got to bed and then there was not a Spot in Brothers house for them to lie down in. I removed my dairy things, and once more requested the old Man to move into the other part of the house, but he positively tells me he will not and all the art of Man shall not stir him, even dares me to put any article out of one room into an other. Says Mr. Trot shall not come in -- he has got possession and he will keep it. What not have a place to entertain his children in when they come to see him. I now write you an account of the matter, and desire you to write to 
Page 3
him and give me orders what course I shall take. I must take Mr. Trott in with me and all his family for the present, till he can look out further or have that house. It would make your heart ake to see what difficulties and distresses the poor  Boston people are driven to. Belcher has two families with him. There are 3 in Veses  [Veasey's] house, 2 in Etters,2 in Mr. Savils, 2 in Jonathan Bass'es and yet that obstinate Wretch will not remove his few things into the other part of that house, but live there paying no rent upon the distresses of others. It would be needless to enumerate all his impudence. Let it suffice to say it moved me so much that I had hard Work to suppress my temper. I want to know whether his things may be removed into the other part of the house, whether he consents or not? Mr. Trott would rejoice to take the whole, but would put up with  rather than be a burden to his Friends. I told the old Man I believed I was doing nothing but what I should be justified in. He says well tis a time of war get him out if I can, but cannon Ball shall not move him. If you think you are able to find 3 houses, for 3 such tenents as you have they must abide where they are, tho I own I shall be much mortified if you do not support me. I feel too angry to make this  further than a Letter of Buisness.  I am most sincerely yours,  "

","Dearest Friend I have this afternoon had the pleasure of receiving your Letter by your Friends Mr. Collins and Kaighn and an English  his Name I do not remember. It was next to seeing my dearest Friend. Mr. Collins could tell me more perticuliarly about you and your Health than I have been able to hear since you left me. I rejoice in his account of your better Health, and of your spirits, tho he says I must not expect to see you till next spring. I hope he does not speak the truth. I know I think I do, for am not I your Bosome Friend? your feelings, your anxieties, your exertions, &c. more than those before whom you are obliged to wear the face of cheerfulness. I have seen your Letters to Col. Palmer and Warren. I pity your . How difficult the task to quench out the fire and the pride of  [illegible]   private ambition, and to sacrifice ourselfs and all our hopes and expectations to the publick weal. How few have souls capable of so noble an undertaking -- how often are the lawrels worn by those who have had no share in earning them, but there is a future recompence of reward to which the upright man looks, and which he will most assuredly obtain provided he perseveres unto the end. -- The appointment of the Generals Washington and Lee, gives universal satisfaction. The people have the highest opinion of Lees abilities, but you know the continuation of the popular Breath, depends much upon favorable events. I had the pleasure of seeing both the Generals and their Aid de camps soon after their arrival and of being personally made known to them. They very politely express their regard for you. Major Miflin said he had orders from you to visit me at  Braintree. I told him I should be very happy to see him there, and accordingly sent Mr. Thaxter to  Cambridge with a card to him and  to dine with me. Mrs. Warren and her Son were to be with me. They very politely received the Message and lamented that they were not able to upon account of Expresses which they were that day to get in readiness to send of. I was struck with General Washington. You had  me to entertain a favorable opinion of him, but I thought the one half was not told me. Dignity with ease, and complacency, the Gentleman and Soldier look agreably blended in him. Modesty marks every line and feture of his face. Those lines of Dryden instantly occurd to me General Lee  looks like a careless hardy Veteran and from his  brought to my mind his namesake Charls the 12, king of  Sweeden. The Elegance of his pen far exceeds that of his person. I was much pleased with your Friend Collins. I persuaded them to stay coffe with me, and he was as unreserved and social as if we had been old acquaintances, and said he was very loth to leave the house. I would have detaind them till morning, but they were very desirous of reaching  Cambridge. You have made often and frequent complaints that your Friends do not write to you. I have  up some of them. Dr. Tufts, Col. Quincy, Mr. Tudor,Mr. Thaxter all have wrote you now, and a Lady whom I am willing you should value preferable to all others save one. May not I in my turn make complaints? All the Letters I receive from you seem to be wrote in so much haste, that they scarcely leave room for a social feeling. They let me know that you exist, but some of them contain scarcely six lines. I want some sentimental Effusions of the Heart. I am sure you are not destitute of them or are they all absorbed in the great publick. Much is due to that I know, but being part of the whole I lay claim to a Larger Share than I have had. You used to be more communicative a Sundays. I always loved a Sabeth days letter, for then you had a greater command of your time -- but hush to all complaints. I am much  that you have not been more accurately informd of what passes in the camps. As to intelegance from  Boston, tis but very seldom we are able to  collect any thing that may be relied upon, and to report the vague flying reports rumours would be endless. I heard yesterday by one Mr. Rolestone a Goldsmith who got out in a fishing Schooner, that there distress encreased upon them fast, their Beaf is all spent, their Malt and Sider all gone, all the fresh provisions they can procure they are obliged to give to the sick and wounded. 19 of our Men who were in Jail and were wounded at the Battle of  Charlstown were Dead. No Man dared now to be seen talking to his Friend in the Street, they were obliged to be within every evening at ten o clock according to Martial Law, nor could any inhabitant walk any Street in Town after that time without a pass from Gage. He has orderd all the melasses to be stilld up into rum for the Soldiers, taken away all Licences, and given out others obligeing to a forfeiture of ten pounds L M if any rum is sold without written orders from the General. He give much the same account of the kill'd and wounded we have had from others. The Spirit he says which prevails among the Soldiers is a Spirit of Malice and revenge, there is no true courage and bravery to be observed among them, their Duty is hard allways mounting guard with their packs at their back ready for an alarm which they live in continual hazard of. Doctor Eliot is not on bord a man of war, as has been reported, but perhaps was left in Town as the comfort and support of those who cannot escape, he was constantly with our prisoners. Mr. Lovel and Leach with others are certainly in jail. A poor Milch cow was last week kill'd in Town and sold for a shilling stearling per pound. The transports arrived last week from  York, but every additional Man adds to their distress. -- There has been a little Expidition this week to  Long Island. There has been before several attempts to go on but 3 men of war lay near, and cutters all round the Island that they could not succeed. A number of whale boats lay at  Germantown; 300 volenters commanded by one Capt. Tupper came on monday evening and took the boats, went on and brought of 70 odd Sheep, 15 head of cattle, and 16 
Page 4
prisoners 13 of whom were sent by Simple Sapling to mow the Hay which they had very badly executed. They were all a sleep in the house and barn when they were taken. There were 3 women with them. Our Heroes came of in triumph not being observed by their  [illegible]  Enimies. This spiritted up [others]. They could not rest endure the thought that the House and barn should afford them any shelter. They did not distroy them the night before for fear of being discoverd.Capt. Wild of this Town with about 25 of his company,Capt. Gold of  Weymouth with as many of his, and some other volenters to the amount of an 100,obtaind leave to go on and distroy the Hay together with the House and barn and in open day in full view of the men of war they set of from the Moon so call'd coverd by a number of men who were placed there, went on, set fire to the Buildings and Hay. A number of armed cutters immediately Surrounded the Island, fired upon our Men. They came of with a hot and continued fire upon them, the Bullets flying in every direction and the Men of Wars boats plying them with small arms. Many in this Town who were spectators expected every moment our Men would all be sacrificed, for sometimes they were so near as to be calld to and damnd by thetheirEnimies and orderd to surrender yet they all returnd in safty, not one Man even wounded. Upon the Moon we lost one Man from the cannon on board the Man of War. On the Evening of the same day a Man of War came and anchord near  Great Hill, and two cutters came to  Pig Rocks. It occasiond an alarm in this Town and we were up all Night. They remain there yet, but have not ventured to land any men. This Town have chosen their Representative. Col. Palmer is the Man. There was a considerable  upon Thayers side, and Vinions company marched up in order to assist, but got sadly dissapointed. Newcomb insisted upon it that no man should vote who was in the army -- he had no notion of being under the Military power -- said we might be so situated  as to have the greater part of the people engaged in the Military, and then all power would be wrested out of the hands of the civil Majestrate. He insisted upon its being put to vote, and carried his point immediately. It brought Thayer to his Speach who said all he could against it. -- As to the Situation of the camps, our Men are in general Healthy, much more so at  Roxbury than  Cambridge, and the Camp in vastly better order. General Thomas has the character of an Excelent officer. His Merit has certainly been over looked, as modest merrit generally is. I hear General Washington is much pleased with his conduct. Every article here in the  West  way is very scarce and dear. In six [weeks] we shall not be able to purchase any article of the kind. I wish you would let Bass get me one pound of peper, and 2 yd. of black caliminco for Shooes. I cannot wear leather if I go bare foot the reason I need not mention.Bass may make a fine profit if he layes in a stock for himself. You can hardly immagine how much we want many common small articles which are not manufactured amongst ourselves, but we will have them in time. Not one pin is to be purchased for love nor money. I wish you could convey me a thousand by any Friend travelling this way. Tis very provoking to have such a plenty so near us, but tantulus like not able to touch. I should have been glad to have laid in a small stock of the  West India articles, but I cannot get one copper. No person thinks of paying any thing, and I do not chuse to run in debt. I endeavour to live in the most frugal manner posible, but I am many times distressed. --Mr. Trot I have accommodated by removeing the office into my own chamber, and after being very angry and sometimes persuaideding I obtaind the mighty concession of the Bed room, but I am now so crouded as not to have a Lodging for a Friend that calls to see me. I must beg you would give them 7 warning to seek a place before Winter. Had that house been empty I could have had an 100 a year for it. Many [persons] had applied before Mr. Trot, but I wanted some part of it my self, and the other part it seems I have no command of. -- We have since I wrote you had many fine showers, and altho the crops of grass have been cut short, we have a fine prospect of Indian corn  and English grain. Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field, for the pastures of the Wilderness do spring, the Tree beareth her fruit, the vine and the olive yeald their fruit increase. We have not yet been much distressed for grain. Every thing at present looks blooming. O that peace would once more extend her olive Branch. Our little ones send Duty to pappa. You would smile to see them all gather round mamma upon the reception of a letter to hear from pappa, and  with open mouth, What does par say -- did not he write no more. And little Tom says I wish I could see par. Upon Mr. Rice's going into the army he asked Charls if he should get him a place, he catchd at it with great eagerness and insisted upon going. We could not put him of, he cryed and beged, no obstical we could raise was sufficent to satisfy him, till I told him he must first obtain your consent. Then he insisted that I must write about it, and has been every day these 3 weeks insisting upon my asking your consent. At last I have promised to write to you, and am obliged to be as good as my word. -- I have now wrote you all I can collect from every quarter. Tis fit for no eye but yours, because you can make all necessary allowances. I cannot coppy. There are yet in Town 4 of the Selectmen and some thousands of  inhabitants tis said. -- I hope to hear from you soon. Do let me know if there is any prospect of seeing you? Next Wedensday is 13 weeks since you went away. I must bid you adieu. You have many Friends  they have not noticed you by writing. I am sorry they have been so neglegent.  I hope no share of that blame lays upon me your most affectionate Mr. Cranch has in his possession a Barrel of Mrs. Wilkings Beer which belonged to the late Dr. Warren. He does not know what to do with it. Suppose you should take it and give credit for it, as there will be neither wine, lemmons or any thing else to be had but what we make ourselves. Write me your pleasure about it. "
"Braintree,  July 25, 1775
","Dearest Friend I received  yours of July 7  for which I heartily thank you, it was the longest and best Letter I have had, the most  and therefore the most Sentimental. Previous to your last I had wrote you and made some complaints of you, but I will take them all back again -- only continue your obliging favours whenever your time will allow you to devote one moment to your absent Portia. This is the 25 of July.  has not made any attempts to march out, since the Battle at  Charlstown. Our Army are restless and wish to be doing something to rid themselves and the land of the Virmin and Locusts which infest it. Since I wrote you last the Companys stationd upon the coasts both in this Town,  Weymouth and  Hingham were orderd to  Nantasket to reap and bring of the Grain which they accomplished, all except a field or two which was not ripe, and having whale boats they undertook to go to the light House and set fire to it, which they effected in open day and in fair sight of several men of War. Upon their return came down upon them Eight Barges, one cutter, one Schooner, all in Battle array, and pourd whole broad sides upon them, but our Men all reached the shore and not one life lost, two only slightly wounded in their legs. They marchd up a Hill and drew into order in hopes the marines would land, but they chose rather to return without a land engagement, tho tis Thought they will burn the Town down as soon as the our forces leave it. I had this account from Capt. Vinton who with his company were there. These little Skirmishes seem trifling, but they serve to innure our Men and harden them to Danger. I hear the Rebels are very Wroth at the distruction of the light House. There has been an offer from  to send the poor of Boston to  Salem by Water, but not complied with on our part. They returnd for answer they would receive them upon the lines. Dr. Tufts  saw a Letter from Deacon Newall in which he mentions the Death of John Cotton, says tis very sickly in Town. Every Fishing vessel is now obliged to enter and clear out as tho she was going a foreign Voyage, no inhabitant is sufferd to partake, but obliged to wait till the Army are supplied, and then if one remains they may beare allowed to  purchase it. An order has been given out in Town that no person shall be seen to wipe their faces with a white hankerchief. The reason I hear is, that tis a Signal of Mutiny. General Burgoine lives in Mr. Samll. Quincys House. A Lady who lived opposite says she saw raw meat cut and hacked upon her Mahogona Tables, and her superb damask curtain and cushings exposed to the rain as if they were of no value. How much better do the Tories fare than the Whigs? Suppose this worthy good Man was put in with all confidence that nothing should be hurt. I was very much pleased with Generals Lees Letter, and really entertaind a more favorable opinion of Burgoyne than I before had imbibed  [illegible]   from his Speah Speach, but a Late letter from  London wrote to Mr. Josiah Quincy and in case of his absence to be opened either by you or Mr. Samll. Adams or either of the Warrens has left me no room to think that he is possessd either of Generosity, Virtue or Humanity. His character runs thus -- As to Burgoyne I am not Master of Language sufficient to give you a true Idea of the Horrible wickedness of the Man. His designs are dark, His Dissimulation of the deepest die, for not content with deceiving Mankind he practices deceit on God himself, by Assuming the Appearance (like Hutchinson) of great attention to Religious Worship when every action of his life is totally abhorant to all Ideas of true Religion, Virtue or common Honesty. An Abandoned Infamous Gambler of Broken fortune and the Worst Most detestable of the  Bedford Gang who are wholly bent on Blood, tyrany and Spoil, and therefore the darling Favorite of our unrivalled Ruler Lord Bute. -- The character of How is not drawn much more favourably, But Clintons General character very good and tis said he does not relish the Service he is sent upon. I am ready to believe this of Clinton as I have never heard of any  of his since his arrival, nor scarcely any mention of him. That such characters as Burgoynes and Hows should engage in such a cause is not to be wonderd at, but really to be lamented when a Man possessd of one spark of virtue should be drawn aside, and disgrace himself and posterity by adding one  [illegible]   more to the already infamous List. -- Suppose you have heard of Darbys arrival, and the intelligance he brings. I could not refrain wishing them everlasting letters. The News received with some symptoms of pleasure  and our Friends increased and a few more such sugar plumbs. Were they suffering as we are, could Americans sit thus coldly whilst Brittons were a Bleading? How is it posible that the love of Gain and the Lust of domination should render the Humane mind so callous to every principal of honour, Generosity and Benevolence. May that day be far distant from  America when  unfeeling train shall usurp this land and dispossess the Swain. Your address meets with general approbation here, your   petitioning the King again pleases (forgive me if I say the timid and the weak) those persons who were esteemed the Luke Warm, and who think that are no Works of Supereragation can be performed to  Great Brittain -- whilst others say you heap coals of fire upon the Heads of your Enimies. You know you are considerd here as the most perfect body -- if one Member is by any means renderd incapable of acting tis supposed the difficency will be made up. The Query is why your president left the Congress so long as to make it necessary to chuse an other Member, whether he declined returning to you again? Suppose you have a list of our Counsel. It was generally thought that  would make an attempt to come out either Election Day or upon the Fast, but I could not believe we should be disturbed upon that Day, even the Devils believe and tremble, and I really believe they are more affraid of the Americans prayers than their Swords. I could not bear to hear our inanimate old Batchelor.Mrs. Cranch and I took our chaise and went to hear Mr. Haven of  Deadam, and We had no occasion to repent Eleven miles ride. Especially as I had the pleasure of spending the day with my name sake and Sister Delegate. Why should we not assume your titles when we give you up our names. I found her comfortably situated, in a little  Country cottage with patience, perseverance and fortitude for her companions, and in better Health than she has enjoyed for many months past. I fear General Thomas being overlooked and Heath placed over him will create much uneasiness. I know not who was to blame, but it is like to make a great and fatal Gap in the Army. If Thomas resigns all his officers resign; and Mr. Thomas cannot with  hold under Heath. The Camp will evince to every Eye how good an officer he has been -- but this is out of my Sphere. I only say what others say and what the general disposition of the people is. I believe you will not complain that I do not write often enough and lengthy enough. When you are tired tell me. Pray make my  to Mr. Barrel for his great civility to Portia. I really feel very anxious to be exposed to any Eyes but yours whose partiality I have so often Experienced to cover a multitude of faults that I rely upon it with the utmost Security. -- You will not faill letting me hear from you by every opportunity. All our little folks send duty to pappa.Johnny says do you think Mamma pappa will write to me -- has not he so many things to do that he will forget me. Brother and Sister Cranch send their Love. My Mother says I must always remember to add hers to you when I write. I need not say how much I want to see you, but no one will credit my story of your returning in a month. I hope to have the best of proofs to convince them --  it cannot need any to convince you how sincerely I am your most affectionate "
"Braintree July 31 1775
","I do not feel easy more than two days together without writing to you. If you abound you must lay some of the fault upon yourself, who have made such sad complaints for Letters, but I really believe I have wrote more than all my Sister Delegates. Their is nothing new transpired since I wrote you last, but the sailing of some transports, and 5 deserters having come into our camp. One of them is gone I hear to . I think I should be cautious of him -- no one can tell the secret designs of such fellows whom no oath binds -- he may be sent with assassinating designs. I can credit any viliny that a Ceasar Borgea would have been guilty of -- or Satan himself would rejoice in. Those who do not scruple to bring poverty, Misiry, Slavery and Death upon thousands will not hesitate at the most diabolical crimes -- and this is  Brittain. Blush o! Americans that ever tho thou derivest thy origin from such a race. We learn  from one of these Deserters that our ever valued Friend Warren, dear to us even in Death; was  [not] treated with any more respect than a common soldier, but the  [savage] wretches call'd officers consulted together and agreed to sever his Head from his body, and carry it in triumph to Gage, who no doubt would have "" grin'd horrible a gastly smile,"" instead of imitating Ceasar who far from being gratified with so horrid a Spectacle, as the Head even of his Enimy, turned away from Pompeys with disgust and gave vent to his pitty in a flood of tears. ""How much does pagan tenderness put christian Benevolence to shame."" What Humanity could not obtain, the rights and ceremonies of a Mason demanded. An officer who it seems was one of the  requested that as a Mason he might have the body unmangled, and find a decent interment for it. He obtaind his request, but upon returning to secure it, he found it already thrown into the Earth, only with the ceremony of being first placed there, with many bodies over him Thus far I wrote and broke . Hearing there was a probability of your return I thought not to send it, but the reception of  yours this morning of July 23 , makes me think the Day [ farthur ] [off] than I hoped. I therefore will add a few lines tho very unfit. I have had a very Ill Night. Just recoverd from the rash, I went out yesterday to attend the funeral of a poor fellow who the Night before fell in Battle as they were returning from the Light house. (I catchd some cold.) A Sabbeth Evening there was a warm fire from  Prospect Hill and  Bunkers Hill, begun first by the Riffel men taking of their Gaurds. 2 Men upon our side were kill'd, 5 of their guards were killd, 2 taken. I believe my account will be very confused, but I will relate it as well as I am able. A Sabbeth Evening a number of Men in Whale Boats went of from  Squantom and  Dorchester to the light house, where the General Gage had again fixd up a Lamp, and sent 12 carpenters to repair it. Our people went on amidst a hot fire from 30 Marines who were placed there as a guard to the tory carpenters, burnt the dwelling house, took the Torys and 28 Marines, kill'd the Leiunt. and one Man, brought of all the oil and stores which were sent, without the looss of a man till they were upon their return when they were so closely persued that they were obliged to run one whale boat ashore and leave her to them. The rest arrived safe except the unhappy youth whose funeral I yesterday attended, who received a Ball thro the temples as he was rowing the boat. He belong'd to  Road Island. His name was Griffin. He with 4 wounded Marines was brought by Capt. Turner to  Germantown and buried from their with the Honours of War. Mr. Wibird upon the occasion made the best oration (he never prays you know) I ever heard from him. The poor wounded  [fellows] (who are all wounded in their arms) desired they might attend. They did and he very pathetacally addressd them; with which they appeard affected. I spoke with them. I told them it was very unhappy that they should be obliged to fight their best Friends. They said they were sorry -- they hoped in God an end would be speadily put to the unhappy contest. When they came, they came in the way of their Duty to releave Admiral Montague -- with no thoughts of fighting -- but their  
Page 3
 situation was such as obliged them to obey orders, but they wish'd with all their souls they that sent them here had been in the heat of the Battle, express'd gratitude at the kindness they received, said in that they had been deceived, for they were told if they were taken alive, they would should be Sacrificed by us. Dr. Tufts Dress'd their wounds. I had a design to have wrote you something about a  of appointment of a Friend of Mine to a judicial [illegible]   Department, but hope soon to see that Friend, before his acceptance may be necessary. I enclose a complement coppied by a Gentleman from a peice in the  Worcester paper signed Lycurgus. I can add no more as the good Col. Palmer Waits only my compliments to Mrs. Miflin, and tell her I do not know whether her Husband is safe here. Belona and Cupid have a contest about You hear nothing from the Ladies, but about Major  [Miflins] easy address, politeness, complasance &c. &c. Tis till well he has so agreable a Lady at  Phyladelphia. They know nothing about forts, intrenchments &c. when they return 5 or if they do they are all forgot and swallowed up in his accomplishments.  Adieu my Dearest Friend and  believe me unalterably yours,  "
"Braintree  August 10 1775
","Dearest Friend Tis with a sad Heart I take my pen to write to you because I must be the bearer of what will greatly afflict and distress you. Yet I wish you to be  for the Event. Your Brother Elihu lies very dangerously sick with a Dysentery. He has been very bad for more than a week, his life is despaired of. Er'e I close this Letter I fear I shall write you that he is no more. We are all in great distress. Your Mother is with him in great anguish. I hear this morning that he is sensible of his Danger, and calmly resigned to the will of Heaven; which  is a great Satisfaction to his mourning Friend's. I cannot write more at present than to assure you of the Health of your own family. Mr. Elisha Niles lies very bad with the same disorder. -- Adieu. I have this morning occasion to sing of Mercies and judgments. May I properly notice each -- a mixture of joy and grief agitate my Bosom. The return of thee my dear partner after a four months absence is a pleasure I cannot express, but the joy is overclouded, and the Day is darkened by the mixture of Grief and the Sympathy I feel for the  of your Brother, cut of in the pride of life and the bloom of Manhood! in the midst of his usefulness; Heaven  [sanctify] this affliction to us, and make me properly thankful that it is not my sad lot to mourn the loss of a Husband in the room of a Brother. May thy life be  and thy Health confirmed for the benefit of thy Country and the happiness of thy family is the constant supplication of thy Friend.  "
"Braintree  Sepbr. 8, 1775
","Dearest Friend Since you left me I have passed  great distress both of Body and mind; and whether greater is to be my portion Heaven only knows. You may remember Isaac was unwell when you went from home. His Disorder increasd till a voilent Dysentery was the consequence of his complaints, there was no resting place in the House for his terible Groans. He continued in this state near a week when his Disorder abated, and we have now hopes of his recovery. Two days after he was sick, I was seaz'd with the same disorder in a voilent manner. Had I known you was at  Watertown I should have sent Bracket for you. I sufferd greatly betwen my inclination to have you return, and my fear of sending least you should be a partaker of the common calamity. After 3  [days] an abatement of my disease relieved me from that anxiety. The next person in the same week was Susy. She we carried home, hope she will not be very bad. Our Little Tommy was the next, and he lies very ill now -- there is no abatement at present of his disorder. I hope he is not dangerous. Yesterday Patty was seazd and took a puke. Our House is an hospital in every part, and what with my own weakness and distress of mind for my family I have been unhappy enough. And such is the distress of the  that I can scarcly find a well person to assist me in looking after the sick. Mrs. Randle  [Randall] has one child that is not expected to live out the night, Mrs. Belcher has an other,Joseph Bracket an other,Deacon Adams has lost one, but is upon the recovery himself, and so are the rest of his family. Mr. Wibird lies bad. Major Miller is dangerous.Revd. Mr. Gay is not expected to live. So sickly and so Mortal a time the oldest Man does not remember. I am anxious for you. Pray let me hear from you soon. I thought you would have left me a Letter at  Watertown as you  so long there. I was disapointed that you did not. -- As to politicks I know nothing about them. The distresses of my own family are so great that I have not thought about them. I have wrote as much as I was as am able to, being very week. I hope to add a more pleasing account er'er I close. Adieu. Tis now two days since I wrote. As to my own Health I mend but very slowly -- have been fearful of a return of my disorder  but feel rather better now. Hope it is only oweing to my having been fatigued with looking after Tommy as he is unwilling any body but Mamma should do for him, and if he was I could not find any body that is worth having but what are taken up already with the sick. Tommy I hope is mending, his fever has abated, his Bowels are better, but was you to look in upon him you would not know him, from a hearty hale corn fed Boy, he is become pale lean and wan. Isaac is getting better, but very slowly.Patty is very bad. We cannot keep any thing down that she takes, her situation is very dangerous. Mr. Trot and one of his children are taken with the disorder. I shall write every day if I am able. Pray let me hear from you often. Heaven preserve both your life and health and all my sufferings will be but small. By the first safe conveyance be kind  to send me 1 oz. of turkey Rhubub, the root, and to procure me 1 quarter lb. of nutmegs for which here I used to give 2.8 Lawful, 1 oz. cloves, a of cinnamon. You may send me only a few of the nutmegs till Bass returns. I should be glad of 1 oz. of Indian root. So much sickness has occasiond a scarcity of Medicine.   this. Such a doleful tale it contains [illegible]   can give no pleasure to any one. Our other children are well and send Duty to pappa. Bracket has been complaining but has got better. The small pox in the natural way was never more mortal than this Distemper has proved in this and many neighbouring Towns. 18 have been buried since you left us in the other Mr. Welds parish. 4, 3 and 2 funerals in a day for many days. Heitherto our family has been greatly favourd. Heaven still preserve us. Tis a melancholy time with us. I hope you will not think me in the dismals, but publick and private judgments ought to be noticed by every one.  I am most affectionately Yours,  "
"Braintree  Sepbr. 16  [i.e. 17] Sunday 1775
","I set myself down to write with a Heart depressed with the Melancholy Scenes  me. My Letter will be only a Bill of Mortality, tho thanks be to that Being who restraineth the pestilence, that it has not yet proved mortal to any of our family, tho we live in daily Expectation that Patty will not continue many hours. A general putrefaction seems to have taken place, and we can not bear the House only as we are constantly clensing it with hot vinegar. I had no Idea of the Distemper in producing such a state as hers till now. Yet we take all posible care by shifting her bed every day. Two of the children John and Charlss I have sent out of the house, finding it difficult to keep them out of the chamber. Nabby continues well. Tommy is better, but intirely striped of the hardy robust countanance as well as of all the flesh he had, save what remains for to keep his bones together. Jonathan is the only one who remains in the family but what has had a turn of the disorder. Mrs. Randle has lost her daughter,Mrs. Bracket hers, Mr. Thomas Thayer his wife. 2 persons belonging to  Boston have died this week in this parish. I know of eight this week who have been buried in this Town. In  Weymouth it is very sickly, but not Mortal. Dr. Tufts  me he has betwen 60 and 70 patients now sick with this disorder. Mr. Thaxter has been obliged to go home as it was not posible for me to accommodate him. Mr. Mason came this week, but if he had been inclined I could not have taken him now. But the general Sickness in the Towns determined him to return home for the present. The dread upon the minds of people of catching the distemper is almost as great as if it was the small pox. I have been distress'd more than ever I was in my life to procure watchers and to get assistance. I hear Mr. Tudor has been dangerously sick, but is now upon the recovery.Mr. Wibird is very low indeed,  able to walk a step. We have been 4 Sabbeths without any meeting. Thus does pestilence travel in the rear of War to remind us of our intire dependance upon that Being who not only directeth the arrow by day, but has also at his command the pestilence which walketh in Darkness. So uncertain and so transotory are all the enjoyments of Life that were it not for the tender [illegible]   tender connections which bind us here, would it not be folly to wish for a continuance here? I think I shall never be  be wedded to the World, and were I to loose about a Dozen of my dearest Connections I should have nofather further realish for Life. But perhaps I deceive , and know but little of my own Heart; ""To Bear and Suffer is our portion here."" And unto him  mounts the Whirlwind and directs the StormI will chearfully leave the ordering of my Lot, and whether adverse or prosperous Days should be my future portion I will trust in his right Hand to lead me safely thro, and after a short rotation of Events fix me in a state immutable and happy. You will think me melancholy. Tis true I am much affected with the  Scenes around me but I have some Anxietyes upon my mind which I do not think it prudent to mention at present to any one. Perhaps when I hear from you, I may in my next Letter tell you. In the mean time I wish you would tell me whether the intercepted Letters have reachd Phyladelphia and what affect they have there. There is a most infamous versification of them I hear sent out. I have not been able to get it. As to politicks there seems to be a dead calm upon all sides. Some of the Tories have been sending out their children.Col. Chandler has sent out his children, and Mr. Winslow has sent out his daughter. People appear to be gratified with the remonstrance, address and petition, and most earnestly long for further intelegance. God helps them that help themselves as King Richard said and if we can obtain the divine aid by our own virtue, fortitude and perseverance we may be sure of . Tomorrow will be 3 weeks since you left home in all which time I have not heard one word from you. Patience is a Lesson I have not to learn so can wait your own time, but hope it will not be long er'e my anxious heart is releaved. Adieu.  I need not say how sincerely I am your affectionate  "
"Braintree  Sepbr. 25 1775
","Dearest Friend I set down with a heavy Heart to write to you. I have had no other since you left me. Woe follows Woe and one affliction treads upon the heal of . My distress for my own family having in some measure abated; tis excited anew upon the distress of my dear Mother. Her kindness brought her to see me every day when I was ill and our little Tommy. She has taken the disorder and lies so bad that we have little hopes of her Recovery. She is possess'd with the Idea that she shall not recover, and I fear it will prove but too true. In this Town the distemper seems to have abated. We have none now so bad as Patty. She has lain 21 days, each day we had reason to think would be her last, but  good Constitution, and youth for ought I know will finally conquer the distemper. She is not able to get out of Bed, nor can she help herself any more than a new born infant. Yet their are symptoms which now appear in her favour. The desolation of War is not so distressing as the  made by the pestilence. Some poor parents are mourning the loss of 3, 4 & 5 children, and some families are wholy striped of every Member. Wherefore is it that we are thus contended with? How much reason have I for thankfulness that all my family are  whilst so many others are striped of their parents, their children, their husbands. O kind Heaven  spair my parents, spair my Dearest Friend and grant him   Health. Continue the lives and health of our dear children. Sister Adams Sister Elihu Adams lost her youngest child last night with this disorder. I can add no more than Supplications for your welfare, and an ardent desire to hear from you by every opportunity. It will alleviate every trouble thro which it may be my Lot to pass.  I am most affectionately your distress'd Portia   "

","Dearest Friend I received your kind  of the 17. It was a Cordial to my dejected Heart to see and hear of your safe arrival in good Health and Spirits. Many are the Mercies of Heaven towards me.  I feel myself severely chastned yet I would not be unmindful either of the favours or frowns of him who hath said that he doth not afflict willingly.Tis allotted me to go from the sick and allmost dyeing Bed of one of my the Best of parents to my own habitation, where again I behold the same Scene, only varied by a remoter connextion -- ""A Bitter change, severer for severe."" I go to my Mother, and stay 12 hours with her, and then am obliged to return home to the most gastly object my Eyes ever beheld, who is continually desirous of my being with her the little While she expects to live, and who is now become such a putrid mass as scarcely to be able for any one to do their Duty towards her. You can more easily conceive than I  what are the sensations of my Heart, when absent from either, continually expecting a Messenger with the fatal tidings; er'e this will reach you I suppose you will have received a Catalogue of my afflictions. In past years small has been my portion of the Bitter Cup in comparison with many others. But there is now prepairing for me I fear,  [illegible]   a large draught thereof. May I be enabled to submit with patience and resignation to the rod and him who hath appointed it, knowing it is directed by unerring wisdom. The consolations of Religion are the only sure comforters in the day of affliction. They are not Buried in the dust, they journey not from us, nor can they be wrested from the mind by the lawless rapine of tyrants. Thus far I wrote but could add no more till this morning. The Doctor is just gone, but alas he gives me no hopes, as he can see no symptoms upon which he can Build. I go  to give a respit to my sisters. All our dear little  are well.Tommy looks cleverly. Patty still lives beyond any thing we could expect. Yesterday we thought her dyeing, but she revived again. You must write me by every opportunity. You will not expect  to look abroad for any news. I hope you will have every intelegance from others much better than can be given you by your afflicted  "

","Have  upon me, have pitty upon me o! thou my beloved for the Hand of God presseth me soar. Yet will I be dumb and silent and not open my mouth becaus thou o Lord hast done it. How can I tell you (o my bursting Heart) that my Dear Mother has Left me, this day about 5 oclock she left this world for an infinitely better. After sustaining 16 days severe conflict nature fainted and she fell asleep. Blessed Spirit where art thou? At times I almost am ready to faint under this severe and heavy Stroke,  from thee who used to be a comfortar towards me in affliction, but blessed be God, his Ear is not heavy that he cannot hear, but he has bid us call upon him in time of Trouble. I know you are a sincere and hearty mourner with me and will, pray for me in my affliction. My poor father like a firm Believer and a Good christian sets before his children the  best of Examples of patience and submission. My sisters send their Love to you and are greatly afflicted. You often Express'd your anxiety for me when you left me before, surrounded with Terrors, but my trouble then was as the small drop dust in the balance compaird to what I have since endured. I hope to be properly mindful of the correcting hand, that I may not be rebuked in anger. -- You will pardon and forgive all my wanderings of mind. I cannot be correct. Tis a dreadful time with this whole province. Sickness and death are in almost every family. I have no more shocking and  Idea of any Distemper except the Plague than this. Almighty God restrain the pestilence which walketh in darkness and wasteth at noon day and which has laid in the dust one of the dearest of parents.  May the Life of the other be  out to his afflicted children and Your distressd  "
"Braintree  october 9, 1775
","I have not been composed enough to write you since Last  when in the bitterness of my soul, I wrote a few confused lines, since which time it has pleased the great disposer of all Events to add Breach to Breach -- The day week that I was  to attend a dying parents Bed I was again call'd to mourn the loss of one of my own Family. I have just returnd from attending Patty to the Grave. No doubt long before this will reach you, you have received a melancholy train of Letters in some of which I mention her as dangerously sick. She has lain 5 weeks wanting a few days so bad as that we had little hopes of her Recovery; the latter part of the Time she was the most shocking object my Eyes ever beheld, and so loathsome that it was with the utmost dificulty we could bear the House. A mortification took place a week before she dyed,nothing but duty and humanity could and renderd her a most pityable object. We have great sickness yet in the Town; she made the fourth Corpse that was this day committed to the Ground. We have many others now so bad as to dispair of their lives. But Blessed be the Father of Mercies all our family are now well, tho I have my apprehensions least the malignincy of the air in the House may have infected some of them, we have fevers of various kinds, the Throat Distemper as well as the Dysentery prevailing in this and the Neighbouring Towns. How long o Lord shall the whole land say I am sick? O  us wherefore it is that thou art thus contending with us? In a very perticuliar manner I have occasion to make this inquiry who have had Breach upon Breach, nor has one wound been permitted to be healed e'er it is made to Blead affresh, in six weeks I count 5 of my near connections laid in the grave. Your Aunt Simpson died at  Milton about ten days ago with the Dysentery. But the heavy stroke which most of all distresses me is my dear Mother. I cannot overcome my too selfish sorrow, all her tenderness towards me, her care and anxiety for my welfare at all times, her watchfulness over my infant years, her advice and instruction in maturer age; all, all  her memory to me, and highten my sorrow for her loss. At the same time I know a patient submission is my duty. I will strive to obtain it! But the lenient hand of time alone can blunt the keen Edg of Sorrow. He who deignd to weep over  a departed Friend, will surely forgive a sorrow which at all times desires to be bounded and restrained, by a firm Belief that a Being of infinite wisdom and unbounded Goodness, will carve out my portion in tender mercy towards me! Yea tho he slay me I will trust in him said holy job. What tho his corrective Hand hath been streatched against me; I will not murmer. Tho earthly comforts are taken away I will not repine, he who gave them has surely a right to limit their duration, and has continued them to me much longer than I deserved. I might have been striped of my children as many others have been. I might o! forbid it Heaven, I might have been left a solitary widow. Still I have many  left, many comforts to be thankfull for, and rejoice in. I am not left to mourn as one without hope. My dear parent knew in whom she had Believed, and from the first attack of the distemper she was  it would prove fatal to her. A solemnity possess'd her soul, nor could you force a smile from her till she dyed. The voilence of her disease soon weakened her so that she was unable to converse, but whenever she could speak, she testified her willingness to leave the world and an intire resignation to the Divine Will. She retaind her senses to the last moment of her Existance, and departed the World with an easy tranquility, trusting in the merrits of a Redeamer. Her passage to immortality was marked with a placid smile upon her countanance, nor was there to be seen scarcly a vestage of the king of Terrors. Forgive me then, for thus dwelling upon a subject sweet to me, but I fear  to you. O how I have long'd for your Bosom to pour forth my sorrows there, and find a healing Balm, but perhaps that has been denyed me that I might be led to a higher and a more permamant consolater who has bid us call upon him in the day of trouble. As this is the first day since your absence that I could write you that we were all well, I desire to mark it with  gratitude, and humbly hope that all my warnings and corrections are not in vain. I most thankfully received  your kind  of the 26  yesterday. It gives me much  pleasure to hear of your Health. I pray Heaven for the continuance of it. I hope for the future to be able to give you more intelegance with regard to what passes out of my own little circle, but such has been my distress that I knew nothing of the political world. You have doubtless heard of the  of one who has professd himself a patriot, but let not that man be trusted who can voilate private faith, and cancel solem covanants, who can leap over moral law, and laugh at christianity. How is he to be bound whom neither honour nor conscience holds? -- We have here a Rumor that  Rhodiland has shared the fate of  Charlstown -- is this the Day we read of when Satan was to be loosed? I do not hear of any inhabitants getting out of Town. Tis said  is superceeded and How in his place, and that How released the prisoners from Gaoil. Tis also said tho not much credited that Burgoine is gone to  Philadelphia. I hope to hear from you soon. Adieu. Tis almost twelve o clock at Night. I have had so little Sleep that I must bid you good Night.  With hearty wishes for your return I am most sincerely Your  "
"Braintree  October 21, 1775
","Tis ten Days since I have wrote you a line;  I have received one Letter since dated 27 of   You do not mention having heard from me altho I have wrote six Letters. I thought I should have heard oftner from you in this absence than I had ever done before, but it has been quite otherways. I never found the communication so difficult, and tis only in my Night visions that I know any thing about you. I have now the pleasure to tell you that we are all well.  has had an ill turn since I wrote, but soon got better. Mr. Thaxter and Mr. Mason are returnd to me, and my family begins again to appear as it used to. Hayden does not stir. Says he will not go out of the parish unless he is carried out -- and here nobody will let him come in. I have offerd him part of the House that Field is in if he will but go out, but no where suits, and it is not to be wonderd at as he has wood at free cost and has plunderd pretty well from the family they live with  many articles. I have a great mind to send a sheriff and put him out. The sickness has abated here and in the  Towns. In  Boston I am told it is very sickly among the inhabitants and the soldiry. By a Man one Haskings who came out the day befor yesterday I learn; that there are but about 25 hundred Soldiers in Town. How many there are at  Charlstown he could not tell. He had been in Irons 3 weeks, some malicious fellow having said that he saw him at the Battle of  Lexinton, but he proved that he was not out of  Boston that day, upon which he was releazd, and went with two other men out in a small boat under their Eye to fish. They play'd about near the shore a while catching small fish, till they thought they could possibly reach  Dorchester Neck; no sooner were they perceived attempting to escape than they had 20 cannon dischargd at them, but they all happily reachd the shore. He says no Language can paint the distress of the inhabitants, most of them destitute of wood and of provisions of every kind. The Bakers say unless they have a new supply of wood they cannot bake above one fortnight longer -- their Bisquit are not above one half the former size. The Soldiers are obliged to do very hard duty, and are uneasy to a great degree, many of them declareing they will not continue much longer in such a state but at all hazards will escape; the inhabitants are desperate, and contriveing means of escape. A floating Battery of ours went out two nights ago, and went row'd near the Town, and then discharged their Guns. Some of the Ball went into the Work house, some through the Tents in the common, and one through the Sign of the Lamb Tavern; he says it drove them all out of the common, Men, women and children screaming, and throe'd them into the utmost distress. But very unhappily for us in the discharge of one of the cannon, the Ball not being properly ramed down one of them split and killd 2 men and wounded 7 more, upon which they were obliged to return. He also says that the Tories are much distressd about the fate of Dr. Church, and very anxious to obtain him, and would exchange Lovel for him. This Man is so exasperated at the ill usage he has received from them that he is determined to inlist immediately. They almost starved him whilst he was in Irons, he says he hopes it will be in his power to send some of them to Heaven for mercy. They are building a fort by the Hay market and rending down houses for timber to do it with. In the course of the last week several  have found means to escape. One of them says tis talked in Town that How will issue a proclamation giving Liberty to all who will not take up arms to depart the Town, and make it death to have any intercourse with the Country afterwards. At present it looks as if there was no likelihoods of peace. The Ministry are  to proceed at all events. The people are already slaves, and have neither virtue or spirit to help themselves or us. The time is hastning when Gorge like Richard may cry a kingdom a kingdom for a horse, and want even that wealth to make the purchase. I hope by degrees we shall be  to hardships and become a vituous valient people, forgetting our formour Luxery and each one apply with industery and frugality to Manufactory and husbandery till we rival all other Nations by our Virtues. I thank you for your  account of the Quaker. Their great stress with regard to coulours in their dress &c. is not the only ridiculous part of their Sentiments with regard to Religious Matters. What are your thoughts with regard to Dr. Church? Had you much  of him? I think you had no intimate acquaintance with him. It is a matter of great Speculation what will be his punishment. The people are much enraged against him. If he is set at liberty, even after he has received a severe punishment I do not think he will be safe. He will be  and detested by every one, and many suspicions will remain in the minds of people with regard to our rulers; they are for supposing this person is not sincere and that they have jealousy of. Have you any prospect of returning. I hoped to have heard from you by the Gentlemen who came as a  here, but they have been here a week, and I have not any Letters. My Father and  desire to be rememberd to you. He is very disconsolate. It makes my heart ake to see him  and I know not how to go to the House; he said to me the other day child I see your Mother, go to what part of the house I will. I think he has lost almost as much flesh as if he had been sick, and Betsy poor Girl looks broke and worne with Grief. These near connextions how they twist and cling about the Heart and when torn of draw the best Blood from it Be so good as to present my Regards to . I hope she is very happy. Mrs. Warren call'd upon me on her Way to  Watertown. I wish I could as easily come to you, as she can go to  Watertown but tis my Lot. In the 12 years we have been married I believe we have not lived together more than six. If you could with any conveniancy procure me the articles I wrote for I should be very glad, more especially the needles and cloth. They are in such demand that we are really  for want of them. We have had abundance of rain since you left us. I hope the Sickness with which we have been excersised has not   Philadelphia. Mr. Wibird has not been able to preach since you left us, and is in a very low state. Our little ones are well.  is so fat he can scarcly see out of his Eyes, but is still excersiced with them fits. Dr. Tufts son is sick with a slow fever.  Adieu. I think of nothing further to add but that I am With the tenderest Regard your  Portia PS Since I wrote the above I have received a Letter by Mr. Bayard for which I thank you. It gives me pleasure to find you in so good health. I have heard this Evening that a Man of War has been sent to   to make a demand of wood, upon which an express was sent of to our camp, and the express says a few hours after he set out, he heard a smart cannonade. The truth has not yet reachd us. We are anxious to hear from  Canady. -- If you can procure me some Carolina pink root from any of the Apothecarys I wish you would for Tommy. We think knots of worms is the occasion of his fits. I have tried worm Seed, but it has no Effect. -- Write if you can to my Father and Sister. Send the news papers they are very acceptable.  "
"Braintree  october 22 1775
","Mr. Lorthorp  here this Evening and brought me  yours of the 1 of October  a day which will ever be rememberd by me, for it was the most distressing one I ever experienced. That morning I rose and went into my Mothers room, not apprehending her so near her Exit, went to her Bed with a cup of tea in my hand, raised her head to give it to her, she swallowed a few drops, gaspd and fell back upon her pillow, opend her Eyes with a look that pirced my Heart and which I never shall forget. It was the eagerness of a last look --  ""and O! the last sad silence of a Friend."" Yet she lived till 5 oclock that day, but I could not be with her.  prayed twice beside her Bed that day. God Almighty was with him and suported him that day and enabled him to go thro the Services of thatday it. It was his communion day. He had there a tender scene to pass through -- a young Grandaughter Betsy Cranch joining herself to the church, and a Beloved Wife dying to pray for -- weeping children, weeping and mourning parishoners all round him, for every Eye streamed, his own heart allmost bursting as he spoke. How painful is the recollection, yet how pleasing? I know I wound your Heart. Why should I? Ought I to give relief to my own by paining yours? My pen is always freer than my tongue. I have wrote many things to you that I suppose I never  could have talk'd. My Heart is made tender by repeated affliction. It never was a hard Heart. The death of Patty came very near me, having lived four years with me, under my care. I hope it will make me more continually mindful and  of all those who are still committed to my charge. Tis a great trust. I daily feel more and more of the weight and importance of it, and of my own inability. I wish I could have more of the assistance of my dearest Friend but these perilous times swallow him up. Mr. Lorthrope has given me this account of the demand upon  Falmouth. A Man of War and two tenders went down and sent to the inhabitants to demand their Arms and require them to Stand Nutur, they required time to consider, they gave them till nine oclock the next day, which time they  in removeing the women, children and the rest of their most valuable Effects out of Danger when they sent their answer in the Negative. Upon which they began a cannonade and were continuing it when the Express came away. --Hitchbourn and an other Gentleman got out of Town in a cana small Boat, one of the fogy nights we have had this week. I have not heard what intelegance he brings. An other person says that How enlarged all the prisoners but Lovel and he would not come out. I have since seen the  as tis call'd but tis as low as the mock oration tho no reflection upon your private character further than immoderately whiping your Schollers  when you kept School, a crime any one will acquit you of who knows you. As a specimen of the wit and humour it containd I will give you the title -- a pharaphrase upon the Second Epistle of John the round Head to James the prolocutor of the Rump parliment. Dear Devil &c. I had it, but it was when I was in so much distress that I cared nothing about it. I will mention when I see you the foolish conjectures of some who want always to be finding out something extraordinary in what ever happens. Mr. Cranchs family are well and send Love to you. Your Mother too, is always anxious for you, and is so apprehensive least a fleet should be sent to Bombard  Philadelphia that she has not much comfort. Brothers family are well except young  who had the dysentery very bad, and has left him Bereaved of his reason. Isaac is so far recoverd as to return after six weeks and Susy is returnd to me again. Our neighbours are now all getting well. I hope to hear often from you which is all the alleviation I have of your absence, and is next to seeing you the greatest comfort of your  "
October 25 1775,"I have been highly  this week past. No less than 5 Letters I have received from you. It is a releif to one to know that we have a Friend who shares our misfortunes and afflictions with us. Your Letters administer comfort to my wounded Heart. It will sometimes when of of my Gaurd swell and exceed the bounds I endeavour to set to it. It is natural to mourn the loss of any comforts in proportion to the pleasure and satisfaction we derived from them.  I have all immaginable reason to think my dear Mother far happier than she could be in this uncertain perplexing state of existance, and do not  [wish] her back again, yet my selfish Heart longs for  [her ]smiling countanance, her kind advice, her tender care, her prudent Example and her thousand amiable virtues. They are never out of my mind. I am continually recollecting her watchfulness over my infant years, her great care and assiduity to early instill religious principals into her children. Nor did she faill of her duty in her last hours but upon her dying Bed, gave counsel where she thought it most necessary. I wish I could have conversd more with her myself, but such a flood of tenderness would break in upon me that I could never converse with her as leaving me, tho she herself neither smiled nor weept during her whole sickness. Our Little ones were sufficiently affected at the loss of their worthy Grandmamma especially Nabby, and all but  Tommy followed her to the Grave. I am very sensible of  the truth of your observation with regard to their loss. The instruc  instructions of my own Grandmamma are as fresh upon my mind this day as any I ever received from my own parents and made as lasting and powerfull impressions. Every virtuous example has powerfull impressions in early youth. Many years of vice and vicious examples do not erase from the mind seeds sown in early life. They take a deep root, and tho often crop'd will spring again. I have been  with my Sister Cranch who is very ill, and the Doctor thinks threatned with a fever. I have little respite from trouble --""Life is a poor play."" Sister  too is very unwell. It continus very sickly in  Weymouth. All sorts of fevers, throat distemper and dysenterys prevail. In this Town it has abated. I have an invitation to dine  with Dr. Franklin, Mr. Bodwin,Dr. Cooper  [and] Lady at Coll. Quincys. If my Sister is better believe I shall  [accept] of it, as I have a great desire to see Dr. Franklin who I design to ask the favour of taking this. Poor  Falmouth has shared the fate of  ; are we become a Sodom? I would fain hope we are not. Unsearchable are the ways of Heaven who permitteth Evil to befall a city and a people by those very hands who were by them constituded the Gaurdians and protecters of them. We have done Evil or our Enimies would be at peace with us. The Sin of Slavery as well as many others is not washed away. A deserter came out of Town yesterday and says the General had given orders that no more Bread should be sold to the inhabitants by the Bakers, nor by the Soldiers but if any overplus  of their allowance they should return it to the Store and receive their money. Poor  poor inhabitants of  Boston what will be their fate? A milch Cow was carried into the market and there offerd for sale at a Quarter a dollor per pound. Now and then a poor Creature runs a risk and gets clear. Mr. Hardwick desires Mr. Bass would not forget his needles, and I would make the same request to you. I wrote for a few articles in the physical way. I assure you medicine is very scarce, the great Demand for it has  the Doctors. I would not croud you with articles, but hope you will remember my other bundle of pins, the price of one paper now amounts to what we used to give for a whole Bundle. Mr. Bass'es Father desires to be  to his Son and to acquaint him that they were all well. Your worthy Mother also desires her Love to you and is well. Adieu  late at night, past the midnight hour. I wish for a safe return. You have the honour of a commission of the peace in the house sent to me last week and I hear are appointed Chief justice. Mr. Read is an other of the justices. Who the rest are I have not heard. Once more adieu from yours Without a Signature  "
"November 5, 1775","I have been prevented writing you for more than a Week past by a Whitlow upon the fore finger of my right Hand. Tis now so tender that I can manage a pen but poorly. I hope you have received several Letters from me in this fortnight past. I wrote by Mr. Linch , and by Dr. Frankling the latter of whom I had the pleasure of dining with, and of admiring him whose character from my Infancy I had been taught to venerate. I found him social, but not talkative, and when he spoke something usefull droped from his Tongue; he was grave, yet pleasant, and affable. -- You know I make some pretensions to physiognomy and I thought I could read in his countanance the Virtues of his Heart, among which patriotism shined in its full Lusture -- and with that is blended every virtue of a christian, for a true patriot must be a religious Man. I have been led to think from a late Defection that he who neglects his duty to his Maker, may well be expected to be deficient and insincere in his duty towards the public. Even suppose Him topossess a large share of what is called honour and publick Spirit yet do not these Men by their bad Example, by a loose immoral conduct corrupt the Minds of youth, and vitiate the Morrals of the age, and thus injure the publick more than they can compensate by intrepidity, Generosity and Honour? Let revenge or ambition, pride, lust or profit  these Men to a base and vile action, you may as well hope to bind up a hungry tiger with a cobweb as to hold such debauched patriots in the visionary chains of Decency or to charm them with the intellectual Beauty of Truth and reason. But where am I running. I mean to thank you for all your obliging  lately received and tho some of them are very Laconick, yet were they to contain only two lines to tell me that you were well, they would be acceptable to me. I think however you are more apprehensive than you need to be. The Gentleman to whose care they have always been directed has been very kind in his conveyances and very careful. I hope however that it will not now be long before we shall have nearer interviews. You must tell me that you will return next Month. A late appointment will make it inconveniant (provided you accept) for you to go again to Congress. The little flock in receiving pappas Letters have been more gratified than they could have been by any other present. They are very proud of being thus noticed. I am much obliged by the Sermons lately received. The Dedication of  is both spirited and zealous. I was greatly pleased with it, but suppose it will be casting of pearl before Swine. It seems Humane Nature is the same  in all ages and Countrys. Ambition and avarice reign every where and where they predominate their will be bickerings after places of Honour and profit. There is an old adage kissing goes by favour that is daily verified. I enclose to you the paper you sent for. Your  in collecting facts will be very difficult, and the Sufferings of this people cannot be circumscribed with pen, ink and paper. Besides these Ministers of Satan are rendring it every day more and more difficult by their ravages and devastation, to tell a tale which will freeze the young Blood of succeeding Generations as well as harrow up the Souls of the present. Nothing new has transpired since I wrote you last. I have not heard of one persons escaping out of Town, nor of any  of any kind.  is very anxious to write, but has been confined for several days with a severe cold which has given him soar Eyes, but he begs me to make his Excuse and say that he has wrote twice before, but it did not please him well enough to send it. Nabby has been with her Aunt Betsy ever since her Grandmammas Death. Charlly and Tommy beg  [mamma] to thank pappa for their Letters, and wish they could  [write] to tell him so. Brother and Sister Cranch send their Love. Mrs. Cranch's disorder left her soon, the Sickness has greatly abated all round us. Your Mother speaks pathetically of you, and always sends her Love to you.  I will only ask you to Measure by your own the affectionate regard of Your Nearest Friend  "
"Braintree  Novbr. 12, 1775
","I received  yours of October 23 . I want to hear from you every day, and I always feel sorrow when I come to the close of a Letter. Your Time must be greatly , but little of it to spaire to the calls of Friendship, and I have reason to think I have the largest share of it. Winter makes  approaches fast. I hope I shall not be obliged to spend it without my dearest Friend, I know not how to think of it. The  you will receive before this reaches you, will I should think make a plain path, tho a dangerous one for you. I could not join to day in the petitions of our worthy parson, for a reconciliation betwen our, no longer parent State, but tyrant State, and these Colonies. -- Let us seperate, they are unworthy to be our Breathren. Let us renounce them and instead of suplications asforforlyformorly for their prosperity and happiness, Let us beseach the almighty to blast their counsels and bring to Nought all their devices. I have nothing remarkable to write you. A little Skirmish  last week. The perticuliars I have endeavourd to collect, but whether I have the facts right I am not certain. A Number of Cattle were kept at  Leachmores point where two Centinals were placed, in a high tide tis an Island. The Regulars had observed this and a Scheme was laid to send a Number of them over and take of the Stock. Accordingly a number of Boats and about 400 men were sent; they landed it seems, unperceived by the Centinals who were a sleep; one of whom they killed the other took prisoner. As soon as they were perceived, they pourd the cannon from  Prospect Hill upon them which sunk one of their Boats, but as the tide was very high, it was difficult getting over, and some time before any alarm was given. A Coll. Tomson of the Riffel Men, Marchd instantly with his Men, and tho a very stormy day, regarded not the tide, nor wated for Boats, but Marchd over, neck high in water, and dischargd their peices, when the Regulars ran without waiting for to get of their Stock, and made the best of their way to the opposite Shore. The General sent his thanks in a public manner to the brave officer and his Men.Major Mifflin I hear was there, and flew about  as tho he would have raisd the whole Army. May they never find us deficient in courage and Spirit. Our Army is exceedingly well supplied with every article but wood and provinder which is very scarce. As to provisions we should find no difficulty to vitual  Army full as large. Tis now very Healthy both in the Army, and country, we have had very long teadious rains for six weeks past; sometimes not more than one fair day in a week. All our Friends are well. My Father seems to be much broke by his great affliction, seems to have his care and anxiety doubled. I can perceive it in numberless instances. -- I hope you will be able to get his Sulky , as he wants it now it comes cold Weather very much. Dr. Frankling invited me to spend the winter in  Philidelphia. I shall wish to be there, unless you return. I have been like a nun in a cloister ever since you went away, have not been into any other house than my Fathers and Sisters, except once to Coll. Quincys. Indeed I have had no inclination for Company. My Evenings are lonesome and Melancholy. In the day time family affairs take of my attention but my Evenings are spent with my departed parent. I then ruminate upon all her care and tenderness, and I am sometimes lost, and  in a flood of tenderness e'er I am aware of it, or can call to my aid, my only props and support. I must bid you adieu  late at Night.  Most affectionately Yours.  "
November 27 1775,"Tis a fortnight to Night since I wrote you a line during which, I have been confined with the jaundice,  and a most violent cold; I yesterday took a puke which has releived me, and I feel much better to day. Many, very many people who have had the dysentery, are now afflicted both with the jaundice and Rhumatisim, some it has left in Hecticks, some in dropsies. The great and incessant rains we have had this fall, (the like cannot be recollected) may have  some of the present disorders. The jaundice is very prevelant in the Camp. We have lately had a week of very cold weather, as cold as January, and a flight of snow, which I hope will purify the air of some of the noxious vapours. It has spoild many hundreds of Bushels of Apples, which were designd for cider, and which the great rains had prevented people from making up. Suppose we have lost 5 Barrels by it. Col. Warren  last week to  Plymouth, so that I shall not hear any thing from you till he goes back again which will not be till the last of nextthis month. He  my Spirits greatly by telling me that the Court had prolonged your Stay an other month. I was pleasing myself with the thoughts that you would soon be upon your return. Tis in vain to repine. I hope the publick will reap what I sacrifice. I wish I knew what mighty things were fabricating. If a form of  is to be established here what one will be assumed? Will it be left to our assemblies to chuse one? and will not many men have many minds? and shall we not run into Dissentions among ourselves? I am more and more convinced that Man is a dangerous creature, and that power whether vested in many or a few is ever grasping, and like the grave cries give, give. The great fish swallow up the small, and he who is most strenuous for the Rights of the people, when vested with power, is as eager after the  of Goverment. You tell me of degrees of perfection to which Humane Nature is capable of arriving, and I believe it, but at the same time lament that our admiration should arise from the scarcity of the instances. The Building up a Great Empire, which was only hinted at by my correspondent may now I suppose be realized even by the unbelievers. Yet will not ten thousand Difficulties arise in the formation of it? The Reigns of  have been so long slakned, that I fear the people will not quietly submit to those restraints which are necessary for the peace, and security, of the community; if we seperate from  Brittain, what Code of Laws will be established. How shall we be governd so as to retain our  Liberties? Can any goverment be free which is not adminstred by general stated Laws? Who shall frame these Laws? Who will give them force and energy? Tis true your  [Resolutions] as a Body have heithertoo had the force of Laws. But will they continue to have? When I consider these things and the prejudices of people in  of Ancient customs and Regulations, I feel anxious for the fate of our Monarchy or Democracy or what ever is to take place. I soon get lost in a Labyrinth of perplexities, but whatever occurs, may justice and righteousness be the Stability of our times, and order arise out of confusion. Great difficulties may be surmounted, by patience and perseverance. I believe I have tired you with . As to news we have not any at all. I shudder at the approach of winter when I think I am to remain desolate. Suppose your weather is warm yet. Mr. Mason and Thaxter live with me, and render some part of my time less disconsolate. Mr. Mason is a youth who will please you, he has Spirit, taste and Sense. His application to his Studies is constant and I am much mistaken if he does not make a very good figure in his profession. I have with me now, the only Daughter of your Brother; I feel a tenderer affection for her as she has lost a kind parent. Though too young to be sensible of her own loss, I can  her. She appears to be a child of a very good Disposition -- only wants to be a little used to company. Our Little ones send Duty to pappa and want much to see him.Tom says he wont come home till the Battle is over -- some strange notion he has got into his head. He has got a political  to say to him when he returns. I must bid you good night. Tis late for one who am much of an . I was dissapointed last week in receiving a packet by the post, and upon unsealing it found only four news papers. I think you are more cautious than you need be. All Letters I believe have come safe to hand. I have Sixteen from you, and wish I had as many more.  Adieu. Yours.  "
"Braintree  December 10, 1775
","I received your obliging  by Mrs. Morgan, with the papers, and the other articles you sent which were very acceptable to me. As they are not to be purchased here, I shall be very choise of them. I have according to your desire been upon a visit to Mrs. Morgan, who keeps at Major Miflins. I had received a Message from Mrs. Mifflin some time agone  I would visit her. My Pappa who you know is very obliging in this way accompanied me, and I had the pleasure of drinking coffe with the Dr. and his Lady, the Major and his Lady and a Mr. and Mrs. Smith from  New York, A daughter of the famous Son of Liberty Capt. Sears,General Gates and Lee, a Dr. McHenery and a Mr. Elvin, with many others who were strangers to me. I was very politely entertaind and noticed by the Generals, more especially General Lee, who was very urgent with me to tarry in Town and dine with him and the Laidies present, at Hob Goblin Hall, but I excused my self. The General was determined that I should not only be acquainted with him, but with his companions too, and therefore placed a chair before me into which he orderd Mr. Sparder to mount and present his paw to me for a better acquaintance. I could not do otherways than accept it. -- That Madam says he is the Dog which Mr.  has renderd famous. I was so little while in company with these persons and the company so mixed that it was almost  to form any judgment of them. The Dr. appeard modest and his Lady affable and agreable. Major Mifflin you know I was allways an admirer of, as well as of his delicate Lady. I beleive Phyladelphia is an unfertile soil, or it would not produce so many unfruitfull women. I always conceive of these persons as wanting one addition to their happiness, but in these perilous times I know not whether it ought to be considerd as an infelicity, since they are certainly freed, from the anxiety every parent must feel for their rising ofspring. I drank  one day with General Sulivan upon  Winter Hill. He appears to be a Man of Sense and Spirit. His countanance denotes him of a warm constitution, not to be very sudenly [illegible]   moved, but when once roused, not very easily Lull'd. Easy and social, well calculated for a Military Station, as he  [seems] to be possess'd of those populour qualifications necessary to attach Men to him. By the way, I congratulate you upon our late noble acquisition of military Stores.  Tis a most Grand mortar I assure you. Surely heaven smiles upon us in many respects, and we have continually to speak of mercies as well as judgments. I wish our Gratitude may be any ways proportionate to our Benefits. I suppose in congress you think of every thing relative to trade and commerce, as well as other things, but as I have been desired to mention to you some things I shall not omit them. One is that their may some thing be done in a continental way with regard to Excise  upon Spiritous Liquors that each of the  New England colonies may be upon the same footing where as we formerly used to pay an Excise, and the other colonis none or very little by which means they drew away our trade. That an Excise is necessary tho it may be objected too by the mercantile intrissts, as a too frequent use of Spirit endangers the well being of Society. An other article is that some method may be devised to keep among us our Gold and Silver, which is now every day dreaming shiped of to the  West Indias for Molasses, Coffe, Sugar &c. This I can say of my own knowledg that a Dollor in Silver is now become a great rarity, and our Traders will give you a hundred pounds of paper for Ninety of Silver, or near that proportion. If any trade is alloud to the  West indias would it not be better to carry some commodity of our own produce in exchange? Medicine, Cotton Wool and some other articles we are in great want of. Formerly we used to purchase cotton wool at 1 Shilling Lawfull money pr. Bag, now tis 3, and the scarcity of that article distresses us, as it was wrought up with less trouble than any other article of cloathing. Flax is now from a Shilling to one and Sixpence pr. pound, Sheeps wool Eighteen pence and linnens not to be had at any price. I cannot mention the article in the English goods way which is not double, and in the  West India Molasses by retail I used formerly to purchase at one and Eight pence now tis 2 and Eight pence, rum 3 Shillings, coffe one and 3 pence &c. All other things in proportion. Corn is 4 Shillings pr. Bushel, rye 5, oats 3 and Eight pence, Hay 5 and Six Shilling pr. hundred, wood twenty Shillings pr. cord. But meat of all kinds cheap. I enclose a  of Dr. Tufts requesting you to procure for him those articles if you can bring them with any conveniance. The Dr. takes it  a little hard that you have never wrote him a line, as he has wrote you several times. If it was but a few lines he would Receive it kindly. I am very  to trouble you about articles of conveniancy for myself, especially as they are so much out of your way of Buisness. I will only mention two or three which if you can direct Bass to get for me will much oblige me -- one black  Barcelona hankerchief, two or 3 yd. of black Caliminco for shooes and binding for the same -- he knows how much will be proper -- and 3 or 4 common manchester check hankerchiefs for the pocket. Not a hankerchief of any kind can be purchased here, but out of the Store for the Army, and they are allowd only to those who inlist. My Pappa would be glad you would send him a Sermon of Dr. Zublys. My  Quincy desires to be rememberd to you, inquired when you talked of comeing home. I told him you had not fixed any time. He says if you dont come soon he would advice me to procure an other husband. He of all persons ought not to give such advice I told him unless he set a better example himself. Be kind enough to burn this Letter. Tis wrote in great haste and a most incorrect Scrawl it is but I cannot conclude it without telling you we are all very angry with your House of Assembly for their instructions. They raise prejudices in the minds of people and serve to create in their minds a terror at a  from a people wholy unworthy of us. We are a little of the Spanel kind.Tho so often spurned still to [illegible]   fawn argues a meaness of Spirit that as an individual I disclaim, and would rather endure any hardships than submit to it. Our Little folks are all well and long  for Pappas return, in which wish their Mamma most sincerely joins them.  Yours. I often meet with a , open a cover with eager expectations and find only a news paper, but I know your avocations will not suffer you to write so often as you  [wish].  "
"Febry 21, 1776","Tis a month this day since you left me, and this is the first time I have taken my pen to write to you. My conscience accuses me, but I have waited in hopes of having something worth saying to you, some event worth relating; but it has been a dead calm of dull repose. No event of any importance upon either side excepting the burning of some houses by the Enemy upon  Dorchester Neck has taken place since you left us. The preparations increase and something great is daily expected, something  it will be. I impatiently wait for, yet dread the day. --I received a Letter from you wrote at  Watertown, and a Book Last week; for which I am much obliged, tis highly prized here and carries conviction whereever it is read. I have spread it as much as it lay in my power, every one assents to the weighty truths it contains. I wish it could gain Credit enough in your assembly to be carried speadily into Execution. I have been uneasy upon your account. I know your delicacy must be wounded by the unjust and malicious censures of an unworthy associate, whose self conceit and vanity really makes him an object of contempt,  and commisiration. He has not only treated your character in a very abusive and ungentlemanlike manner, but descended to low vulgar attacks and Language upon our Worthy Friend. I think from the temper in which he writes you cannot avoid altercation with him, but I hope you will be guarded. Envy and vanity will do his work very effectually. ""To all my foes dear fortune sent thy Gifts"" ""But never to my Friends."" ""I tamely can endure the first"" ""But this with envy makes me Burst."" I must beg the  of you to send me a quire of paper, or I know not whether I shall be able to write you an other Letter. We cannot get any here. I was obliged to beg this, and your Daughter requests a blank Book or two. If Mack Fingal  is published be so good as to send it. The army is full, more men now in camp than has been since the army was first together. Not very sickly there, But in the Country the  fever prevails and is very mortal. We have lost 3 grown persons in this part of the Town this week. Many others lay bad-it carries them of in 8 days. All our Friends send Love. Write me by every opportunity and believe me at all times Yours.  "
"Saturday Evening Febry March 2, [1776]","I was greatly rejoiced at the return of your servant to find you had safely arrived, and that you were well. I had never heard a word from you after you left  , and a most ridiciolous story had been industerously propagated in this and the neighbouring Towns to injure the cause and blast your Reputation, viz. that you and your President had gone on board a Man of War from N-y and saild for  England. I should not mention so idle a report, but that it had given uneasiness to some of your Friends, not that they in the least credited the report, but because the Gaping vulgar swallowed the story. One man had deserted them and proved a traitor, an other might &c. I assure you such high Disputes took place in the publick house of this parish, that some men were collerd and draged out of the shop, with great Threats for reporting such scandelous lies, and an unkle of ours offerd his life as a forfeit for you if the report proved true. However it has been a nine days marvel and will now cease. I heartily wish every Tory was Extirpated   America, they are continually by secret means undermineing and injuring our cause. I am charmed with the Sentiments of Common Sense; and wonder how an honest Heart, one who wishes the welfare of their country, and the happiness of posterity can hesitate one moment at adopting them; I want to know how those Sentiments are received in Congress? I dare say their would be no difficulty in procuring a vote and instructions from all the Assemblies in  New England for . I most sincerely wish that now in the Lucky Minuet it might be done. I have been kept in a continual state of anxiety and expectation ever since you left me.  It has been said to morrow and to morrow for this month, but when the dreadfull to morrow  will be I know not -- but hark! the House this instant shakes with the roar of Cannon. I have been to the door and find tis a cannonade from our Army, orders I find are come for all the remaining Militia to repair to the Lines a monday night by twelve o clock. No Sleep for me to Night; and if I cannot who have no guilt upon my Soul with regard to this Cause, how shall the misirible wretches who have been the procurers of this Dreadfull Scene and those who are to be the actors, lie down with the load of Guilt upon their Souls. I went to Bed after 12 but got no rest, the Cannon continued firing and my Heart Beat pace with them all night. We have had a pretty quiet day, but what   to morrow will bring forth God only knows. Tolerable quiet . The Militia have all musterd with 3 days provision and are all march'd by 8 o clock this afternoon tho their notice was no longer than 8 o clock Saturday, and now we have scarcly a Man but our regular guards either in W.  [Weymouth],H.  [Hingham] or B.  [Braintree] or M.  [Milton] and the Militia from the more remote towns are call'd in as Sea coast Guards. Can you form to yourself an Idea of our Sensations. [Palmer] is chief  [Colonel],  [Bass] is Leit. [Colonel] and  [Soper] Major and Hall Captain. I have just  from   [Penn's] Hill where I have been sitting to hear the amazing roar of cannon and from whence I could see every shell which was been thrown. The sound I think is one of the Grandest in Nature and is of the true Speicies of the Sublime. Tis now an incessant Roar. But O the fatal Ideas which are connected with the sound. How many of our dear country men must fall? I went to bed about 12 and rose again a little after one. I could no more sleep than if I had been in the . The ratling of the windows, the jar of the house and the continual roar of 24 pounders, the Bursting of shells give us such Ideas, and realize a scene to us of which we could scarcly form any conception. About Six this morning, there was quiet; I rejoiced in a few hours calm. I hear we got possession of  Dorchester Hill Last Night. 4 000 thousand men upon it to day -- lost but one Man. The Ships are all drawn round the Town.To night we shall realize a more terible scene still. I sometimes think I cannot stand it -- I wish myself with you, out of the hearing as I cannot assist them. I hope to give you joy of  Boston, even if it is in ruins before I send this away. -- I am too much agitated to write as I ought, and languid for want of rest. All my anxiety, and distress, is at present at an End. I feel . This day our Militia are all returning, without effecting any thing more than taking possession of  Dorchester Hill. I hope it is wise and just, but from all the Muster and Stir I hoped and expected more important and decisive Scenes; I would not have sufferd all I have for two such Hills. Ever since the taking of that we have had a perfect calm nor can I learn yet what Effect it has had in TownBoston. I do not hear of one persons escapeing since. I was very much pleased with your  of a committe for  Canada. All those to whom I have venturd to shew that part of your Letter approve the Scheme of the Priest as a master stroke of policy. I feel sorry that  [General] Lee has left us, but his presence at  New York was no doubt of great importance as we have reason to think it prevented Clinton from landing and gathering together such a nest of virmin as would at least have distressd us greatly. But how can you spair him from there? Can you make his place good -- can you supply it with a man eaquelly qualified to save us? How do the Virginians realish the Troops said to be destined for them? Are they putting themselves into a State of Defence? I inclose to you a Coppy of a Letter sent by Capt. Furnance  [Furnass] who is in Mr. Ned Churchs imploy and who came into the  Cape about 10 days ago. You will learn the Sentiments of our Cousin by it, some of which may be true, but I hope he is a much better divine than politician. I hear in one of his Letters he mentions certain intercepted Letters which he says have made much Noise in  England, and Laments that you ever wrote them. What will he and others say to Common Sense? I cannot Bear to think of your continuing in a State of Supineness this winter.  I had  finished these lines when my Ears were again assaulted with the roar of Cannon. I could not write any further. My Hand and heart will tremble, at this domestick fury, and firce civil Strife, which cumber all our parts. Tho, Yet is not  choak chok'd, nor my Heart grown Callous. I feel for the unhappy wretches who know not where to fly for safety. I feel still more for my Bleading Country men who are hazarding their lives and their Limbs. -- A most Terible and incessant Cannonade from half after 8 till Six this morning. I hear we lost four men kill'd and some wounded in attempting to take the Hill nearest the Town call'd  Nook Hill. We did some work, but the fire from  [the ships Beat off our Men so that they did not secure it] but retired to the fort upon the other Hill. I have not got all the  I wish I had but, as I have an opportunity of sending this I shall endeavour to be more perticuliar in my next. All our Little ones send duty.  has been very sick with what is call'd the Scarlet or purple fever, but has got about again. If we have Reinforcements here, I believe we shall be driven from the sea coast, but in what so ever state I am I will  to be therewith content. You will  this very incorrect Letter. You see in what purtubation it has been written and how many times I have left of.  Adieu pray write me every opportunity.  Yours. Tooks  is the one you mention. "
"
 [Braintree] March 16 1776
","I last Evening Received yours of  March 8 . I must confess  in fault that I did not write sooner to you, but I was in continual Expectation that some important event would take place and give me a subject worth writing upon. Before this reaches you I immagine you will have Received two Letters from me; the last I closed this Day week; I since that time there has been some movements amongst the Ministerial Troops as if they meant to evacuate the Town of  Boston. Between 70 and 80 vessels of various sizes are gone down and lay in a row in fair sight of this place, all of which appear to be loaded and by what can be collected from our own observations and from deserters they have been plundering the Town. I have been very faithless with regard to their quitting Boston, and know not how to account for it, nor am I yet satisfied that they will leave it-tho it seems to be the prevailing opinion of most people; we are obliged to place the Militia upon Gaurd every Night upon the shoars thro fear of an invasion. There has been no firing since Last twesday, till about 12 o clock last Night, when I was waked out of my sleep with a smart Cannonade which continued till nine o clock this morning, and prevented any further repose for me; the occasion I have not yet heard, but before I close this Letter I may be able to give you some account of it. By the accounts in the  papers the plot thickens; and some very important Crisis seems near at hand. Perhaps providence see's it necessary in order to answer important ends and designs that the Seat of War should be changed from this to the Southeren colonies that each may have a proper sympathy for the other, and unite in a seperation. The Refuge of the Believer amidst all the afflictive dispensations of providence, is that the Lord Reigneth, and that he can restrain the Arm of Man. Orders are given to our Army to hold themselves in readiness to March at a moments warning. I'll meet you at Philippi said the Ghost of Caesar to Brutus. Being quite sick with a  cold I have tarried at Home to day; I find the fireing was occasiond by our peoples taking possession of  Nook Hill, which they kept in spite of the Cannonade, and which has really obliged our Enemy to decamp this morning on board the Transports; as I hear by a mesenger just come from Head Quarters. Some of the Select Men have been to the lines and inform that they have carried of  [every thing they could possibly] take, and what they could not they have  [burnt, broke, or hove into the water. This is I believe fact,]  many articles of good Household furniture having in the course of the week come on shore at  Great Hill, both upon this and  Weymouth Side, Lids of Desks, mahogona chairs, tables &c. Our People I hear will have Liberty to enter  Boston, those who have had the small pox. The Enemy have not yet come under sail. I cannot help suspecting some design which we do not yet comprehend; to what quarter of the World they are bound is wholy unknown, but tis generally Thought to  New york. Many people are elated with their quitting  Boston. I confess I do not feel so, tis only lifting the burden from one shoulder to the other which perhaps is less able or less willing to support it. -- To what a contemptable situation are the Troops of Britain reduced! I feel glad however that  Boston is not distroyed. I hope it will be so secured and guarded as to baffel all future attem attemps against it. -- I hear that General How said upon going upon some Eminence in Town to view our Troops who had taken  Dorchester Hill unperceived by them till sun rise, ""My God these fellows have done more work in one night than I could make my Army do in three months"" and he might well say so for in one night two forts and long Breast Works were sprung up besides several Barracks. 300 & 70 teems were imployed most of which went 3 load in the night, beside 4000 men who worked with good Hearts. From  Pens Hill we have a view of the largest Fleet ever seen in  America. You may count upwards of 100 & 70 Sail. They look like a . It was very lucky for us that we got possession of  Nook Hill. They had placed their cannon so as to fire upon the Top of the Hill where they had observed our people marking out the Ground, but it was only to elude them for they began lower upon the Hill and nearer the Town. It was a very foggy dark evening and they had possession of the Hill six hours before a gun was fired, and when they did fire they over shot our people so that they were coverd before morning and not one man lost, which the enemy no sooner discoverd than  Bunker Hill was abandoned and every Man decamp'd as soon as he could for they found they should not be able to get away if we once got our cannon mounted. Our General may say with Ceasar veni vidi et vici. What Effect does the Expectation of commisioners have with you? Are they held in disdain as they are here. It is come to that pass now that the longest sword must deside the contest -- and the sword is less dreaded here than the commisioners. You mention Threats upon . I  [know of none], nor ever heard of any till you mentiond them.  The Tories look a little crest fallen; as for Cleverly he looks like the knight of the woful countanance. I hear all the Mongrel Breed are left in  Boston -- and our pei people who were prisoners are put into Irons and carried of. As to all your own private affairs I generally avoid mentioning them to you; I take the best care I am capable of them. I have found some difficulty attending the only Man I have upon the place,  so often taking of. John and Jonathan have taken all the care in his absence, and performed very well. Bass got home very well. My Fathers horse came home in fine order and much to his satisfaction. Your own very poor. -- Cannot you hire a Servant where you are. I am sorry you are put to so much difficulty for want of one. -- I suppose you do not think one word about comeing home, and how you will get home I know not. I made a mistake in the Name of the  -- tis Tandons, instead of Took. I wish you could purchase Lord Chesterfields Letters -- I have lately heard them very highly spoken of. I smiled at your couplet of Lattin, your Daughter may be able in time to conster it as she has already made some considerable proficiency in her accidents, but her Mamma was obliged to get it translated. Pray write Lord Sterlings character. I want to know whether you live in any harmony with -- and how you setled matters. I think he seems in better humour. I think I do not admire the  from the Rostrum, tis a heavy unelegant, verbose performance and did not strike my fancy at all. I am very sausy suppose you will say. Tis a Liberty I take with you; indulgance is apt to spoil one. Adieu --  Yours most Sincerely. P.S.Pray convey me a little paper. I have but enough for one Letter more. A fine quiet night -- no  no Cannon. The more I think of our Enemies quitting  Boston, the more amaz'd I am, that they should leave such a harbour, such fortifications, such intrenchments, and that we should be in peaceable possession of a Town which we expected would cost us a river of Blood without one Drop shed. Shurely it is the Lords doings and it is Marvelous in our Eyes. Every foot of Ground which they obtain now they must fight for, and  [may they purchase it at a  Bunker Hill price.]  "
"Braintree  March 31, 1776
","I wish you would ever write me a Letter half as long as I write you; and tell me if you may where your Fleet are gone? What sort of   Virginia can make against our common Enemy? Whether it is so situated as to make an able Defence? Are not the Gentery Lords and the common people vassals, are they not like the uncivilized Natives  Brittain represents us to be? I hope their Riffel Men who have shewen themselves very savage and even Blood thirsty; are not a specimen of the Generality of the people. I   am willing to allow the Colony great merrit for having produced a Washington but they have been shamefully duped by a Dunmore. I have sometimes been ready to think that the passion for Liberty cannot be  Strong in the Breasts of those who have been accustomed to deprive their fellow Creatures of theirs. Of this I am certain that it is not founded upon that generous and christian principal of doing to others as we would that others should do unto us. Do not you want to see  Boston; I am  of the small pox, or I should have been in before this time. I got Mr. Crane to go to our House and see what state it was in. I find it has been occupied by one of the Doctors of a Regiment, very dirty, but no other damage has been done to it. The few things which were left in it are all gone. Cranch has the key which he never deliverd up. I have wrote to him for it and am determined to get it cleand as soon as possible and shut it up. I look upon it a new acquisition of property, a property which one month ago I did not value at a single Shilling, and could with pleasure have seen it in flames. The Town in General is left in a better state than we expected, more  to a percipitate flight than any Regard to the inhabitants, tho some individuals discoverd a sense of honour and justice and have left the rent of the Houses in which they were, for the owners and the furniture unhurt, or if damaged sufficent to make it good. Others have committed abominable Ravages. The Mansion House of your  is safe and the furniture unhurt whilst both  the House and Furniture of the Solisiter General have fallen a prey to their own merciless party. Surely the very Fiends feel a Reverential awe for Virtue and patriotism, whilst they Detest the paricide and traitor. I feel very differently at the approach of spring to what I did a month ago. We knew not then whether we could plant or sow with safety, whether when we had  we could reap the fruits of our own industery, whether we could rest in our own Cottages, or whether we should not be driven from the sea coasts to seek shelter in the wilderness, but now we feel as if we might sit under our own vine and eat the good of the land. I feel a gaieti de Coar to which before I was a stranger. I think the Sun looks brighter, the Birds sing more melodiously, and Nature puts on a more  countanance. We feel a temporary peace, and the poor fugitives are returning to their deserted habitations.  we felicitate ourselves, we sympathize with those who are trembling least the Lot of  Boston should be theirs. But they cannot be in similar circumstances unless pusilanimity and cowardise should take possession of them. They have time and warning given them to see the Evil and shun it. -- I long to hear that you have declared an independency -- and by the way in the new Code of Laws which I suppose it will be necessary for you to make I desire you would Remember the Ladies, and be more generous and favourable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the Husbands. Remember all Men would be tyrants if they could. If perticuliar care and attention is not paid to the Laidies we are determined to foment a Rebelion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any Laws in which we have no voice, or Representation. That your Sex are Naturally Tyrannical is a Truth so thoroughly established as to admit of no dispute, but such of you as wish to be happy willingly give up the harsh title of Master for the more tender and endearing one of Friend. Why then, not put it out of the power of the vicious and the  Lawless to use us with cruelty and indignity with impunity. Men of Sense in all Ages abhor those customs which treat us only as the vassals of your Sex. Regard us then as Beings placed by providence under your protection and in immitation of the Supreem Being make use of that power only for our happiness. Not having an opportunity of sending this I shall add a few lines more;  not with a heart so gay. I have been attending the sick chamber of our Neighbour Trot whose affliction I most sensibly feel but cannot discribe, striped of two lovely children in one week. Gorge the Eldest died on wedensday and Billy the youngest on fryday, with the Canker fever, a terible disorder so much like the throat distemper, that it differs but little from it. Betsy Cranch has been very bad, but upon the recovery. Becky Peck they do not expect will live out the day. Many grown persons are now sick with it, in this street 5. It rages much in other Towns. The Mumps too are very frequent. Isaac is now confined with it. Our own little flock are yet well. My Heart trembles with anxiety for them. God preserve them. I want to hear much oftener from you than I do.  March 8  was the last date of any that I have yet had. -- You inquire of whether I am making Salt peter. I have not yet attempted it, but after Soap making believe I shall make the experiment. I find as much as I can do to manufacture  for my family whowhich would else be Naked. I know of but one person in this part of the Town who has made any, that is Mr. Tertias Bass as he is calld who has got very near an hundred weight which has been found to be very good. I have heard of some others in the other parishes. Mr. Reed of Weymouth has been applied to, to go to  Andover to the mills which are now at work, and has gone. I have lately seen a small Manuscrip describing the proportions for the various sorts of powder,such asfit for cannon, small arms and pistols  [illegible]  . If it would be of any Service your way I will get it transcribed and send it to you. -- Every one of your Friends send their Regards, and all the little ones. Your Brothers youngest child lies bad with convulsion fitts.  Adieu. I need not say how much I am Your ever faithfull Friend.  "
April 7 1776,"I Received two Letters from you this week one of the 13  and the other the  19 of March . I know not where one of my Letters is gone, unless you have since Received it. I certainly wrote you in Febry. and the first Letter I wrote I mention that I had not wrote before. I have write four Letters before this. Believe I have Received all yours Except one you mention writing from Framingham which I never heard of before. Have Received all the papers you sent, the oration and . In the small papers I some times find peices begun and continued, (for instance Johnstones Speach) but am so unlucky as not to get the papers in order and miss of seeing the whole. The Removal of the Army  to have stoped the current of news. I want to know to what part of America they are now wandering. Tis Reported and creditted that Manly has taken a schooner belonging to the Fleet richly Laden with money, plate and english Goods with a Number of Tories. The particuliars have not yet Learnt. Yesterday the Remains of our Worthy General Warren were dug up upon  Bunker Hill and carried into Town and on monday are to be interred with all the  of War. The Dr. was Buried on monday the Masons walking in procession from the State House, with the Military in uniforms and a large concourse of people attending. He was carried into the , and their a funirel Dirge was played, an Excellent prayer by Dr. Cooper, and an oration by Mr. Morton which I hope will be printed. I think the Subject must have inspired him, a young fellow could not have wished a finer opportunity to have displayed his talents. The amiable and heroick virtues of the disceased resent recent in the minds of the Audience, the noble cause to which he fell a Martir, their own Sufferings and unparrelled injuries all fresh in their minds, must give weight and energy to whatever could be deliverd upon the occasion, the Dead Body like that of Caesars before their Eyes, whilst each wound, ""like dumb mouths wounds did ope their ruby lips, and beg the voice and utterance of a Tongue."" "
April 14 1776,"I have misst my Good Friend Col. from  Watertown in the conveyance of my Letters; you make no mention of more than one, write me how many you have had and what the dates were. I wrote you upon the  17 of March . Perticuliars it was not then posible to obtain; and after that I thought every pen would be imployed in writing to you a much more accurate account than I could give you. The Fleet lay in the Road  a fortnight after the Town was evacuated; in that time Major Tuper came with a Body of Men to   [Germantown] and procured two Lighters, (one of them was that of which you are part owner) and fitted them with every sort of combustable Matters, Hand Grenades &c. in order to set fire to the Fleet, but the very day he was ready they saild and it was said that they had inteligence from  Boston of the design. However he carried the Lighters up to Town for the next Fleet that appears. Fort Hill is a fortifying I suppose in the best Manner, committes have been appointed to survey the Islands &c. but we are scanty of Men,  said we have not more than 2000 Effective Men left, and the General thought it necessary to take the Heavy cannon with him. We have many peices spiked up which they are imployed in cleaning, about an 100 peices I have heard was left at the Castle with their trunnels broke or spiked. The Castle you have no doubt heard was burnt by the Troops before they saild, and an attempt made to blow up the walls in which however they did not succeed any further than to shatter them. There are so many things necessary to be done that I suppose  moves slowly. At present we all seem to be so happy and so tranquil, that I sometimes think we want another Fleet to give some energy and spirit to our motions. But there has been a great overturn and people seem to be hardly recoverd from their amazement. Many Buildings in Town sustaind great damages more perticuliarly at the South end, the Furniture of many houses was carried of or broken in peices. Dr. Gardiner left all his furniture and Medicine valued tis said at 400 Sterling. Dr. Loyd is still in Town,Dr. Whitworth too, both ought to be transported. Mr. Goldwait  [is] in Town  [and] all the Records of which he had the care safe, tho it seems part of them were carried into Boston. All the papers relating to the  probate courts are missing.Mr. Lovel and all the prisoners taken at the  Charlstown  Battle are carried of. The Bells are all in Town, never were taken down. The officers and Tories have lived a life of Dissipation. Inclosed is a prologue of Burgoines, with a parody written in  Boston soon after it was acted. -- Burgoine is a Better poet than war Soldier. As to goods of any kind, we cannot tell what quantity there is. Only two or three Shops open. Goods at a most extravagant price -- all the better to promote Manufactures. The small pox prevents my going to Town; several have broke out with it in the Army since they went into  Boston. I cannot help wishing that it would spread. I think the Country is in more danger than ever. I am anxious about it. If it should spread there is but one thing would prevent my going down to our own House and having it with all our children and I dont know but I should be tempted to run you in debt for it. There is talk of raising  Regiment. If they should I fear we shall suffer in our Husbandery. Labour is very high. I cannot hire a Man for six months under 20 pounds Lawfull money. The Works upon the Neck are . We keep Guards upon the Shoars yet. --Manly has taken a vessel Load of Tories. Among them is Black the Scotchman and Brasen head Jackson, Hill the Baker &c. What can be done with them. I think they ought to be transported to  England. I would advertize for tory transports. Hanover has made large quantities of salt peter. This week we are  hold court here, but I do not imagine any thing will be done. I have a Letter from you the  29 of March . Tis said there is one from Mr. Gerry the 3 of April acquainting us with your opening trade. Who is the writer of Common Sense, of Cato, of Casandra? I wish you would according to promise write me an account of Lord Sterling. We know nothing about him here. All the Tories look crest fallen. Several deserters from on board the commodore's ship say that  very sickly on board. We have only that and two or 3 cutters  besides. We fear that a Brig laiden with 70 tons of powder which saild from  Newbury port has fallen into the enemys hands upon her return. Pray continue to write me by every opportunity, the writing Books were very acceptable presents. I rejoice in the Southern . The oration was a very elegant performance, but not without much Art -- a few Strokes which to me injure the performance.  "
April 18 1776,"I cannot omit so good an opportunity as offers by Mr. Church of telling you that we are all well. I wrote you two Letters last week which I sent to  Watertown. In those I said every thing that  to my mind, nothing since of any importance has taken place. The 19 of April (ever memorable for  America as the Ides of March to Rome and to Ceasar) is fixd upon for the trial examination of the Tories by a committee from the General Court. I could have wished that some other persons, in the Room of one or two might have been chosen. It is so dangerous mentioning Names that I refer you to Mr. Church for the Names of the committe, and then you will easily guess who I mean. I wish I could tell you that  in the Fortification way went on Briskly, but a Western Member in the General Court who has great influence there, has got it into his Head that  Fort Hill and  Noddles Island are sufficent and tho a Man possessd of a very good Heart, is sometimes obstinately wrong. The Court of Sessions set yesterday and went on with  very smoothly. We hear that Congress has declared a free trade, and I give you joy of the Success of Admiral Hopkins, not only in his Expedition, but in his Success upon his return.  Great  I think is not quite omnipotent at Sea, any more than upon the land. You promised to come and see me in May or . Shall I Expect you, or do you determine to stay out the year? I very well remember when the Eastern circuts of the courts which lasted a month were thought an age, and an absence of 3 months intolerable but we are carried from Step to Step, and from one degree to an other to endure that which at first we think insuportable. But I assure you I am obliged to make use of Reason and  in addition to custom to feel patient. Be assured I always Remember you as I ought, that is with the tenderest affection, Yours.   "
April 21 1776,"I have to  the Recept of a very few lines dated the 12 of April . You make no mention of the whole sheets I have wrote to you, by which I judge you either never Received them, or that they were so lengthy as to be troublesome; and in return you have set me an example of being very concise. I believe I shall not take the Hint, but give as I love to Receive; Mr. Church talk'd a week ago of setting of for  Philadelphia. I wrote by him; but suppose it is not yet gone; you have perhaps heard that the Bench is fill'd by Mr. Foster and Sullivan, so that a certain person is now excluded. I own I am not of so forgiveing a disposition as to wish to see him holding a place which he refused merely from a spirit of envy. I give up my Request for Chesterfields Letters submitting  to your judgment, as I have ever found you ready to oblige me in this way whenever you thought it would contribute either to my entertainment or improvement. I was led to the request from reading the following character of him in my favorite Thomson and from some spiritted and patriotick speaches of his in the Reign of Gorge 2. I think the Speculations you  prove that there is full Liberty of the press. Cato shews he has a bad cause to defend whilst the Forester writes with a spirit peculiar to himself and leads me to think that he has an intimate acquaintance with Common Sense. We have  of the Arrival of some of the Tory Fleet at  Halifax that they are much distresst for want of Houses, obliged to give 6 Dollors per month for one Room, provisions scarce and dear. Some women Some of them with 6 or 8 children round them sitting upon the Rocks crying, not knowing where to lay their heads. Just Heaven has given them to taste of the same cup of Afliction which they one year ago administerd with such Callous Hearts to their thousand citizens thousands of their fellow citizens, but with this difference that they fly from their injured and enraged Country, whilst, pity and commiseration received the Sufferers whom they inhumanely drove of from their Dwellings. I would fain hope that  time may not be far distant when those things you hint at may be carried into Execution. Tis reported here that Admiral Hopkings is blocked up in  Newport  by a Number of Men of War. If so tis a very unlucky circumstance. As to fortification those who preside in the assembly can give you a much better account than I. I heard yesterday that a Number of Gentlemen who were together at  Cambridge thought it highly proper that a  Committee of Ladies should be chosen to examine the Torys Ladies, and proceeded to the choise of 3 Mrs. Winthrope, Mrs. Warren and your Humble Servant. I could go on and give you a long list of  affairs, but they would only serve to embariss you, and noways relieve me. I hope it will not be long before things will be brought into such a train as that you may be spaired to your family. Your Brother has lost his youngest child with convulsion fits. Your Mother is well and always desires to be  to you. Nabby is sick with the mumps, a very disagreable disorder. -- You have not once told me how you do. I judge you are well as you seem to be in Good Spirits. -- I bid you good Night, all the Little flock Send Duty; and want to see P--a.  Adieu. Shall I say remember me as ought. "
"
 [Braintree] May 7, 1776
","How many are the solitary hours I spend, ruminating upon the past, and anticipating the future, whilst you  with the cares of State, have but few moments you can devote to any individual. All domestick pleasures and injoyments are absorbed in the great and important duty you owe your Country ""for our Country is as it were a secondary God, and the First and greatest parent. It is to be preferred to Parents, Wives, Children, Friends and all things the Gods only excepted. For if our Country perishes it is as imposible to save an Individual, as to preserve one of the fingers of a Mortified Hand."" Thus do I supress every wish, and silence every Murmer, acquiesceing in a painfull Seperation from the companion of my youth, and the Friend of my Heart. I believe  near ten days since I wrote you a line. I have not felt in a humour to entertain you. If I had taken up my pen perhaps some unbecomeing invective might have fallen from it; the Eyes of our Rulers have been closed and a Lethargy has seazd almost every Member. I fear a fatal Security has taken possession of them.  [illegible]   Whilst the Building is on flame they tremble at the expence of water to quench it, in short two months has elapsed since the evacuation of  Boston, and very little has been done in that time to secure it, or the Harbour from future invasion till the people are all in a flame; and no one among us that I have heard of even mentions expence, they think universally that there has been an amaizing neglect some where. Many have turnd out as volunteers to work upon Nodles Island, and many more would go upon  Nantaskit if it was once set on foot. ""Tis a Maxim of state That power and Liberty are like Heat and moisture; where they are well mixt every thing prospers, where they are single, they are destructive."" A  of more Stability is much wanted in this colony, and they are ready to receive them it from the Hands of the Congress, and since I have begun with Maxims of State I will add an other viz. that a people may let a king fall, yet still remain a people, but if a king let his people slip from him, he is no longer a king. And as this is most certainly our case, why not proclaim to the World in decisive terms your own importance? Shall we not be  by foreign powers for hesitateing so long at a word? I can not say that I think you very generous to the Ladies, for whilst you are proclaiming peace and good will to Men, Emancipating all Nations, you insist upon  retaining an absolute power over Wives. But you must remember that Arbitary power is like most other things which are very hard, very liable to be broken -- and notwithstanding all your wise Laws and Maxims we have it in our power not only to free ourselves but to subdue our Masters, and without voilence throw both your natural and legal authority at our feet I thank you for several Letters which I have received since I wrote Last. They alleviate a tedious absence, and I long earnestly for a Saturday Evening, and experience a similar pleasure to that which I used to  find in the return of my Friend upon that day after a weeks absence. The Idea of a year dissolves all my Phylosophy. Our Little ones whom you so often recommend to my care and instruction shall not be deficient in virtue or probity if the precepts of a Mother have their desired Effect, but  would be doubly inforced could they be indulged with the example of a Father constantly before them; I often point them to their Sire I  to have finished the sheet, but an opportunity offering I close only just inform you that May the 7 our privateers took two prises in the Bay in fair sight of the Man of war, one a Brig from Irland the other from fyall loaded with wine Brandy and the other Beaf &c. The wind was East and a flood tide, so that the tenders could not get out tho they tried several times, the Light house fired Signal guns, but all would not do, they took them in triumph and carried them into  Lyn.  and Charls have the Mumps, a bad disorder, but they are not very bad.  Pray be kind enough to remember me at all times and write as often as you possibly can to your  Portia  "
May 9 1776,"I this day Received yours of the 20 of April   accompanied with a Letter upon Goverment. Upon reading it I some how or other felt an uncommon affection for it; I could not help thinking it was a near relation of a very intimate Friend of mine. If I am mistaken in its descent, I know it has a near affinity to the Sentiments of that person, and tho I cannot pretend to be an adept in the art of Goverment; yet it looks rational that a Goverment of Good Laws well administerd should carry with at them the fairest prospect of happiness to a community, as well as to individuals. But as this is a perogative to which your Sex lay almost an exclusive claim I shall quit the subject after having quoted a passage in favour of a Republic from an anonymous author intittled Essays on the Genius and Writings of Pope. ""The fine arts, in short are naturally attendant upon power and luxury, but the Sciences require unlimited freedom to raise them to their full Vigour and Growth. In a Monarchy there may be poets, painters and Musicians, but orators, Historians and phylosophers can exist in a Republic alone. The Roman Nation by their unjust attempt upon the Liberty of the World, justly lost their own, and with their Liberty they lost not only their force of Eloquence, but even their Stile and Language itself."" This province is not in the most  situation at present, it wants a poize, a stability which it does not possess. The Counsel have recommended it to the Superior Court to sit at  Ipswich the next Term. Judge Cushing called upon me yesterday with his Lady and made me a very Friendly visit. Said he wish'd earnestly for the presence of the Chief justice, he had many things he wished to say to him. I requested him to write, and he has promised to. The Spirit of fortification has just awaked, and we are now persuing .with  what ought before this time to have been compleated.  Fort Hill,  the Castle,  Dorchester point,  Nodles Island are allmost compleated, a committe are sent down to  Nantasket, and orders are given to fortify the  Moon,  Gorges Island &c. I believe  Nodles Island has been done by Subscription. 6 hundred meet every morning, inhabitants of the Town of  Boston, in the Town house from whence they March with fife and drum with Mr. Gorden, Mr. Skilman and Mr. Lothtrope at their head to the  long Wharf where they embark for the Island, and it comes to the Subscribers turn to work 2 days in a week. You have no doubt heard of the appointment of your Friend as judge. He seems  to accept, and his Lady I think loth that he should; surely it does not look well to have those offices banded about from hand to hand. If they could not obtain one from the bar, that Gentleman will fill the place with honour to himself and his Breatheren. But Mr.  [Lowell] ought to have come in, instead of some others, but there are some in  [Council] who require more than Heaven, that demands only repentance and amendmant. Let me hear from you often.  Yours unfeignedly.  "
"May 14, 1776","I set down to write you a Letter Domestick without one word of politicks or any thing of the Kind, and tho you may have matters of infinately more importance before you, yet let it come as a relaxation to you. Know then that we have had a very cold backward Spring, till about ten days past when every thing looks finely. We have had fine Spring rains which makes the Husbandary promise fair -- but the great difficulty has been to procure Labourers. There is such a demand of Men from the publick and such a price given that the farmer who Hires must be greatly out of pocket. A man will not talk with you who is worth hireing under 24 pounds per year. Col. Quincy and Thayer give that price, and some give more. Isaac insisted upon my giving him 20 pounds or he would leave me. He is no mower and I found very unfit to take the lead upon the Farm, having no forethought or any contrivance to plan his Buisness, tho in the Execution faithfull. I found I wanted somebody of Spirit who was wiser than myself, to conduct my Buisness. I went about and my Friends inquired but every Labourer who was active was gone and going into the Service. I asked advice of my Friends and Neighbours  [and] they all adviced me to let Isaac go, rather than give that price. I setled with him and we parted. Mr. Belcher is now with me and has undertaken to conduct the Buisness, which he has hitherto done with Spirit and activity. I know his virtues I know his faults. Hithertoo I give him 2 Shillings per day, and Daniel Nightingale works with him at the same lay. I would have hired him for the season but he was engaged to look after a place or two for people who are gone into the Army. I am still in quest of a Man by the year, but whether I shall effect it, I know not. I have done the best I could. We are just now ready to plant, the barly looks charmingly, I shall be quite a Farmeriss an other year. You made no  agreement with Isaac so he insisted upon my paying him 13. 6 8. I paid him 12 pounds 18 & 8 pence, and thought it sufficient. When Bass  he brought me some Money from you. After the deduction of his account and the horse hire there remaind 15 pounds. I have Received 12 from Mr. Thaxter which with one note of 20 pounds which I exchanged and some small matters of interest which I received and a little Hay &c. I have discharged the following debts -- To my Father for his Horse twice 12 pounds (he would not have any thing for the last time). To Bracket, 13. 6s. 8d. To Isaac 12. 18. 8. To Mr. Hunt for the House 26. 15. 4. and the Rates of two years 1774, 4 14s. 8d. and for 1775: 7. 11s. 11d. Besides this have supported the family which is no small one you know and paid all little charges which will have occurd in the farming way. I hardly know how I have got thro these thing's, but it gives me great pleasure to say they are done because I know it will be an Ease to your mind which amid all other cares which surround you will some times advert to your own Little Farm and to your Family. There remains due to Mr. Hunt about 42 pounds. I determine if it lays in my power to discharge the bond, and I have some prospect of it. Our Little Flock send duty. I called them  and told them Pappa wanted to send them something and requested of them what they would have. A Book was the answer of them all only Tom wanted a picture Book and Charlss the History of king and Queen. It was natural for them to think of a Book as that is the only present they ever Pappa has been used to make them.  "
" [Braintree,  27 May 1776]","What can be the reason I have not heard from you since the 20 of April, and now  the 27 of May. My anxious foreboding Heart fears every Evil, and my Nightly Slumbers are tortured; I have sent, and sent again to the post office, which is now kept in  Boston at the office of the formour Solisiter General, not one line for me,tho your hand writing is to be seen to several others. Not a scrip have I had since the General Assembly rose, and our Worthy Friend  [Warren] left  Watertown. I fear you are sick. The very Idea casts such a Gloom upon my Spirits that I cannot recover them for Hours, nor reason my self out of my fears. Surely if Letters are deliverd to any other hand than those to whose care they are directed tis cruel to detain them. I believe for the future you had better direct them to be left in the post office from whence I shall be sure of obtaining them. I am desired by Sister A -- s   to ask you if you will take 28 acres of wood land which she mentiond to you. It must be sold, has a very fine Growth of Walnut wood upon it, as well as other wood,tis prized at forty shillings per acker acre which by looking into his deed of it, I find to be the same he gave for it. The distance which it lies from us is the chief objection in my mind. You will be so good as to send me word as soon as you Receive this. They are about setling the Estate as soon as posible. What can be done with, or about the Lighter I know not. I was told that she was taken for a fire ship, but was Misinformed. There is no regular account of any thing but the ropes, cable and sails, nor any thing which appears to shew the cost of her. I think it can only be left to those who Built about that time to say what they believe she cost. They have prized one half of her very Low 33. 8. 4. I have asked my unkle  [Quincy] to assist in your stead. The watch she says you desired to have. I know nothing about it; not having heard you mention it. She sits it at 6 pounds. I wrote you two Letters about a fortnight ago which were both  together, hope you have received them. We have no News here but what you will be informd of long before this reaches you unless it is the politicks of the Town. At our May Meeting Mr.  [Wibird] was desired to preach a Sermon previous to the choise which he did to great acceptation. The debates were not who; but how many should be sent. They agreed upon 3 -- Mr. Bass for the upper precicnt,Col. [Thayer] for the middle and an unkel of ours for this, but he beg'd to be excused, as his State of Health was so infirm and so subject to a nervious headack that he was sure he could not stand it to sit in so numerous an assembly.  The next vote was for your Brother and a tye took place between him and Col.  [Palmer] but the Latter declairing that he would tarry in the house if chosen there, the vote fell upon him . The  News we have from  Quebeck is a great damper to our Spirits, but shall we receive good and not Evil? Upon this occasion you will recollect the Sentiments of your favorite Sully. Without attempting to judge of the future, which depends upon too many accidents, much less to subject it to our precipitation in bold and difficult enterprizes, we should endeavour to subdue one obstacle at a time, nor suffer ourselves to be deprest by their Greatness and their Number. We ought never to despair of what has been once accomplished. How many things have the Idea of imposible been  [illegible]   annexed to, that have become easy to those who knew how to take advantage of Time, opportunity, lucky Moments, the Faults of others, different dispositions and an infinite Number of other circumstances. These are Sentiments worthy the Man who could Execute what he . I sincerely wish we should had the Spirit of Sully animateing our counsells counsels. My Heart is as light as a feather and my Spirits are dancing. I received this afternoon a fine parcel of Letters and papers by  Thayer, it was a feast to me. I shall rest in quiet I hope this Night; the papers I have not read but sit down to write you for Mr. Bass has just been here to let me know that Harry will call upon him to-morrow and take this Letter for me. I would not have you  [illegible]   anxious about me. I make out better than I did. I have hired a Negro fellow for 6 months, am to give him ten pounds which is much lower than I had any prospect of getting help, and Belcher is exceeding assiduous and I believe faithfull in what he undertakes. If he should purloin a little I must bear that; he is very diligent, and being chief engineer is ambitious. If you could find a few moments leisure just to write him a few lines and let him know that I had wrote you that he had the care of the place, and that you should be glad of his best Services upon it, of his constant care and attention I believe it would go a good way towards insureing it. -- You will find by one of the Letters which I mention as having sent an account of some of your affairs. My best endeavours will not be wanting in every  department. I wish my abilities were eaquel to my wishes. My Father and your Mother desire to be  to you in very perticuliar terms. The family you mention are well. So is your Brothers, your own are tolerably comfortable. Charls has the Mumps and has been very sick but is now better. Can you tell how I feel when they come to me as they the two youngest often do, with a Mar, when will par come home?  Grandmama tells this Story of Him. She was carrying him to meeting the Sabbeth the Regulars left  Boston when a person stop'd her upon the road to tell her the news. Gone from  Boston says he with his Eyes just ready to run over. What gone away themselves. Yes replied his Grandmamma. Then I say they are Cowards, for they have stood it but one year and we would have stood it 3. I took a ride last week and ventured just as far as the Stump of Liberty Tree.  Roxbury looks more injured than  Boston, that is the Houses look more torn to . I was astonished at the extensiveness of our lines and their strength. You We have taken a most noble prize the inventory of which you have in the paper. The poor Captain has since lost his life in a desperate ingagement with 13 Boats from the Men of War which attacked him and attempted to Board him, but by a most brave resistance they sunk four of the Boats and fought so warmly with their spears and small Arms as to oblige them to quit him, tho he had but 27 men and they 5 times his number. He unhappily fell and was the only one who did. Many dead bodies have since been taken up among whom is an officer. -- We have now in fair sight of my unkells the commodore, a 36 Gun frigate, an other large vessel and 6 small craft. I hope after Election we shall have ways and means devised to drive of these Torments. Providence seems to have deliverd into our Hands the very articles most needed, and at a time when we were weak and not so well provided for as we could wish. We have two Row Gallies Building, and Men of Spirit to use them I dare say will be found. One engagement only whets their appetite for an other. I heard last Night that we had 3 Regiments comeing back to us with General Gates to head them, at which I most sincerely rejoiced. I think he is the Man we want. Believe you may venture Letters safely by the Post. Mine go that way, and for the future I will send to the post office for yours. You ask my advice with regard to your office. If I was to consult only my own private Satisfaction and pleasure I should request you to resign it, but as that is of small moment when  to the whole, and I think you qualified and know you disposed to serve your Country I must advice you to hold it, at least for the present year. And in saying this I make a Sacrifice which those only can judge of whose Hearts are one. I was much affected the other day with a Letter which I saw from the Lady of the late worthy General Montgomery. Speaking of him, she says, suffer me to repeat his last words to me; you shall never Blush for your Montgomery. Nobly has he kept his Word. As a wife I must ever mourn the Husband, Friend and Lover of a thousand virtues, of all  Bliss, the Idol of my warmest affections and in one word my every dream of happiness. Methinks I am like the poor widow in the Gosple, having given my Mite, I sit down disconsolate. These are only detached parts of the Letter to which I fear I have not done justice, as I have only my memory to serve me, but it was a very fine Letter. Our Worthy Friends are in great trouble, their eldest Son  is disorderd in his mind.? I have not had a line since he was carried home, and I know not the cause. I want to hear from them, but know not how to write to them. I  bid you good night. O that I could annihilate Space. Yours. You have been . The Regulars have not made any fortifications any where. It was so reported but was not true. "
June 3. 1776,"I received by Mr. Church a few lines from you; I wish to hear from you every opportunity  you say no more than that you are well. I feel concernd least your cloaths should go to rags having nobody to take any care of you in your long absence, and then you have not with you a proper change for the Seasons. However you must do the best you can. I have a suit of homespun for you whenever you return. I cannot avoid sometimes repineing that the gifts of fortune were not bestowed upon us, that I might have injoyed the happiness of spending my days with my Partner. But as it is, I think it my duty to attend with frugality and oeconomy to our own private affairs, and if I cannot add to our Little Substance yet see that it is not diminished. I should enjoy but little comfort in a state of Idleness, and uselessness. Here I can serve my partner, my family and myself, and injoy the Satisfaction of your serving your Country.  I wish you would write me what I had best do with our House at  Boston. I would advertise it if you think best. There are so many Houses torn to  and so many others abused that I might stand a chance of Letting it perhaps as it is in so good repair. My Brother is desirous of joining the Army again  but would chuse to be a field officer. I have mentiond him to some of the House and suppose he will be recommended to congress, for a commission. I hardly know where you will find Men to form the Regiments required. I begin to think population a very important Branch in the American Manufactorys. I enclose a List of Counsel. The House consists of more than 200 & 50 Members. Your former pupil  comes from  Bridgwater, and 5 others. I hope they will proceed in Buisness with a little more Spirit than Heretofore. They are procuring two row Gallies, but when they will be finished I know not. I thought they were near done, but find to day they are not yet contracted for. All our Gentery are gone from  Nantasket road except the commodore and one or two small craft. Every thing bears a very great price. The Merchant complains of the Farmer and the Farmer of the Merchant. Both are extravagant. Living is double what it was one year ago. I find you have  Tea but I am determined not to be a purchaser unless I can have it at Congress price, and in that article the venders pay no regard to congress, asking 10. 8. and the lowest is 7.6 per pound. I should like a little Green, but they say there is none to be had here; I only wish it for a medicine, as a relief to a nervious pain in my Head to which I am sometimes subject. Were it as plenty as ever  I would not practice the use of it. Our Family are all well. It has been reported here that congress were going to remove 40 miles beyond  Philadelphia. I gave no credit to the report, I heard no reason  for it. I had much rather they would come a hundred miles nearer home here.  "
"
Plimouth June 17  [1776] a remarkable Day
","I this day Received by the Hands of our Worthy Friend a large packet, which has refreshed and comforted me. Your own sensations have ever been similar to mine. I need  then tell you how gratified I am at the frequent tokens of remembrance with which you favour me, nor how they rouse every tender sensation of my Soul, which sometimes find vent at my Eyes nor dare I discribe how earnestly I long to fold to my fluttering Heart the dear object of my warmest affections. The Idea sooths me, I feast upon it with a pleasure known only to those whose Hearts and hopes are one. The approbation you give to my conduct in the Management of our private affairs is very  to me and sufficently compensates, for all my anxieties, and endeavours to discharge the many duties devolved upon me in consequence of the absence of my dearest Friend. Were they discharged eaquel to my wishes I should merrit the praises you bestow. You see I date from  . Here I came upon a visit to our amiable Friends accompanied by My Sister Betsy a day or two ago, and is the first night I have been absent since you left me. Having determined upon this visit for some time, I put my Family in order and prepaird for it, thinking I might leave it with safety. Yet the day I set out I was under many apprehensions by the comeing in of ten Transports who were seen to have many Soldiers on board, and the determination of the people to go and fortify upon  Long Island,  Peticks Is land,  Nantasket and  Great Hill. It was apprehended they would attempt to land some where, but the next morning I had the pleasure to hear they were all driven out, Commodore and all. Not a Transport, a Ship or a tender to be seen. This shews what might have been long ago done. Had this been done in season the ten Transports with many others in all probability would have fallen into our Hands, but the progress of wisdom is slow. Since I arrived here, I have really had a scene quite novel to me. The Brig  from  Connecticut put in here for Balist. The officers who are all from thence and who were intimately acquainted at Dr. Lorthropes, invited his Lady to come on board and bring with her as many of her Friends as she could collect. She sent an invitation to our Friend Mrs. [Warren] and to us. The brig lay about a mile and half from the Town, the officers sent their Barge and we went, every mark of Respect and attention which they was in their power, they shewd us.  She is a fine Brigg, Mounts 16 Guns, 12 Swivells and carries 100 & 20 men. 100 & seventeen were on board; and no private family ever appeard under better Regulation than the Crew. It was as still as tho there had been only half a dozen, not a prophane word among any of them. The Captain himself is an exemplary Man,Harden his name, has been in nine Sea engagements, says if he gets a Man who swears and finds he cannot reform him he turns him on shoar, Yet is free to confess that it was the sin of his youth. He has one lieutenant a very fine fellow,Smelden by name. We spent a very agreable afternoon and drank tea on board, they shew'd us their Arms which were sent by Queen Ann, and every thing on board was a curiosity to me. They gave us a mock engagement with an Enemy, and the manner of taking a ship. The young folks went upon Quarter deck and danced. Some of their jacks played very well upon the voilene and German flute. The Brig bears the continental Colours and was fitted out by the Colony of  Connecticut. As we set of from the Brig they fired their Guns in honour to us, a ceremony I would have very readily dispenced with. I  you and feel for you under all the difficulties you have to encounter. My daily petitions to Heaven for you, are, that you may have Health, Wisdom and fortitude sufficent to carry you thro the great, and arduous Buisness in which you are engaged; and that your endeavours may be crownd with success. -- Canady seems a dangerous and ill fated place. It is reported here that General Thomas is no more, that he took the small pox and died with it. Every day some circumstance arises and shews me the importance of having that distemper in youth. Dr. Bulfinch has petitiond the General Court for leave to open a Hospital some where, and it will be granted him. I shall with all the children be one of the first class you may depend upon it. I have just this moment heard that the Brig on which I was on board a Saturday and which  yesterday morning from this place fell in with two Transports having each of them a l00 & 50 Men on board and took them and has brought them into  Nantasket road, under cover of the Guns which are mounted there. Will add further perticuliars as soon as I am informd. I am now better  and can give you the Truth. The Brig Defence, accompanied by a smaller privateer saild in concert a Sunday morning. About 12 o clock they discoverd two Transports, and made for them. Two privateers who  were small had been in chase of them, but finding the enemy were of much larger force; had run under Cohasat Rocks. The Defence gave a Signal Gun to bring them out.Capt. Burk who accompanied the Defence being a prime Sailor came up first and pourd a Broad Side on board a 16 Gun Brig. The Defence soon attack'd her upon her Bows, an obstinate engagement ensued, their was a continual Blaze upon all sides for many Hours and it was near mid Night before they struck. In the engagement the Defence lost one Man and 5 wounded. On board Burk not one Man received any damage. On board the enemy 14 killd among whom was a Major and 60 wounded. They are part of the Hiland Soldiers. The other Transport mounted 6 Guns. When the Fleet saild out of this Harbour last week they blew up the light House. They met 6 Transports comeing in which they carried of with them. Hope we shall soon be in such a posture of defence as to bid them defiance. I feel no great anxiety at the large designd against us. The remarkable interpositions of Heaven in our favour cannot be too gratefully acknowledged. He who fed the Isralites in the wilderness, who cloaths the lilies of the Field and feeds the young Ravens when they cry, will not forsake a people engaged in so righteous cause if we remember his Loving kindness. We wanted powder, we have a Supply. We wanted guns, we have been  in that respect. We wanted hard money, 22000 Dollors and an Eaquel value of plate are deliverd into our Hands. You mention your peas, your cherries, your strawberries &c. Ours are but just in . We have had the coldest Spring I ever knew, things are 3 weeks back of what they generally used to be. The corn looks poor, the season now is rather dry. -- Our Friend has Refused his appointment. I am very sorry. I said every thing I could think to persuaid him, but his Lady was against it. I need say no more. -- I believe I did not understand you when in a former Letter you say, ""I want to resign my office for a thousand reasons."" If you meant that of judge I know not what to say. I know it will be a dificult and arduous station but divesting my self of private intrest which would lead me to be against your holding that office, I know of no person who is so well calculated to discharge the Trust, or who I think would act a more consciencious part. My paper is full. I have  room to thank you for it.  "
"Boston  July 13, 1776
","I must begin with  to you for not writing since the  17 of June . I have really had so many cares upon my Hands and Mind, with a bad inflamation in my Eyes that I have not been able to write. I now date from  Boston where I yesterday arrived and was with all 4 of our Little ones innoculated for the small pox. My unkle and Aunt were so kind as to send me an invitation with my family. Mr. Cranch and wife and family, My Sister Betsy and her Little Neice,Cotton Tufts and Mr. Thaxter, a maid who has had the Distemper and my old Nurse compose our family. A Boy too I should have added. 17 in all. My unkles maid with his Little daughter and a Negro Man are here. We had our Bedding &c. to bring. A Cow we have driven down from   [Braintree] and some Hay I have had put into the Stable, wood &c. and we have really commenced housekeepers here. The House was furnished with almost every article (except Beds) which we have free use of, and think ourselves much obliged by the fine accommodations and kind offer of our Friends. All our necessary Stores we purchase jointly. Our Little ones stood the opperation Manfully.Dr. Bulfinch is our Physician. Such a Spirit of innoculation never before took place; the Town and every House in it, as are as full as they can hold. I believe there are not less than 30 persons from  Braintree. Mrs. Quincy,Mrs. Lincoln, Miss Betsy and Nancy are our near Neighbours. God Grant that we may all go comfortably thro the Distemper, the phisick part is bad enough I know. I knew your mind so perfectly upon the subject that I thought nothing, but our recovery would give you eaquel pleasure, and as to safety there was none. The Soldiers innoculated privately, so did many of the inhabitants and the paper curency spread it everywhere. I immediately determined to set myself about it, and get ready with my children. I wish it was so you could have been with us, but I submit. I received some Letters from you last Saturday Night  26 of June . You mention a  Letter of the 16  which I have never received, and I suppose must relate something to private affairs which I wrote about in May and sent by   Harry. As to News we have taken several fine prizes since I wrote you as you will see by the . The present Report is of Lord Hows comeing with unlimited powers. However suppose it is so, I believe he little thinks of treating with us as independant States. How can any person yet dreem of a settlement, accommodations &c. They have neither the spirit nor  feeling of Men, yet I see some who never were call'd Tories, gratified with the Idea of Lord Hows being upon his passage with such powers.  By yesterdays post I received two Letters dated  3  and 4 of July   and tho your Letters never fail to give me pleasure, be the subject what it will, yet it was greatly heightned by the prospect of the future happiness and glory of our Country; nor am I a little Gratified when I reflect that a person so nearly connected with me has had the Honour of being a principal actor, in laying a foundation for its future Greatness. May the foundation of our new constitution, be justice, Truth and Righteousness. Like the wise Mans house may it be founded upon those Rocks and then neither storms or temptests will overthrow it. I cannot but feel sorry that some of the most Manly Sentiments in the Declaration are Expunged from the printed . Perhaps wise reasons induced it. Poor  Canady I lament  Canady but we ought to be in some measure sufferers for the past folly of our conduct. The fatal effects of the small pox there, has led almost every person to consent to Hospitals in every Town. In many Towns, already   Boston the Selectmen  [illegible]   have granted Liberty for innoculation. I hope the necessity is now fully seen. I had many  Sensations at the Thoughts of comeing myself, but to see my children thro it I thought my duty, and all those feelings vanished as soon as I was innoculated and I trust a kind providence will carry me safely thro. Our Friends from  Plymouth came into Town yesterday. We have enough upon our hands in the morning. The Little folks are very sick then and puke every morning but after that they are comfortable. I shall write you now very often. Pray inform me constantly of every important transaction. Every expression of tenderness is a cordial to my Heart. Unimportant as they are to the rest of the world, to me they are every Thing. We have had during all the month of June a most severe  which cut of all our promising hopes of english Grain and the first crop of Grass, but since july came in we have had a plenty of rain and now every thing looks well. There is one Misfortune in our family which I have never mentiond in hopes it would  have been in my power to have remedied it, but all hopes of that kind are at an end. It is the loss of your Grey Horse. About 2 months ago, I had occasion to send Jonathan of an errant to my unkle Quincys (the other Horse being a plowing). Upon his return a little below the church she trod upon a rolling stone and lamed herself to that degree that it was with great difficulty that she could be got home. I immediately sent for Tirrel and every thing was done for her by Baths, ointments, polticeing, Bleeding &c. that could be done. Still she continued extreem lame tho not so bad as at first. I then got her carried to Domet but he pronounces her incurable, as a callous is grown upon her footlock joint. You can hardly tell, not even now by your own feelings how much I lament her. She was not with foal, as you immagined, but I hope she is now as care has been taken in that Respect. I suppose you have heard of a fleet which came up pretty near the Light and kept us all with our mouths open ready to catch them, but after staying near a week and  what observations they could set sail and went of to our great mortification who were  [prepared?] to for them in every respect. If our Ship of 32 Guns which  [was] Built at  Portsmouth and waiting only for Guns and an other of  [ . . . ]  at  Plimouth in the same state, had been in readiness we should in all probability been Masters of them. Where the blame lies in that respect I know not, tis laid upon Congress, and Congress is also blamed for not appointing us a General. -- But  Rome was not Built in a day. I hope the Multiplicity of cares and avocations which  you will not be too powerfull for you. I have many anxietyes upon that account.Nabby and Johnny send duty and desire Mamma to say that an inflamation in their Eyes which has been as much of a distemper as the small pox, has prevented their writing, but they hope soon to be able to acquaint Pappa of their happy recovery from the Distemper. --  Mr.  [Cranch] and wife, Sister  [Betsy] and all our Friends desire to be rememberd to you and foremost in that Number stands your PS A little  India herb would have been mighty agreeable now. "
"
July 21 1776 Boston","I have no doubt but that my dearest Friend is anxious to know how his  does, and his little flock of children under the opperation of a disease once so formidable. I have the pleasure to tell him that they are all comfortable  some of them of complaining. Nabby has been very ill, but the Eruption begins to make its appearence upon her, and upon Johnny. Tommy is so well that the Dr. innoculated him again to day fearing it had not taken. Charlly has no complaints yet, tho his arm has been very soar. I have been out to meeting this forenoon, but have so many  Sensations this afternoon that I thought it prudent to tarry at home. The Dr. says they are very good feelings.Mr. Cranch has passed thro the preparation and the Eruption is comeing out cleverly upon him without any Sickness at all. Mrs. Cranch is cleverly and so are all her children. Those who are broke out are pretty full for the new method as tis call'd, the Suttonian they profess to practice upon. I hope to give you a good account when I write next, but our Eyes are very weak and the Dr. is not fond of either writing or reading for his patients. But I must transgress a little. I received a Letter from you by  Post  7 of July  and tho I think it a choise one in the Litterary Way, containing many usefull hints and judicious observations which will greatly assist me in the future instruction of our Little ones, yet it Lacked some essential engrediants to make it compleat. Not one word respecting yourself, your Health or your present Situation. My anxiety for your welfare will never leave me but with my parting Breath, tis of more importance to me than all this World contains besides.  The cruel Seperation to which I am necessatated cuts of half the enjoyments of life, the other half are comprised in the hope I have that what I do and what I suffer may be serviceable to you, to our Little ones and our Country; I must beseach you therefore for the future never to omit what is so essential to my happiness. Last Thursday after hearing a very Good Sermon I went with the Multitude into Kings Street to hear the proclamation for  read and proclamed. Some Field peices with the Train were brought there, the troops appeard under Arms and all the inhabitants assembled there (the small pox prevented many thousand from the Country). When Col. Crafts read from the Belcona of the State House the Proclamation, great attention was given to every word. As soon as he ended, the cry from the Belcona, was God Save our American States and then 3 cheers which rended the air, the Bells rang, the privateers fired, the forts and Batteries, the cannon were discharged, the platoons followed and every face appeard joyfull.Mr. Bowdoin then gave a  [illegible]   Sentiment, Stability and perpetuity to American independance. After dinner the kings arms were taken down from the State House and every vestage of him from every place in which it appeard and burnt in King Street. Thus ends royall Authority in this State, and all the people shall say Amen. I have been a little  that we collect no better accounts with regard to the horrid conspiricy at  New York, and that so little mention  has been made of it here. It made a talk for a few days but now seems all hushed in Silence. The Tories say that it was not a conspiricy but an association, and pretend that there was no plot to assasinate the General. Even their hardned Hearts Blush feel -- the discovery. We have in Gorge a match for a Borgia and a Catiline, a Wretch Callous to every Humane feeling.  [illegible]   Our worthy preacher told us that he believed one of our Great Sins for which a righteous God has come out in judgment against us, was our Biggoted attachment to so wicked a Man. May our repentance be sincere. I omitted many things yesterday in order to be better informed. I have got Mr. Cranch to inquire and write you, concerning a French Schooner from Martineco which came in yesterday and a prize from  Ireland. My own infirmities prevents my writing.  A most Excruciating pain in my head and every Limb and joint I hope portends a speedy Eruption and prevents my saying more than that I am forever Yours. The children are not yet broke out. Tis the Eleventh Day with us. "
" [Boston,  24 July 1776]",  Regards to Mr. Hancock with thanks for his very polite and generous offer and Let him know that I entertain a gratefull Sense of his kindness. My Regards to his Lady too who I hear is in thriveing circumstances. I wish they may be blessed with a fine Son. -- Mr. Winthrope deliverd me yours of  July 7.  Mr. Gerry is not yet arrived. We have not any news. My Eyes will suffer for this exertion.  Adieu ever Ever Yours.  
"Boston  july 29, 1776
","I write you now, thanks be to Heaven, free from , in Good Spirits, but weak and feeble. All my Sufferings produced but one Eruption. I think I can have no reason to be doubtfull with regard to myself as the Symptoms run so high and my Arm opperated in the best manner. The small pox acts very odly this Season, there are Seven out of our Number that have not yet had it, 3 out of our 4 children have been twice innoculated, two of them Charles and Tommy have not had one Symptom. I have indulged them in rather freer living than before and hope they will not long remain doubtfull. Mrs. Cranch and Cotton Tufts have been in Town almost 3 weeks and have had the innoculation repeated 4 times and can not make it take. So has Mrs. Lincoln. Lucy Cranch and Billy are in the same State. Becky Peck who has lived in the same Manner with us, has it to such a degree as to be blind with one Eye, swell'd prodigiously, I believe she has ten Thousand. She is really an object to look at; tho she is not Dr. Bulfinches patient. Johnny has it exactly as one would wish, enough to be well satisfied and yet not be troublesome. We are ordered all the Air we can get, and when we cannot walk we must ride, and if we can neither walk nor ride, we must be led. We sleep with windows open all Night, and Lay upon the Carpet or Straw Beds, Mattrass or any thing hard, abstain from Spirit, Salt and fats, fruit we Eat, all we can get, and those who like vegetables unseasond may Eat them, but that is not I. -- This doubtfull Buisness is very dissagreable as it will detain us much longer, but there are several instances now of persons who thought they had had it, and were recoverd, and lived away freely, and now are plentifully dealt by. Mr. Joseph Edwards wife for one, and queer work she makes of it you may be sure. The Doctors say they cannot account for it, unless the free presperation throws it off. Every physician has a number of patients in this doubtfull State. Where it does take and the patient lives any thing free, they have a Doze of it. Cool weather is much fitter for the small pox. I have not got rid of any terrors of the small pox but that of not being liable to it again, which you will say is a very great one; but what I mean is that I should dread it more now than before I saw it, were I liable to it. If we consider the great numbers who have it now, computed at seven thousand,  3 thousand of which are from the Country, tis very favorable, tho not so certain as it was last winter with many patients. Mr. Shaw who was innoculated at the same time when I and 3 of my children were out of the same Box, and has lived lower by his account than we have, has a full portion of it for all of us. There is no accounting for it. We did not take so much phisick as many others neither. If this last does not take I shall certainly try them with some wine. Dr. Sawyer of   lost a child 9 years old last week with the Distemper, and Coll. Robinson of  Dorchester lies extreem bad with a mortification in his kidneys. Some such instances we must expect among such a variety of persons and constitutions. I rejoice Exceedingly at the Success which General Lee has met with. I believe the Men will come along in a short time. They are raising, but the   has been draind for Sea Service as well as land. The Men were procured in this Town last week; we have taken a vessel from  Halifax bound to  New York, which we should call a prize but that it containd about 14 Tories among whom is that infamous Wretch of a Ben Davis the Ginger Bread Robber. How many little ones can say I was an Hungry and you  [illegible]   gave me no Bread, but inhumanely took what little I had from me. I wish the Sea or any other Element had them rather than we should be tormented with them. Friends and connextions are very bad things in such times as these. Interest will be made, and impartial justice obstructed, we catch flies and let the wasps go. -- Hark a General Huzza of the populace, these wretches are just committed to jail. The Continential Troops are near all gone from this Town, all I believe who are in a Marching State. The small pox has been General amongst them and exceeding . I have requested of  to write you an account of his circut and he has  promised to do it. Both he and his Lady are under innoculation. When I came into Town I was in great hopes that if we did well we should be able to return in about 3 weeks, and we should have been able to have effected it, if it had opperated as formerly. Now I fear it will be 5 weeks before we shall all get through but I must not complain. When I cast my eye upon Becky whose Symptoms were not half so high as mine or some of the rest of us, and see what an object she is I am silenced, and adore the Goodness of God towards us. Her Dr. says she is not dangerous.  Warren has sufferd as much pain as I did, but has more to shew for it, he is very cleverly spatterd. Mrs. Warren is now strugling with it, to one of her constitution it opperates in faintings and langour. It did so upon Betsy Cranch, yet when it found its way through, it opperated kindly. -- I believe you will be tired of hearing of small pox, but you bid me write every post and suppose you are anxious to hear how we have it. The next post I hope to tell you that we they all have it, who now remain uncertain.  I am at all times and in all States unfeignedly yours.  "
July 30 1776,"I wrote you by the post, but as  Cuznow  [Cazneau] goes to morrow perhaps this may reach  [you] first. As to myself I am comfortable.Johnny is cleverly.Nabby I hope has gone thro the distemper, the Eruption was so trifling that to be certain I have had innoculation repeated. Charles and Tommy have neither had Symptoms, nor Eruption.Charles was innoculated last Sabbeth evening a second time, Tommy to Day, the 3 time from some fresh matter taken from Becky Peck who has enough for all the House beside. This  is painfull. I know not what to do with them. It lengthens out the Time which I can but ill afford, and if they can have it, I know not how to quit till I can get them through. Youth youth is the time, they have no pains but bodily, no anxiety of mind, no fears for themselves or others, and then the Disease is much lighter. The poor Doctor is as anxious as we are, but begs us to make it certain if repeated innoculations will do it. There are now several patients who were innoculated last winter and thought they passd through the Distemper, but have now taken it in the natural way. Mrs. Cranch and two of her children are in this uncertain State, with a great number of others  which I could mention. Tis a pestilence that walketh in Darkness. Mrs. Warren with whom I was yesterday, lay the whole day in a State little better than nonexistance. I greatly feard she would not survive it, but to day she is revived and many pocks appear upon her. But tis a poor Buisness at the best, where I entertaind one terror before, I do ten now. The Season of the year is very unfit for the Distemper, the Tone of every persons vessels are relaxed, very little Spring in the Air, and the medicine too powerfull for weak constitutions. I hope to be properly  that I and mine are so far so comfortable through -- I think I have all my difficulties to Grapple with alone and seperete from my Earthly prop and Support. I begin to long again for the sweet air of  Braintree, and the time to come will be much longer than the time past. Pray Let Mr. Hancock know that I have  myself of his kind offer so far as to send for some fruit from his Garden.Every thing here bears such a prize as would surprize you to be told. The Gentery were kind enough to cut down a number of my unkles fruit Trees last winter, and to cut up his Current Bushes, but we have had kind Friends. Mrs. Newall has been exceedingly so. -- Pray make my Regards to the presidents Lady and tell her since she baulked me of the wedding cake to which I laid claim by promise, I expect she will remember me upon an other occasion which I hear is like to take place. O my dear Friend do you know how I feel when I look Back upon a long absence. I look forward with the Thought that the year is but half spent. I often recollect those lines ""O ye Gods annialate but time and Space, and make two Lovers happy."" I have the pleasure to tell you this morning that I think  second innoculation has taken as he was very ill last night and the eruptive fever seems   [the following appears along the right margin of page 2, see page image]  comeing on. Tis ten days since the second.  "
"Boston  August 1 1776
","I wrote you by  Cazneau a wedensday, but as the post will go to day I will not omit telling you how we do, tho I repeat over what I have written before. If I do you must excuse it as I forget one day what I wrote the day before. This small pox is a great confuser of the mind, I am really put to it to spell the commonest words. I feel well myself, only much weakened and , I want the air of the Country, but cannot yet obtain it. We are bounded in our rides to the Lines which were raised last summer, where a smoak House and Guard are fixed. No person who has had the small pox can go beyond them, under a penalty of  [ . . . ]  pounds Lawfull money, under a time Limitted and a certificate from their Physician. Every person who comes into Town must be smoaked there upon their return with all their money and papers. Tommy is charmingly, he has about a Dozen out, and many more which just make their appearence. He has been very feverish, but is now so well as to go to School. I gave him a small Quantity of meat every day after his second innoculation till the Symptoms came on. Charles second has taken, I think but cannot be certain till next week. I Received a  by Mr. Gerry  your Letter of july 15 . I have not yet seen him only to speak to him. only I knew him at  meeting yesterday some how instinctively; tho I never saw him before. He has not call'd upon me yet. I hope he will, or I shall take it very hard, shall hardly be able to allow him all the merrit you say he possesses. It will be no small pleasure to me to see a person who has so lately seen my best Friend. I could find it in my Heart to envy him. You complain of me. I believe I was to blame in not writing to you, I ought to have done it. I did not suspect you would hear of my intention till I told you myself. I had many cares upon my hands, any things to do for myself and family before I could leave it. The time granted  only ten days. I got here upon the 6th and then  [wrote] you a very long Letter. Since that I have scarcly omitted a Post, you will have more reason to complain of being tired out; I find the Method of treating the small pox here is similar to that sent by Dr. Rush, except that they use Mercury here. The common Practice here to an Adult is 20 Grains after innoculation. I took but 16; I dont admire this Mercury at this Season of the Year. Loyd I find practicess much more upon Dr. Rushs plan, makes use of the same medicines, but has not had greater success than others. I greatly rejoice at the  Spirit prevailing in the middle colonies. There is a fine company formed in this Town, by call'd the independant company consisting of young Gentlemen of the first families. Their Number is 80, they are the School for forming officers, they take great pains to acquire military Skill and will make a fine figure in a little while. Your Pupil Mason is one. He is an ambitious enterprizing creature and will make a figure some how or other, he always applies to his studies with method and diligence. I have lamented it that you have not been able to take him under your perticuliar care, as I know abilities would have gratified you. I Received by the Post a few lines from you  july 20 . It really  me to find you so anxious. Your kindness in so often writing shall be returnd in kind. I know not how you find the time amidst such a multitude of cares as surround you, but I feel myself more obliged by the frequent tokens of your remembrance, but you must not forget that tho my Letters have much less merrit, they have many more words, snd I fill all the blank paper you send me.  Adieu most affectionately your   "
"Boston  August 5 1776
","I this Evening Received  Your two Letters of july 10  and  11 , and last Evening the Post brought me  yours of july 23 . I am really astonished at looking over the Number I have received during this month, more I believe than for 3 months before. I hope  your amusement and relaxation from care to be thus imployed. It has been a feast to me during my absence from Home, and cheerd me in my most painfull Moments. At Last I Hear what I have long expected, and have feard for some time. I was certain that your Nerves must bee new Braced, and your Constitution new moulded, to continue well, through such a load of Buisness. Such intense application, in such a climate through the burning Heats of the Summer, tis too much for a constitution of Steel, and ought not to be required. I  you to return, and that speidily. Mr. Gerry has recoverd his Health and Spirits by his journey. He call'd upon me a few moments. I knew Him by the same instinct by which I first discoverd him, and ventured to call him by Name tho his person was never discribed to me. I cannot account for it but so it was. He appeard a modest Man, and has a fine inteligent Eye. I wanted to ask him many questions which I  [could] not do as he was a stranger, and we had company. He has promised to call upon me again before he returns which he proposes to do in about ten Days. I have been trying all day to get time to write to you. I am now obliged to Rob my Sleep. Mrs. Cranch, Billy and Lucy are very unwell, all of them with the Symptoms I suppose.Lucy I fear has taken the Distemper in the natural way, as  more than 3 weeks since she was innoculated, and her Arm being inflamed deceived us. I took the precaution of having all mine who had not the Symptoms the 9th day innoculated a second time, and I hope they have all pass'd through except Charlly, and what to do with him I know not. I cannot get the small pox to opperate upon him, his Arm both times has been very soar, and he lives freely, that is he eats a small Quantity of meat, and I have given him wine but all will not do. Tommy is cleverly, has about a dozen, and is very gay and happy. I have abundant reason to be  that we are so many of us carried comfortably through a Disease so formidable in its natural opperation, and though our  Symptoms have run high, yet they have been the worst, for the Eruption has been a triffel, really should have been glad to have had them in greater plenty. I hope to be able to return to  Braintree the Latter end of next week which will compleat me 5 weeks. I have been unlucky in a Maid, who has not one qualification to recommend her but that she has had the small pox. She has been twice sick since she has been with us, and put us to much difficulty. I have attended publick worship constantly, except one day and a half ever since I have been in Town. I rejoice in a preacher who has some warmth, some energy, some feeling. Deliver me from your cold phlegmatick Preachers, Politicians, Friends, Lovers and Husbands. I thank Heaven I am not so constituted my-self and so connected. How destitute are they of all those Sensations which sweeten as well as embitter our probationary State! And How seldom do we find true  residing in such a constitution, but may I ask if the same temperament and the same Sensibility which constitutes a poet and a painter will not be apt to make a Lover and a Debauchee? When I reflect upon Humane Nature, the various passions and appetites to which it is subject, I am ready to cry out with the Psalmist Lord what is Man? You ask me How you shall get Home. I know not. Is there any assistance you can think of that I can procure for you. Pray Let me know. Our Court do not set till the 28 of this month, no delegates can be chosen to  you till then, but if you are so low in Health do not wait for that. Mr. Bowdoin has the Gout in his Stomack, is very ill. I do not think he could by any means bear close application. Mr. Dana and Mr. Lowell are very good Men, I wish they would appoint them. Our Friend Warren has some family difficulties. I know not whether he could possibly leave it. A partner dear to him you know beyond description almost Heart broken, by the Situation of one very dear to her whose great attention and care you well know has been  to Train them up in the way in which they ought to go. Would to Heaven they did not depart from it. Impaired in Health, impaird in mind, impaird in Morrals, is a Situation truly deplorable, but do not mention the Matter -- not even to them by the slightest hint. Tis a wound which cannot be touched. God grant we may never mourn a similiar Situation, but I have some times the Heartake when I look upon the fire, spirit and vivacity,  to a comely person in the Eldest, soft, tender and pathetick in the second, Manly, firm and intrepid in the third. I fear less for him, but alass we are short sighted mortals.  Adieu dearest Best of Friends adieu.  "
" [Boston,  ca. 12 August 1776]","Yours 30 of July   me by Saturdays post, and found me with Johnny and Tommy quite Recoverd from the small Pox. When I first came to Town I was made to believe that the small pox was a very light disorder, and one might pass through it with little or no complaints. Some such instances no doubt there are, and Light it is in comparison of the Natural way, or what it formerly was. As I never saw the disease before I have with those much more experienced been deceived in it now.  was the first person who had complaints of our number, hers came on about the 8th day attended with a voilent pain in a tooth which she had which was defective. She was cold and shivery, then a voilent Heat insued; the doctor supposed it the Symptoms of the disorder, a day or two after she had 3 Eruptions upon one of her Eyes. I thought it did not appear like what I had seen which they calld small pox, however I submitted my judgment to those who knew better. But when I found some who were innoculated at the same time failing, I requested the dr. to innoculate her again. Symptoms she has had very severely and very diffirent from what she had before and small pox in plenty, she can reckon 500 allready. She is cleverly only soar, I am much better satisfied now, and we rejoice when we can reckon a hundred. I believe I mentiond to you my Aunts Little Daughter having recoverd of it, but there again we were deceived, the child has been ill these 3 Days and now is broke out with small pox. -- Here I have been a month Last fryday, and for ought I see must be for this fortnight to come. I have broke through my resolution of not having Charles innoculated again. I saw I must tarry for Nabby long enough to make an other trial upon him, and have accordingly done it. -- We clear of some this week. Sister Betsy and her Neice, Mr. Tufts, Betsy Cranch and Johnny are going tomorrow. My affairs at home which for 3 weeks I laid asleep, wake up now, and make me anxious to get there. I fear they will go to ruin. My Expences here too for so long atime will be much more than I expectd for I thought to be at home in a month at furthes furthest. -- Lucy Cranch who I mentiond having taken the Distemper in the Natural Way is cleverly -- pretty full and large.
Page 3
 -- And now about your returning. I am shut up here, and wholly unable to do that for you, which I might endeavour to if I was at home, and then the fate of your poor horse which I must ever lament makes it necessary to procure two Horses and a very great Scarcity there are. I think I should advice you if you could light of a good Horse, to procure one there, as you will stand in need of one when you return. A prize was brought in here Last Saturday with 400 Hogsheads of Sugar, 300 of rum and 400 Bags of cotton taken by one White in  Darbys  [Derby's] employ and is the 7th taken by him within these ten days.  was here to see me a few days past and requested me to make mention of her case to you, and to desire you to render her all the assistance you can. Said she would write to you and state the Situation she was in. She wrote once to the president but had no reply. I close to send by the Post rejoiceing in the Prospect I have of soon seeing you.  Ever yours.  "

"," call'd upon me to day and told me he should set out tomorrow for  Philadelphia, desired I would write by him. I have shewn him all the civility in my power since he has been here, tho not all I have wished too. Our Situation and numerous family as well as sick family prevented our asking him to dine. He drank tea with us once and Breakfasted once with us. I was much pleasd with the account he gave us of the universal joy of his province upon the Establishment of their New Government, and of the Harmony subsisting between every branch of it. This State seems to be behind hand of their Neighbours. We want some Master workmen here. Those who are capable seem backward in this work and some who are so tenacious of their own perticuliar plan as to be loth to give it up. Some who are for abolishing both House and Counsel, affirming Buisness was never so well done as in provincial Congress, and they perhaps never so important. Last Sunday after Service the Declaration of  was read from the pulpit by order of Counsel. The Dr. concluded with asking a Blessing upon the  united States of America even untill the final restitution of all things. Dr. Chancys  [Chauncy's] address pleasd me. The Good Man after having read it, lifted his Eyes and hands to Heaven -- God Bless the  united States of America, and Let all the People say Amen. One of His Audiance told me it universally struck them.  I have no News to write you, I am sure it will be none to tell you that I am ever yours, "
August 14 1776,"I wrote you  by Mr. Smith but as I suppose this will reach you sooner, I omitted mentioning any thing of my family in it.  has enough of the small Pox for all the family beside. She is pretty well coverd, not a spot but what is so soar that she can neither walk sit stand or lye lay with any comfort. She is as patient as one can expect, but they are a very soar sort. If it was a disorder to which we could be subject more than once I would go as far as it was possible to avoid it. She is sweld a good deal. You will receive a perticuliar account before this reaches you of the uncommon manner in which the small Pox acts, it bafels the skill of the most Experience'd here. Billy Cranch is now out with about 40, and so well as not to be detaind at Home an hour for it. Charlly remains in the same state he did. Your Letter of August 3  came by this days Post. I find it very  to be so handy. I can receive a Letter at Night, sit down and reply to it, and send it of in the morning. You remark upon the deficiency   of Education in your Countrymen. It never  I believe was in a worse state, at least for many years. I believe The Colledge is not in the state one could wish, the Schollars complain that their professer in Philosophy is taken of by publick Buisness to their great detriment. In this Town I never saw so great a neglect of Education. The poorer sort of children are wholly neglected, and left to range the Streets without Schools, without Buisness, given up to all Evil. The Town is not as formerly divided into Wards. There is either too much Buisness left upon the hands of a few, or too little care to do it. We daily see the Necessity of a regular Goverment.You speak of our Worthy Brother. I often lament it that a Man so peculiarly formed for the Education of youth, and so well qualified as he is in many Branches of Litrature, excelling in Philosiphy and the Mathematicks, should not be imployd in some publick Station. I know not the person who would make half so good a Successor to Dr. Winthrope. He has a peculiar easy manner of communicating his Ideas to Youth, and the Goodness of his Heart, and the purity of his morrals without an affected austerity must have a happy Effect upon the minds of Pupils. If you complain of  neglect of Education in sons, What shall I say with regard to daughters, who every day experience the want of it. With regard to the Education of my own children, I find myself soon out of my debth, and destitute and deficient in every part of Education. I most sincerely wish that some more liberal plan might be laid and executed for the Benefit of the rising Generation, and that our new constitution may be distinguished for Learning and Virtue. If we mean to have Heroes, Statesmen and Philosophers, we should have learned women. The world perhaps would laugh at me, and accuse me of vanity, But you I know have a mind too enlarged and liberal to disregard the Sentiment. If much depends as is allowed upon the early Education of youth and the first principals which are  take the deepest root, great benifit must arise from litirary accomplishments in women. Excuse me my pen has run away with me. I have no thoughts of  to   [Philadelphia]. The length of time I have  [and] shall be detaind here would have prevented me, even if you had no thoughts of returning till December, but I live  in daily Expectation of seeing you here. Your Health I think requires your immediate return. I expected Mr. Gerry would have set off before now, but he finds it perhaps very hard to leave his Mistress -- I wont say harder than some do to leave their wives. Mr. Gerry stood very high in my Esteem -- what is meat for one is not for an other -- no accounting for fancy. She is a queer dame and leads people wild dances. But hush -- Post, dont betray your trust and loose my Letter.  is poorly this morning. The pock are near the turn, 6 or 7 hundred boils are no agreable feeling. You and I know not what a feeling it is. Miss Katy can tell. I had but 3 they were very clever and fill'd nicely. The Town instead of being clear of this distemper are now in the height of it, hundreds having it in the natural way through the deceitfulness of innoculation.  Adieu ever yours. Breakfast waits. "
"Boston,  August 17 1776
"," I wrote you two Letters yesterday one by the Post and one by Mr. Smith, yet I will not omit this by your Worthy Friend Mr. Gerry who has promised to drink tea with me this afternoon; I admire his modesty and his annimatd countanance. I hope this will meet you upon your return to  New england, where I assure you I think you are wanted. If you get back before the last of this month you will be soon enough to attend the  Court if you chuse it which is to sit in your own Town. As to news we go on Briskly taking prizes. We have a plenty of Sugars. Within these ten days Sugars have fallen from 4 pounds to 3 and 2.8 by the hundred. A Brigg was carried into   this Week, from  Antigue laiden with Indigo and hides, and a  Jamaca Man carried into  Marble Head. Our Men the new Leavies have marched for  Canada. Isaac  [Copeland] who lived with us is gone as one. I this day Received a Letter from Mr. Rice dated july 27 from  Ticondoroga, he give much the same account that you did in a former Letter to me. Their Sufferings have been great indeed. The True Source of these Evils ought to be searched out, and the foul streams cleansed. As to our Hospital , Nabby has not been out of her chamber these 3 Days, neither can she stand or sit her foot to the floor. She has above a thousand pussels as large as a great Green Pea. She is the Dr. says in a good way tho tis hard to make her think so. Charles complains some to day. I hope tis the Symptoms. I have had a Seige of it, I long for the compaign to be over.  I have really wrote you so much this week that I have little or nothing worth saying or telling you. I have not time to enter upon any subject which requires attention, and can only add that I am ever yours,  "
"Monday August 18  [i.e. 19], 1776","I set down to write you a few lines by the post, because I would not omit one opportunity. I received  yours of August 6  but cannot tell what to do for you confined as I am here. I shall know what you would have me do by Mr. A when he returns. At present all my attention is taken up with the care of our Little  who has been very bad. The Symptoms rose to a burning fever, a stupifaction and delirium ensued for 48 hours. The Doctor attended him as tho he had been his own child. He has the Distemper in the natural way. A most plentifull Eruption has taken place. Tho every thing has been done to lessen it that could, his face will be quite coverd, many if not all will run together. He is yet a very ill child, tho his Symptoms are lessend. I would not have  you. I hope he is not dangerous, but we cannot tell the Event. Heaven grant it may be favorable. I will write you by wedensday Post. I shall see then how he is like to be, and can form a better judgment of Him. -- Nabby is Cleverly. They are turning fast upon her; and she can walk to day with borrowing my Shooes and Stockings.  Adieu the Post will leave me. Dont forget my Herbs for your own sake as well as mine. -- Ever yours.  "
"Boston  August 22 1776
","Yours of August 12 came to hand by last Nights post.Mr. and Coll. [Whippie] are not yet returnd so that I know not what you have wrote by them, but by your Letter of this date I suppose tis something relative to your Return. I shall this morning in consequence of your Letter write to Mr. Bass who I make no doubt will be very ready to come for you. I shall write to my Father to request of him that he would endeavour to procure for you a couple of Horses. I shall try some other Friends and will fix of Bass as soon as tis possible to procure Horses for you. As to the other matters you desired to be informed of, at present I am not capable of acquainting  any further than that I do not believe we have a 100 men as soldiers in this Town. I now and then see a scattering one, but the Militia are not yet come in.  Fort Hill is a Beautiful peice of work, I am told not Eaquel to  Dorchester. There are about 15 or 20 fine large peices of cannon mounted with Ball &c. by the side of them. We have spaird 700 Barrels of powder to N.Y. We have 600 left as publick Stores. What force we have else where I know not. I have inquired but find every person I have asked as Ignorant as I am. I can learn more in one hour from General Palmer relative to the state of things than I can from all the rest of the persons I converse with and yet I have inquired of those who I think ought to know. I hear General  is appointed in the room of  [Ward]. Has he Spirit enough, has he activity, has he ambition enough for the place? -- I will endeavour to be informd of all you inquire about and write you the best account I can. As to applying to -- for Horses, I remember the old proverb, he who waits for dead mens shooes may go barefoot. It would only lengthen out the time, and we should be no better of, than before I askd. I will have them if they are to be had at any price, and they  may pay for them. I think you have done your part. I am told that they will appoint somebody to releave you but will not release you. As to one article you ask about I can tell you we have no scarcity of provisions. In Town upon account of the small pox they are very dear. Ever since june there has been no want of rain and as great a  as was ever known. I have been in Town six weeks yesterday. Charlly is better. He is exceeding full, but the little creature is as patient as a Lamb. We carry him out into the air all we can, in the Height of dog days a very bad time for small pox; but we think he will do well. I hope to be able to get Home by the Last of Next Week.  are most all turnd and going of. She looks speckled. I am in great Haste, Mr. Cranch and family leave me tomorrow.  I will write by mondays post. Adieu ever Yours, "
"Boston  August 25 1776
","I sent  last Evening to the Post office for Letters. He soon returnd and pulling one from under his Gown gave it me, the young Rogue smiling and watching Mammas countanance draws out an other, and then an other, highly gratified to think he had so many presents to bestow. Our Friends are very kind. My Father sends his Horse and Dr. Tufts has  me an other one he had of unkle  [Quincy] about 5 year old. He has never been journeys, but is able enough. Mr. Bass is just come, and says he cannot sit out till tomorrow week without great damage to his Buisness. He has been a long time out of Stock, and about a week ago obtaind a Quantity and has engaged 20 pair of shooes which will be eaquel to 20 Dollors to him, which he must losse if I will not consent to his tarrying till then. Tho I urged him to sit of tomorrow, yet the Horses will be in a better State as they will not be used and more able to perform the journey. I am obliged to consent to his tarrying till then when you may certainly expect him. Bass is  that the Drs. Horse will not be able to travel so fast as he must go. He will go and see him, and in case he is not your Brother has promised to let one of his go. I only have to regret that I did not sooner make trial of my Friends, and have sent for you 3 weeks ago. I fear you will think me neglegent, and inatentive. If I had been at Home, I should have been sooner in a capacity to have assisted you. I was talking of sending for you and trying to procure horses for you when little Charles who lay upon the couch coverd over with small Pox, and nobody knew that he heard or regarded any thing which was said, lifted up his head and says Mamma, take my Dollor and get a Hos Horse for Pappa. Poor fellow has had a tedious time of it as well as I, but tis now upon the turn, and he is much easier, and better. I hope I shall be able to get out of Town a Saturday next. Mr. and Mrs. Cranch with their  went out a fryday. I feel rather lonely. Such a change from 1 or 2 and twenty to only 5 or 6 is a great alteration. I took the Liberty of sending my complements to General Lincoln and asking him some questions which you get to proposed to me, but which I was really unable to answer, and he has promised me a perticuliar reply to them. As to provisions there is no Scarcity. Tis true they are high, but that is more  to the advanced price of Labour than the Scarcity. English Goods of every kind are not purchasable, at least by me. They are extravagantly high,  West india articles are very high all except Sugars, which have fallen half since I came into Town. Our  New England Rum is 4 Shillings pr. Gallon, Molasses the same price. Loaf Sugar 2s. 4d. pr. pound, cotton wool 4 Shillings pr. pound, sheeps wool 2 Shillings, flax 1 & 6. In short one hundred pound two year ago would purchase more than two will now. House Rent in this Town is very low. Some of the best and  Genteelest houses in Town rent for 20 pounds pr. year. Ben Hollowell  [Hallowell's] has been offerd for 10. and Mr. Shurdens  [Chardon's] for 13 6 & 8 pence. The privateer  which saild from  Plymouth about 3 weeks ago has taken a jamaca man laiden with Sugars and sent her into  Marblehead last Saturday. I hear the Defence has taken an other. I think we make a fine hand at prizes.   [Quincy] desires me to ask you whether you have received a Letter from him, he wrote you some time ago. I like Dr.  device for a Seal. It is such a one as will please most -- at least it will be most agreable to the Spirit of  New england. We have not any news here -- anxiously waiting the Event, and in daily Expectation of hearing  tidings from  New york. Heaven Grant  they may be Glorious for our Country and Country men, then will I glory in being an American.  Ever ever Yours, PS We are in such want of Lead as to be obliged to take down the Leads from the windows in this Town.  "
"Boston  August 29 1776
","Dearest Friend I have spent the 3 days past almost  with you. The weather has been stormy, I have had little company, and I have amused my self in my closet reading over the Letters I have received from you since I have been here. I have possession of my Aunts chamber in which you know is a very conveniant pretty closet with a window which looks into her  Garden. In this closet are a number of Book Shelves, which are but poorly furnished, however I have a pretty little desk or cabinet here where I write all my Letters and keep my papers unmollested by any one. I do not covet my Neighbours Goods, but I should like to be the owner of such conveniances. I always had a fancy for a closet with a window which I could more peculiarly call my own. Here I say I have amused myself in reading and thinking of my absent Friend, sometimes with a mixture of , sometimes with pleasure, sometimes anticipating a joyfull and happy meeting, whilst my Heart would bound and palpitate with the pleasing Idea, and with the purest affection I have held you to my Bosom till my whole Soul has dissolved in Tenderness and my pen fallen from my Hand. How often do I reflect with pleasure that I hold in possession a Heart  warm with my own, and full as Susceptable of the Tenderest impressions, and Who even now whilst he is reading here, feels all I discribe. Forgive this Revere, this Delusion, and since I am  real, suffer me, to enjoy, and indulge In Ideal pleasures -- and tell me they are not inconsistant with the stern virtue of a senator and a Patriot. I must leave my pen to recover myself and write in  strain. I feel anxious for a post day, and am full as solicitious for two Letters a week and as uneasy if I do not get them, as I used to be when I got but one in a month or 5 weeks. Thus do I presume upon indulgance, and this is Humane Nature, and brings to my mind a sentiment of one of your correspondents viz. ""That Man is the only animal who is hungery with His Belly full."" Last Evening Dr. Cooper came in and brought me  your  from the post office of August 18   and Coll. Whipple arrived yesterday morning and deliverd me the two Bundles you sent, and a  Letter of the 12 of August . They have already afforded me much amusement, and I expect much more from them. I am sorry to find from your last as well as from some others of your Letters that you feel so dissatisfied with the office to which you are chosen. in your acceptance of it, I know you was actuated by the purest motives, and I know of no person here so well qualified to discharge the important Duties of it, Yet I will not urge you to it. In accepting of it you must be excluded from all other employments. There never will be a Salery addequate to the importance of the office or to support you and your family from penury. If you possess a fortune I would urge you to it, in spight of all the Hears and gibes of minds who themselves are incapable of acting a disintrested part, and have no conception that others can. I have never heard any  about it, nor did I know that such insinuations had been Thrown out. Pure and disintrested Virtue must ever be its own reward.   Mankind are too selfish and too depraved to discover the pure Gold from the baser mettle. I wish for peace and tranquility. All my desires and all my ambition is to be Esteemed and Loved by my Partner, to  join with him in the Education and instruction of our Little ones, to set under our own vines in Peace, Liberty and Safety. Adieu my Dearest Friend,  soon, soon return to your most affectionate PS  is clevery. A very odd report has been propagated in  Braintree viz. at that you were poisond upon your return at  N.Y.Bass sets of on monday.  "
Thursday August 29 1776,"I have this moment sent of a Letter to the post office when Mr.Bass came in to let me know that he has got ready sooner than he expected and will now sit of. I cannot let him go without a line to tell you I feel a new flow of spirits, hope to be home and well to receive you. Write me by every Post, and let me know when you expect to sit out. My Best wishes attend you ever yours,  "
August 31 1776,"My Dearest Friend You know not How  I was to Night when the Post came in and I received no Letter from You. Tis the first Saturdays post which has come in since I have been in Town without a Letter from you. It has given me more pain to Night than it would any other time, because of some Falce and foolish reports I hope. I will not, more than I can help, give way to  which I have no reason to believe true. Yet at such a time as this when all the Malice of Satan has possessd our foes, when they have recourse to secret poison, assassanation and every wicked art that Hell can Musture, I own my self allarmd and my fears sometimes overpower me. But I commit you to the great  and protecter of the just, and trust in him that we shall meet and rejoice together, in spight of all the Malice of Earth and Hell. I hope before this time that Bass has arrived with your Horses, and that you are  to return to your own State. How anxiously do I expect you. On Monday I return to my own habitation with our Little Charles who is weak and feeble, and who wants the air and excercise of the Country to restore him. The Little flock have all left me but Him. Mrs. Cranch came into Town yesterday and carried out Nabby and Tommy, the Dr. would not consent to Charles going till Monday. His are but just cleverly turnd. Your Worthy Parent mett them,Mrs. Cranch writes me, upon their return and weept for joy to see them returnedagain. I have often pittied her anxiety which I know has been great upon this occasion. My own dear Mother is saved all she would have felt. My Unkle  [Quincy] has been a parent to us, with us every week, anxious to the greatest Degree about you,solisitious about your return, declared he would sit of for you himself if Bass would not come immediately. Mr. A did not get here till the 27 of the month, not till I had engaged your Horses and they were ready to come away. In the Letter by Him you say you wonder whether the  have thought of doing any thing for you, at which I was a Little surprizd. When I was at   Coll. [Warren ]mentiond some accounts which were left with Him upon which a committe was orderd but hethey [illegible]   never got them to do any thing. Said  [Cushing] had got all His setled and he reminded them of that, but nothing had been done. He further said that a Member from  Road Island wrote to Him to know what was given to the Delegates here and he asked Cr--g who told him that they were allowd 12s.pr. day and their expences. 18 was allowd at  Road Island to theirs. I replied that it must be something which had been lately done for I knew nothing of it. He said no he understood C---g that it had been allowed from the first, that is from last April twelve month. I however believed that you had never Received any thing more than your expences tho I could not absolutely say. This I know they will be very willing you should  for them as long as your Health and Strength will last, and when they are intirely exausted you may provide for yourself and family as you can. This is a  Morning. I see it with joy, and I hope thankfullness. I came here with all my treasure of children, have passd thro one of the most terible Diseases to which humane Nature is subject, and not one of us is wanting. I should go home with a much lighter  Heart if I had heard from you. I wish you would not miss a Post whilst you tarry tho you write no more than that you are well. In the Course of the week past we have had many reports of Battles at  New York, none of which gain credit.  peice of Trechery is come to light and as it is in the Military way I hope an Example will be made of the Wretch. What Blindness, what infatuation to suffer the Mayor of the city after having proved himself such a rascel and villan to go at large. To err upon the Leniant Hand is best no doubt, but to suffer such crimes to go unpunished is offensive in the sight of Heaven I doubt not. Little  stands by and sends Duty to Pappa, says Mamma did you get any Letters a Saturday? No. Then why do you write Mamma.  "

","Last  I left the Town of  Boston, underwent the operation of a smoaking at the lines and arrived at my Brother Cranchs where we go for purification; there I tarried till wedensday, and then came Home, which seem'd greatly endeard to me by my long absence. I think I never felt greater pleasure at comeing Home after an absence in my Life. Yet I felt a vacuum in my Breast and sent a Sigh to  [Philadelphia]. I long'd for a dear Friend to rejoice with me. Charlly is Banished yet, I keep him at his Aunt Cranch's out of the way of those who have not had the Distemper, his Arm has many Scabs upon it which are yet very soar. He is very weak and sweats a nights prodigiously. I am now giving him the Bark. He recoverd  [illegible]   very fast considering how ill he was. I pitty your anxiety and feel sorry that I wrote you when he was so Bad, but I knew not how it might turn with Him, had it been otherways than well, it might have proved a greater Shock than to have known that he was ill. This Night our good  came from Town and brought me  yours of August 20 ,  21 ,  25 ,  27  and  28th  for all of which I most sincerely thank you. I have felt uneasy to Hear from you. The Report of your being dead, has no doubt reach'd  you by Bass who heard enough of it before he came away. It took its rise among the Tories who as Swift said of himself ""By their fears betray their Hopes"" but How they should ever take it into their Heads that you was poisond at  New York a fortnight before that we heard any thing of that villans Zedwitz plan of poisoning the waters of the City, I cannot tell. I am sometimes ready to expect suspect that there is a communication between the Tories of every State, for they seem to know all news that is passing before tis known by the Whigs. We Have had many Stories concerning engagements upon  Long Island this week, of our Lines being forced and of our Troops retreating to  New York. we have not yet obtaind. All we can learn is that we have been unsuccessfull there; having Lost Many Men as prisoners among whom is Lord Sterling and General Sullivan. But if we should be defeated I think we shall not be conquered. A people fired like the Romans with Love of their Country and of Liberty, a zeal for the  Good, and a Noble Emulation of Glory, will not be disheartned or dispirited by a Succession of unfortunate Events. But like them may we learn by Defeat the power of becomeing invincible. I hope to Hear from you by every Post till you return. The Herbs you mention I never Received. I was upon a visit to Mrs. S. Adams about a week after Mr. Gerry , when She entertaind me with a very fine Dish of Green Tea. The Scarcity of the article made me ask her Where she got it. She replied her Sweet Heart sent it to her by Mr. Gerry. I said nothing, but thought my Sweet Heart might have been eaquelly kind considering the disease I was visited with, when and that  [tea] was recommended as a Bracer. A Little after you mention'd a couple of Bundles sent. I supposed one of them might contain the article but found they were Letters. How Mr. Gerry should make such a mistake I know not. I shall take the Liberty of sending for what is left of it tho I suppose it is half gone as it was very freely used. If you had mentiond a single Word of it in your Letter I should have immediately found out the mistake. Tis said that the Efforts of our Enemies will be to stop the communication between the colonies by taking possession of  Hudsons Bay. Can it be effected? The Milford frigate rides triumphant in our Bay, taking vessels every day, and  no Colony nor Continental vessel has yet attempted to hinder her. She mounts but 28 Guns but is one of the finest sailors in the British Navy. They complain we have not weighty mettle enough and I suppose truly. The Rage for privateering is as great here as any where and I believe the success has been as great. It will not be in my power to write you so regularly as when I was in Town. I shall not  doing it once a week. If you come home the Post Road you must inquire for Letters where ever the Post sit out from. Tis Here a very General time of Health. I think  near a twelve month since the pestilance raged here. I fear your being seazd with a fever, tis very prevalant I hear where you are. I pray God preserve you and return you in Health. The Court will not accept your Resignation, they will appoint Mr. Dalton and Dana to releave you. I am most affectionately Yours. "
Sepbr. 15 1776,"I have been so much engaged this week with company that,  I never cease to think of you I have not had leisure to write to you. It has been High Court week with us, judge  [Cushing] and Lady kept here, the judges all dined with me one day and the Bar an other day. The Court sit till Saturday Night, and then were obliged to continue many causes. The people seem to be pleased and gratified at seeing justice returning into its old regular channel again. I this week received two Letters, one dated  july 27  and   july 29th . Where they have been these two months I cannot conceive, I hear of an other by the Express but have not yet been able to find it. I write now not knowing where to direct to you, whether you are in the American Senate or on Board the British fleet is a matter of uncertainty. I hear to day that you are one of a committee sent by Congress to hold a conference with Lord How. Some say to negotiate an exchange of General Sulivan, others say you are charged with other matters. May you be wise as Serpents. I wish to hear from you, the  28 of August  was the last date. I may have Letters at the Post office. The Town is not yet clear of the small Pox which makes it dificult for me to get a conveyance from there, unless I send on purpose. I only write now to let you know that we are all well, anxiously longing for your return.  As this is a child of chance I do not  to say any thing more than that I am Sincerely Yours.  "
"Braintree  Sepbr. 20 1777  [i.e. 1776]
","I sit down this Evening to write you, but I hardly know what to think about your going to  N.Y. -- The Story has been told so many times, and with circumstances so  that I with others have given some heed  [to] it tho my not hearing any thing of it from you leaves me at a loss. Yours of  4  came to hand last Night, our Worthy unkle is a constant attendant upon the Post office for me and brought it me. Yours of  5  came to Night to   [Braintree] and was left as directed with the Cannister. Am sorry you gave yourself so much trouble about them. I got about half you sent me by Mr. Gerry. Am much obliged to you, and hope to have the pleasure of making the greater part of it for you. Your Letter damp't my Spirits; when I had no expectation of your return till December, I endeavourd to bring my mind to acquiess in the too painfull Situation, but I have now been in a state of Hopefull expectation. I have recond the days since Bass went away a hundred times over, and every Letter expected to find the day set for your return. But now I fear it is far distant. I have frequently been told that the communication would be cut of and that you would not be ever able to return. Sometimes I have been told so by those who really  it might be so, with  Malicious pleasure. Sometimes your timid folks have apprehended that it would be so. I wish any thing would bring you nearer. If there is really any danger I should think you would remove. Tis a plan your Enemies would rejoice to see accomplished, and will Effect if it lies in their power. I am not apt to be intimidated you know. I have given as little heed to that and a thousand other Bug Bear reports as . I have slept as soundly since my return not withstanding all the Ghosts and hobgoblings, as ever I did in my life. Tis true I never close my Eyes at night till I have been to   [Philadelphia], and my first visit in the morning is there. How  are the world! They tell me they Heard you was dead with as little sensibility as a stock or a stone, and I have now got to be provoked at it, and can hardly help snubing the person who tells me so. The Story of your being upon this conference at  New  came in a Letter as I am told from R. T.  [Paine] to his Brother in Law  [ [Greenleafe]]. Many very many have been the conjectures of the Multitude upon it. Some have supposed the War concluded, the Nation setled, others an exchange of prisoners, others a reconsiliation with  Brittain &c. &c. I cannot consent to your tarrying  much longer. I know your Health must greatly suffer from so constant application to Buisness and so little excercise. Besides I shall send you word by and by as Regulus'es steward did, that whilst you are engaged in the Senate your own domestick affairs require your presence at Home, and that your wife and children are in Danger of wanting Bread. If the Senate of  America will take care of us, as the Senate of  Rome did of the family of Regulus, you may serve them again, but unless you return what little property you possess will be lost. In the first place the House at  Boston is going to ruin. When I was there I hired a Girl to clean it, it had a cart load of Dirt in it. I speak within Bounds. One of the chambers was used to keep poultry in, an other sea coal, and an other salt. You may conceive How it look'd. The House is so exceeding damp being shut up, that the floors are mildewd, the sealing falling down, and the paper mouldy and falling from the walls. I took care to have it often opened and aird whilst I tarried in Town. I put it into the best state I could. In the next place, the Lighter of which you are or should be part owner is lying rotting at the wharf. One year more without any care and she is worth nothing. You have no Bill of Sale, no right to convey any part of her should any person appear to purchase her.  The Pew I let, after having paid a tax for the repairs of the meeting House. As to what is here under my more immediate inspection I do the best I can with it, but it will not at the high price  is, pay its way. I know the weight of  cares lye so heavey upon you that I have been loth to mention your own private ones. The Best accounts we can collect from  New York assure us that our Men fought valiantly. We are no ways  here, we possess a Spirit that will not be conquerd. If our Men are all drawn of and we should be attacked, you would find a Race of Amazons in  America. But I trust we shall yet tread down our Enemies. I must  you to remember me often. I never think your Letters half long enough. I do not complain.  I have no reason to, no one can boast of more Letters than Your "
Sepbr. 21 1774  [i.e. 1776],"My dear Sir I wrote you last Night till my Eyes were almost out by the post, but Mr. Eliot has taken pains to send me word that he would carry a Letter for me, and I cannot omit writing a few lines  tis only to say that I am well, and to inquire how you do? I have a thousand fears for your Health. How is poor Mr. Barrel, is he gone, or does he yet live? This Month twelve month was attended with so many melancholy Scenes, that my Heart Bleeds afresh at the recollection. The Image of my Dear Mother seems ever before me, and fresh to my memory. I felt more than common depression of spirits the other day when I  the House, nor could I enjoy myself whilst I stay'd, a Train of melancholly Ideas forced themselves upon me and made me very unhappy. My Father enjoys better Health than he has for many year, he possesses a  old age. He call'd here the other day comeing of a journey to dine with me having ride forty miles before dinner. I askd him if he was not fatigued. No says he with his useuel sprightlyness thats a triffell for me one so young as I am. Tis a much  Season than Last year. Our Neighbour Feild is just gone in a consumption, he has been upon the decline ever since the Spring. Our Worthy Brother and Sister  are well in Health but a good deal embaressed what course to take. Ever since the Removal of the army and the opening of  Boston he has not had half Buisness enough to employ him. I am very loth he should remove, but I know not what he will do. He wants much to purchase a little farm in the Country, but he would I think do better in Town. He had considerable Buisness there, when he had the small Pox. I had something to say  you about the state of Harvard Colledge, but I omit it at present. -- The Portsmouth Brigg Ship has been waiting for Guns these six weeks. Had an unkle of ours and several other merchants I could mention had the care of her I dare say she would have long ago had Guns. Private adventurours can get Guns even for large Briggs. -- The Boston formerly the Zechary Baily which was taken as a prize and bought by private persons has been fitted out, her Guns made and purchased long since that the other ought to have saild. So it is we dream away opportunities by misplaceing .  Adieu, Yours.  "
Sepbr. 23 1776,"There are  times when I feel such an uneasiness, such a restlessness, as neither company, Books, family Cares or any other thing will remove, my Pen is my only pleasure, and writing to you the composure of my mind. I feel that agitation this Evening, a degree of Melancholy has  my mind, whether owing to the anxiety I feel for the fate of our Arms at  New York, and the apprehensions I have for your Health and Safety. We Have so many  and reports that tis imposible to know what to Credit. We are this Evening assurd that there has been a field Battle between a detachment of our Army commanded by General Miflin and a Detachment of British Troops in which the Latter were defeated. An other report says that we have been obliged to Evacuate the city and leave our cannon, Baggage &c. &c. This we cannot credit, we will not Believe it. Tis a most critical day with us. Heaven Crown our arms with Success. Did you ever expect that we should hold  Long Island? And if that could not be held, the city of  New York must lie at their mercy. If they command  New York can they cut of the communication between the Colonies?  I sufferd much last winter yet I had rather be in a situation where I can collect the Truth, than at a distance where I am distressd by a thousand vague reports --  I write you an abundance, do you read it all? Your last Letters have been very short. Have you buried, stifled or  all the -- I wont ask the question you must find out my meaning if you can. I cannot help  at your caution in never subscribeing a Letter, yet frank it upon the outside where you are obliged to write your name. I hope I have a Letter by Saturdays Post. You say you are sometimes , you can tell then How I feel. I endeavour to write once a week. Poor Barrel I see by the paper is dead. So is our  Feild.  "

","Not since the  5th of   have I had one line from you which makes me very uneasy. Are you all this time confering with his Lordship, is there no communication? or are the post Riders all dismissd. Let the cause be which it will, not hearing from you has given me much uneasiness. We seem to be kept in a total Ignorance of affairs at  York. I hope you at Congress are more . Who fell, who wounded, who prisoner or their numbers is as undetermined as it was the day after the Battle. If our Army is in ever so critical a state I wish to know it, and the worst of it -- if all America are to be ruind and undone by a pack of Cowards and knaves, I wish to know it. Pitiable is the Lot of their commander. Caesars tenth Leigion never was forgiven. We are told for Truth that a Regiment of Yorkers refused to quit the city and that an other Regiment behaved like a pack of Cowardly villans by quitting their posts. If they are unjustly censured it is for want of proper inteligance. I am sorry to see a Spirit so venal prevailing . When our Men were drawn out for  Canady a very large Bounty was given them, and now an other call  [is made] upon us no one will go without a large Bounty tho only for two months, and each  Town seem to think their Honour engaged in giving outbiding one an other. The province pay is forty shilings. In addition to that this Town voted to make it up six pounds. They then drew out the persons most unlikely to go and they are obliged to give 3 pounds to Hire a Man. Some pay the whole fine ten pounds; forty men are now draughted from this Town, more than one half from 50 to 16teen are now in the Service. This method of conducting will create a General uneasiness in the Continental Army; I hardly think you can be sensible how much we are thind in this province. The rage for privateering is as great here as . Vast Numbers are employd in that way. If it is necessary to make any more draughts upon us the women must Reap the Harvests. I am willing to do my part. I believe I could gather Corn and Husk it, but I should make a poor figure at diging Potatoes. There has been a report that a fleet was seen in our Bay yesterday. I cannot conceive from whence, nor do I believe the story. Tis said you have been upon  Staten Island to hold your conference, a little odd that I have never Received the least intimation of it from you. Did you think I should be allarmd? Dont you know me better than to think me a  Coward? I hope you will write me every thing concerning this affair. I have a great curiosity to know the result. As to  nothing is yet done about it. The Church is opened here every Sunday, and the king prayed for as usual in open defiance to Congress. Parker of  Boston is more discreet and so is Sargent. You have wrote me once or twice to know whether your Brother inclined to go into the Service. I think he  declines it. As to mine I have not heard any thing from him since his application to Court. Natll. Belcher goes Capt. and Tertias Bass Lieut. from this Town. They March tomorrow. Poor  we have lost him with a nerveous fever, he died a fryday. A great loss to this Town a man of so interprizing a temper, more Especially when we are so destitute of them. I should be obliged to you if you would direct Bass to Buy me a  Barcelona Hankerchief and 2 oz. of Thread  18. Mr. Gerry said Goods were 5 pr. cent dearer here than with you, and by the way I hope you are not charged Eaquelly dear for the last Canister as for the first, the first is the Best of Hyson the other very Good Suchong. If the next post does not bring me a Letter I think I will leave of writing, for I shall not believe you get mine. PS Master  has become post rider from  Boston to   [Braintree]. "
Janry. 26 1777,"Tis a Great Grief to me that I know not how to write nor where to send to you. I know not of any conveyance. I risk this by Major  who promisses to take what care he can to get it to you. I have Received 3 Letters from you since you left me, 2 from H--d  and one from  D--m  [Dedham]. Tis a satisfaction to hear tho only by a line. We are told the most  things by use become less so. I cannot say that I find the truth of the observation verified. I am sure no seperation was ever so painfull to me as the last. Many circumstances concur to make it so -- the distance and the difficulty of communication, the Hazards which if not real, my immagination represents so, all conspire  [to] make me anxious, as well as what I need not mention. I wish to Hear often from you and when a conveniant opportunity offers let me know how you like your waiter. Many reports have been circulated since you went away concerning him none of which I regard as I find no proof to support them. One is that he is a deserted Regular, a Spy &c. I find  all Suspicion or else told with a design to make me uneasy, but it has not that Effect. The family are all well, and desire Pappa would write to them.I rejoice in our late Successes. Heaven grant us a continuation of them.  desires to be rememberd to you. I long to hear of your arrival and to get one Letter from  B--e . The Situation will be new and afford me entertainment by an account of it. At all times remember in the tenderest manner her whose happiness depends upon your Welfare,  "
Febry 8 1777,"Before this time I fancy you at your journeys end; I have  you the Season has been a continued cold. I have heard  from you than I ever did in any of your former journeys, it has greatly releaved my mind under its anxiety. I have received six Letters from you, and have the double pleasure of hearing you are well, and that your Thoughts are often turnd this way. I have wrote once by Major Rice. Two Gentlemen set of for  B--e  monday or twesday and have engaged to take this Letter. I feel under so many restraints when I sit down to write that I scarcly know what to say to you. The conveyance of Letters is so precarious that I shall not trust any thing of consequence to them untill we have more regular passes. Indeed very little of any consequence has taken place since you left us. We seem to be in a state of Tranquility; rather too much so. I wish there was a little more Zeal  to join the Army.  Nothing now but the regulating Bill engrosses their attention. The merchant scolds, the farmer growls, and every one seems wroth that he cannot grind his neighbour. We have a report here said to come in two private Letters that a Considerable Battle has taken place in  Brunswick in which we have taken 15000 prisoners. I cannot credit so Good News. The Letters are said to be without date. I rejoice so much when I only receive a few lines from you, just to hear you are well, that I think I shall give  pleasure by writing to  you,tho I cannot say I have enjoyed so much Health since you left me as I did in the begining of winter. Johnny has had an ill turn, but is better. I beg you would write by every opportunity, and if you cannot send so often as you used write and Let them lay by till you make a . -- What is become of the Farmer, many reports are abroad to his disadvantage.

"Febry 12, 1777","Mr. Bromfield was so obliging as to write me Word that he  a journey to the Southern States, and would take perticuliar care of a Letter to you. I rejoice in so good an opportunity of letting you know that I am well as usual, but that I have not yet got reconciled to the great distance between us. I have many melancholy Hours when the best company is urksome to me, and solitude the greatest happiness I can enjoy. I wait most earnestly for a Letter to bring me the welcome tidings of your safe arrival. I hope you will be very  and let me know how you are after your fatigueing journey. How you are accommodated. How you like  Maryland. What state of mind you find the C--ss  [Congress] in, and what may be communicated relative to their proceedings. You know how little intelegance we received during your stay here with regard to what was passing there or in the Army. We know no better now, all communication seems to be embaressed. I got more knowledge from a Letter wrote to you from your Namesake which I received since you left me, than I had before obtaind since you left P--a  [Philadelphia]. I find by that Letter that six Hessian officers together with Col. Campel had been offerd in exchange for General Lee. I fear he receives very ill Treatment, the terms were not complied with as poor Campbel finds. He was much surprized when the officers went to take him, and beg'd to know what he had been guilty of? They told him it was no crime of his own but they were obliged tho reluctantly to commit him to  Concord jail in consequence of the ill treatment of General Lee. He then beged to know how long  his confinement was to last, they told him that was imposible for them to say, since it lay wholy in the power of General How to determine it. By a vessel from  Bilboa we have accounts of the safe arrival of  in France ten days before She saild; a French Gentleman who came passenger says we may rely upon it that 200 thousand Russians will be here in the Spring. A Lethargy seems to have  our Country Men. I hear no more of molessting or routing those troops at  Newport than of attacking Great Britain. We just begin to talk of raising our Men for the Standing Army. I wish to know whether the reports may be  Credited of the Southern Regiments being full? You will write me by the Bearer of this Letter, to whose care you may venture to commit any thing you have Liberty to Communicate. I have wrote you twice before this, hope you have received them.

","We have had very severe weather almost ever since you left us. About the middle of  came a snow of a foot and half deep upon. a Level which made it fine going for about 10 day's when a snow storm succeeded with a High wind and banks 5 and 6 feet high. I do not remember to have seen the Roads so obstructed since my remembrance; there has been no passing since except for a Horse. I Have wrote you 3 Letters since your absence but whether you have ever received one of them I know not. The Post office has been in such a Situation that there has been no confiding in it, but I hear  is come to put it upon a better footing. We know not what is passing with you nor with the Army, any more than if we lived with the Antipodes. I want a Bird of passage. It has given me great pleasure to find by your Letters which I have received that your Spirits are so Good, and that your Health has not  by your tedious journey. Posterity who are to reap the Blessings, will scarcly be able to conceive the Hardships and Sufferings of their Ancesstors. --  ""But tis a day of suffering says the Author of the Crisis, and we ought to expect it. What we contend for is worthy the affliction we may go through. If we get but Bread to eat and any kind of rayment to put on, we ought not only to be contented, but thankfull. What are the inconveniencies of a few Months or years to the Tributary bondage of ages?"" [AA is quoting from Thomas Paine, The American Crisis.]  These are Sentiments which do Honour to Humane Nature. We have the Debates of Parliment by which it appears there are Many who apprehend a War inevitable and foresee the precipice upon which they stand. We have a report Here that Letters are come to Congress from administration, and proposals of a treaty, and some other Stories fit to amuse children, but Experienced Birds are not to be caught with chaff. What is said of the english nation by Hume in the Reign of Harry the 8th may very aptly be applied to them now, that they  are so thoroughly subdued that like Eastern Slaves they are inclined to admire even those acts of tyranny and violence which are exercised over themselves at their own expence. Thus far I wrote when I received a  Letter dated  10 , favourd by but it was a mistake it was not favourd by any body, and not being frank'd cost me a Dollor. The Man who deliverd it to my unkle brought him a Letter at the same time for which he paid the same price. If it had containd half as much as I wanted to know I would not have grumbld, but you do not tell me How you do, nor what accommodations you have, which is of more consequence to me than all the discriptions of cities, states and kingdoms in the world. I wish the Men of War better imployd than in taking flower vessels since it creates a Temporary famine Here, if I would give a Guiney for a pound of flower I dont think I could purchase it. There is such a Cry for Bread in the Town of  Boston as I suppose was never before Heard, and the Bakers deal out but a loaf a day to the largest families. There is such a demand for Indian and Rye, that a Scarcity will soon take place in the Country. Tis now next to imposible to purchase a Bushel of Rye. In short since the late act there is very little selling. The meat that is carried to market is miserabley poor, and so little of it that many people say they were as well supplied in the Seige. I am  of my Country men. The Merchant and farmer are both alike. Some there are who have virtue enough to adhere to it, but more who evade it. I have this day Received a most  packet favourd by Mr. Hall, for which I return you my most hearty thanks, and which contains much amusement, and gave me much pleasure. Rejoice with you in your agreable situation,tho I cannot help wishing you nearer. Shall I tell you how near? You have not given me any politicks tho, have you so much of them that you are sick of them? I have some thoughts of opening a political correspondence with your namesake. He is much more communicative than you are, but I must agree with him to consider me as part of one of the Members of Congress. You must know that since your absence a Letter  for you from him fell into my Hands. You make some inquiries which tenderly affect me. I think upon the whole I have enjoyed as much Health as I ever did in the like situation -- a situation I do not repine at,  a constant remembrancer of an absent Friend, and excites sensations of tenderness which are better felt than expressd. Our Little ones are well and often talk and wish for --  desires I would write a Letter for him which I have promissed to do. Your Mamma tenderly inquires after you. I cannot do your Message to B -- y  [Betsy] since the mortification I endure at the mention of it is so great that I have never changd a word with her upon the subject, altho preparations are making for house keeping. The ordination is the 12th of this month. I would not make an exchange with her for the mountains of  Mexico and  Peru. She has forfeited all her character with me and the world  for taste &c. All her acquaintance stand amazd. -- An Idea of 30 years and unmarried is sufficent to make people do fiery unacountable things. Thank Heaven my Heart was early fix'd and Never deviated. The early impression has for succeeding years been thering strength, and will out last the Brittle frame that contains it -- tis a spark of Celestial fire and will burn with Eternal vigor.  Heaven preserve and return in safety the dearest of Friends to His I have just now heard that one of my 's flower vessels arrived safe yesterday, at which there is great joy. You can scarcly conceive the distress there has been for Bread, it is but a mouthfull. Flower is sold at 4.16 per Barrell not withstanding what has been done. Indeed the and the high price it bears with you, no person can send for it without sinking half the Cargo. I see by the news papers you sent me that Spado   is lost. I mourn for him. If you know any thing of His Master pray Let me hear, what treatment he meets with, where he is confined &c. A considerable number of our 3 Months Militia have , deserted, some belonging both to this Town and Weymouth, and they say others from other Towns. The Story they tell is this, that a great number of the standing Army were under inoculation for the small pox, and they were obliged to do duty where they were constantly exposed to it, that they would have been innoculated but as they had so short a time to tarry were not allowd to, that they applied to their Col. for leave to come of but could not obtain it, that those who had it in the natural way 4 out  [of] 5 died with it, and that it was death for any of the Militia to be innoculated. This does not seem to be likely but is told by all of them. What will be the consequence I know not. I hear of but a few in this Town who are inlisted for the standing Army. Suppose they will be drawn soon.  "
March 23 1777,"I have a very good opportunity of writing to you by Major Ward, who sits of tomorrow morning. I most sincerely rejoice at your return to  Philadelphia. I shall now be able to hear from you every week or fortnight. You have had journeying this winter and  exercise for a year. We have very  Intelligence from  France which suppose will be communicated to you before this reaches you. Our proportion of Men from this State will be sent along soon, our Continental vessels are not yet ready. I have been told that the person who had the care of Building MacNeals Ship, has since built a 20 Gun Ship which has been at Sea some time. Why should a pigmy Build a World? I yesterday received  yours of the 7 of March , with a Bundle of news papers, for which I am much obliged. Nor would I omit returning my thanks for the  of flower sent by my unkles vessel. I know not a more acceptable present you could have sent, that whole cargo sold for 2.10 per hundred. There is not a Bushel of Rye to be had within 60 miles of this Town. The late act will annihilate every article we have, unless they  will punish the Breaches of it. This person has nothing and the other has nothing, no Coffe, no Sugar, no flax, no wool. They have been so much accustomed to see acts made and repeald that they are endeavouring by every art to make this share the same fate. If you have not settled your account with Mr. Barrells Estate the next time I write will  one I find in your Book against it. There appears one settlement, but since that there is an account which will amount to near 10 pounds. You mention a Resignation of an office. I have not heard it , believe tis not much known as yet. As to news we have none I think. All our Friends are well and desire to be . I suffer much from my Eyes -- otherways am well as usual -- and most affectily.  Yours,  "
March 26 1777,"I this morning Received  yours of March 7   by Dr. Jackson. I rejoice to hear you are so comfortable. Col. Palmer informd me a Sunday that he is going to morrow as far as  the Jersies being one of a Committe sent by our assembly to know of the General what proportion of Continental Troops will be allowed to this State; and does not know but he shall be obligd to proceed as far as  Philadelphia. I venture to write by Him as he will take good care of a Letter tho he should not go farther than the jersies. -- I fear you will think me neglegent in not writing oftner, but till lately I dare not trust the post office, have sent wholy by private Hands. This Letter is but the sixth that I have wrote since you left me,tho I have to acknowledg the Receipt of 20 from you. We have no news this way except that Manly  this Morning.I believe you will not find it difficult to procure Money since you have offerd 6 per cent. I was mentioning the other day to a certain Gentleman in this Town that Congress had agreed to give that, an unusual pleasure lighted up his Countanance immediately, and he instantly replied, they shall have all mine immediately, I only waited for that. You know the Character so perfectly well, that the Speach needs no comment. You mention my  a Ticket. I am determined to do it if I find my self able, after having paid the Rate bill, which tis said will amount to near 30 pounds, so that I must be very parsimonious. I met with the Misfortune of loosing a Cow upon the Ice this winter, Ruggles by name, and  [having] to make her place good purchased an other which cost me 5 pound's. -- You know I have ever made it a Rule not to involve an absent Friend in debt. I have at last Let the House in Q--n  S--t  [Street] to a Good Tenant at £22 per annum, when he gets in, but a very odd affair happend after it was engaged to him. I advertised the House in G's  [Gill's] paper, and supposing any person would chuse to see it, before they engaged it, desired him to Let them know where the key was to be found. Accordingly Mr. W--s  [Willis] the printer applied to me for the House and I Let it to  [him]. Upon his return to Boston and applying to Mr. G--ll for the key he found the famous Dr. W--ship had taken it and would not deliver it to him, tho He let him know that he had hired the House of me, and this same Genious had the Confidence to remove his family into the House without either writing to me or applying to me in any shape whatever, and then upon the other insisting upon having the House, he wrote to Let me know that he had moved in and would pay his Rent Quarterly, and that he supposed Mr. G--ll had the Letting of the House, which was absolutely falce for Mr. G--ll never gave him any leave, and had no right to. In Reply to him I let him know that I had Let the House to Mr. W--s, that I could do nothing about it, that I had nothing more to do with it than with any other House in Town. He and Mr. W--s must settle the matter between themselves. In this Time Mr. W--s had taken advice upon it and was determind to prosecute him; tis near a Month since they have been disputing the Matter, and the Dr. finding Mr. W--s determind has promised if he will not put him to farther Trouble to remove in about a week. If you should have an opportunity pray purchase me a Box of Dr. Ryans Wafers for worms, and send them. T--y  is much troubled with them, has lost most all his flesh, you would scarcly know him. Tis now 26 of March and exceeding cold  the snow is all gone. Pray what is become of the F--r  -- has he sunk into forgetfullness. We can not learn any thing about him. Poor General L-e  [Lee] how does he fare?  "
 [April 1777],"The young folks desire Mamma to return thanks for their Letters which they will properly notice soon. It would have grieved you if you had seen your youngest Son stand by his Mamma and when she  out to the others their Letters, he inquired for one, but none appearing he stood in silent grief with the Tears running down his face, nor could he be pacified till I gave him one of mine. -- Pappa does not Love him he says so well as he does Brothers, and many comparisons were made to see whose Letters were the longest.  "
April 2 1777,"I sit down to write  I feel very Languid; the approach of Spring unstrings my nerves, and the South winds have the same Effect upon me which Brydon says the Siroce winds have upon the inhabitants of Sicily. It gives the vapours, blows away all their gaiety and spirits and gives a degree of Lassitude both to the Body and mind, which renders them absolutely incapable of performing their usual functions. He adds that it is not  that it should produce these Effects upon a phlegmatic English constitution; but that he had just had an Instance that all the Mercury of  France must sink under the weight of this Horrid Leaden Atmosphere. A smart Parisian marquis came here, (to  Naples) about ten days ago; he was so full of animal Spirits that the people thought him mad. He never remained a moment in the same place; but at their grave conversations used to skip from room to room with such amazing elasticity that the Italians swore he had got springs in his shoes. I met him this morning walking with the step of a philosopher; a smelling bottle in his hand, and all his vivacity extinguishd. I asked what was the matter? ""Ah! mon ami,"" said he ""je m'ennui a la mort; moi, qui n'ai jamais squ L'ennui. Mais cet execrable vent m'accable; et deux jours de plus, et je me pend."" The natives themselves do not suffer less than strangers. A Neapolitian lover avoids his Mistress with the utmost care in the time of the Siroce, the indolence it inspires, is almost  to extinguish every passion. Thus much for the Siroce or South East wind of Naples, which I am persuaided bears a near resemblance to our Southerly Winds, and thus does the happiness of Man depend apon a blast of wind. I think the Author of common Sense some where says that no persons make use of quotations but those who are destitute of Ideas of their own. this may not att all times be true, yet I am willing to acknowledg it at present. Yours of the 7 of March  received by the Post. Tis said here that  is meditating an other visit to  Philadelphia, if so I would advise to taking down all the doors that the panels may not suffer for the future. Tis said here that General Washington has but 8 thousand troops with him. Can it be  true? that we have but 12 hundred at  Ticonderogo. I know not who has the care of raising them here, but this I know we are very dilitory about it. All the troops which were station'd upon  Nantasket and at  Boston are dismissd this week so that we are now very fit to receive an Enemy; [illegible]   I have heard some talk of routing the Enemy at Newport, but if any thing was designd against them, believe tis wholy laid aside. Nobody seems to consider them as dangerous or indeed to care any thing about them. Where is ? We hear nothing of him. The Church doors were shut up last Sunday in consequence of a presentment, a farewell Sermon preached and much weeping and wailing. Persecuted  be sure but not for righteousness sake. The conscientious parson had takeTaken an oath upon the Holy Evangelist to pray for His most Gracious majesty as his Sovereign Lord, and having no Father Confesser to absolve him, he could not omit it without breaking his oath. Who is to have the command at Ticondorogo? Where is General Lee? How is he treated? Is there a scarcity of Grain in  Philadelphia. How is  sold there by the Hundred? Are there any stocking weavers needles to be had. Hardwick has been with me, to desire me to write to you, to send Turner to procure 500 and to beg of you to enclose to me 50 or a Hundred at a time as he is in great want of them. Says Turner knows what sort he wants, and if you will send word what the price is he will pay it, and make me a present of the best pair of Brants he gets this year. He is full of work, but almost out of needles. We are just  farming Buisness. I wish most sincerely you was Here to amuse yourself with it, and to unbend your mind from the cares of State. I hope your associates are more to your mind than  they have been in times past. I suppose you will be joind this month by two from this state.  "
Monday April 7. 1777,"I hope to receive some Letters from you this week, the date of the last was the  7 of March  and now  the 7 of April. I cannot suppose according to your usual practice but you must have wrote several times since; I sent a Letter to the post office a Saturday, but yesterday hearing of an express I thought to write a few lines by it, just to tell you that the family are well as usual, that I visit you almost every night, or you me, but wakeing the agreable delusion vanishes -- ""like the Baseless fabrick of a vision."" I have nothing new to write you. The present Subject of discourse is the unfortunate Daughter of Dr. C--r , who having indiscreetly and foolishly married a Stranger, after finding him a Sot, has the additional misery of finding herself the wife of a  [illegible]   married Man and the Father of 5 children who are all living. About 3 weeks after he saild for the  West Indias a Letter came to Town directed to him which was deliverd to her, and proved to be from his wife, who after condoling with him upon his misfortune in being taken prisoner, Lets him know that she with her 5 children are well, and to add to   mortification tis said her complexion is not so fair as the American Laidies. I most sincerely  her unfortunate Father, who having but two children has found himself unhappy in both. This last Stroke is worse than death. Let me hear from you by the return of this express, and by every other opportunity. My Brother is going Captain of Marines on board MacNeal. I hear there has been an inquiry at the Counsel Board why he has not  before? and that the blame falls upon the continental Agent. I suppose you are in Bloom in your climate whilst we are yet hovering over a fire and shivering with the cold.  Adieu. Yours with an affection that knows no bounds,  "
"April 17, 1777","Your obliging  of  March 14 ,  16  and  22 , have received, and most sincerely thank you for them. I know not How I should support an absence already tedious, and many times attended with melancholy reflections, if it was not for so frequently hearing from you. That is a consolation to me, tho a cold comfort in a winters Night. As the Summer advances I have many anxieties, some of which I should not feel or at least should find them greatly alleviated if you could be with me. But as that is a Satisfaction I know I must not look for, (tho I have a good mind to hold You to your promise since some  circumstances were really upon that condition) I must summon all the Phylosophy I am mistress of since what cannot be help'd must be endured.  a Lady for whom I know you had a great respect died yesterday to the inexpressible Grief of her Friends. She was deliverd of a Son or Daughter I know not which yesterday week, a mortification in her Bowels occasiond her death. Every thing of this kind naturally shocks a person in similar circumstances. How great the mind that can overcome the fear of Death! How anxious the Heart of a parent who looks round upon a family of young and helpless children  and thinks of leaving them to a World full of snares and temptations which they have neither discretion to foresee, nor prudence to avoid. But I will quit  Subject least it should excite painfull Sensations in a Heart that I would not willingly wound. You give me an account in one of your Letters of the removal of your Lodgings. The extravagance of Board is greater there than here  here every thing is at such prices as was not ever before known. Many articles are not to be had tho at ever so great a price. Sugar, Molasses, Rum, cotton wool, Coffe, chocolate, cannot all be consumed. Yet there are none, or next to none to be sold, perhaps you may procure a pound at a time, but no more. I have sometimes stoped 15 or 20 Butchers in a day with plenty of meat but not a mouthfull to be had unless I would give 4 pence per pound and a pence per pound for bringing. I have never yet indulged them and am determined I will not whilst I have a mouthfull of salt meat, to Eat, but the act is no more regarded now than if it had never been made and has only this Effect I think, that it makes  people worse than they would have been without it. As to cloathing of any sort for myself or family I think no more of purchaseing any than if they were to live like Adam and Eve in innocence. I seek wool and flax and can work willingly with my Hands, and  my Household are not cloathed with fine linnen nor scarlet, they are cloathed with what is perhaps full as Honorary, the plain and decent manufactory of my own family, and tho I do not abound, I am not in want. I have neither poverty nor Riches but food which is convenient for me and a Heart to be thankfull and content that in such perilous times so large a share of the comforts of life are allotted to me. I have a large Share of Health to be  for, not only for myself but for my family. I have enjoyed as much Health since the small pox, as I have known in any year not with standing a paleness which has very near resembled a whited wall, but which for about 3 weeks past I have got the Better of.  and a clumsy figure make their appearence in so much that Master  John says, Mar, I never saw any body grow so fat as you do. I really think this Letter would make a curious figure if it should fall into the Hands of any person but yourself -- and pray if it comes safe to you, burn it.  But ever remember with the tenderest Sentiments her who knows no earthly happiness  to that of being tenderly beloved by her dearest Friend. "
April 20 1777,"The post is very Regular and faithfully brings me all your Letters I believe. If I do not write so often as you do be  that tis because I have nothing worth your acceptance to write. Whilst the Army lay this way I had constantly something by way of inteligance to write, of late there has been as general a state of Tranquility as if we had no contending Armies. There seems to be something prepairing against  Newport at last. If we are not wise too late it will be well. 2000 Militia are  to be Draughted for that place, and last week the independant Company Marchd very generally -- expect to tarry six weeks, till the Militia are collected. Your obliging  of various dates came safe to Hand last week, and contain a fine parcel of agreable inteligance for which I am much obliged and feel very important to have such a Bugget to communicate. As to the Town of  Boston I cannot give you any very  account of it. It seems to be really destitute of the Choice Spirits which once inhabited it. Tho I have not heard any perticuliar charges of Toryism against it, no doubt you had your inteligance from Better authority than I can name. I Have not been into Town since your absence nor do I desire to go till a better Spirit prevails.  If tis not Toryism,tis a Spirit of avarice, a Contempt of Authority, an inordinate Love of Gain, that prevails not only in Town, but every where I look or hear from. As to Dissapation, there was always enough of it, in the Town, but I believe not more now than when you left us. There is a general cry against the Merchants, against  &c. who tis said have created a partial Scarcity. That a Scarcity prevails of every article not only of Luxery, but even the necessaries of life is a certain fact.Every thing bears an exorbitant price. The act which for a while was in some measure regarded and stemed the torrent of oppression is now no more  [illegible]  Heeded than if it had never been made; Indian Corn at 5 shillings, Rye 11 and 12 shillings, but none scarcly to be had even at that price,Beaf 8 pence, veal 6 pence and 8 pence, Butter 1 & 6 pence; Mutton none, Lamb none, pork none, Sugar mean Sugar 4 per hundred, Molasses none, cotton wool none, Rum N.E. 8 shillings per Gallon,Coffe 2 & 6 per pound, Chocolate 3 shillings. What can be done? Will Gold and Silver remedy this Evil? By your accounts of Board, Horse keeping &c. I fancy you are not better of than we are Here. I live in hopes that we  see the most difficult time we have to experience. Why is Carolina so much better furnishd than any other State? and at so reasonable prices. I Hate to tell a Story unless I am fully  of every perticuliar. As it happned last Nightyesterday, and to day is Sunday have not been so fully informd as I could wish. About 11 o clock yesterday William Jackson, Dick Green, Harry Perkins, and Sergant of  Cape Ann and a Carry of  Charlstown were carted out of  Boston under the direction of joice junr. who was mounted on Horse back with a Red coat, a white Wig and a drawn Sword, with Drum and fife following; a Concourse of people to the amount of 500 followed. They proceeded as far as  Roxbury when he orderd the cart to be timpd up, then told them if they were ever catchd in Town again it should be at the expence of their lives. He then orderd his Gang to return which they did immediately without any disturbance. Whether they had been guilty of any new offence I cannot learn. Tis said that a week or two ago there was a publick auction at  Salem when these 5 Tories went down and bid up the articles to an enormous price, in consequence of which they were complaind of by the  Salem Committee. Two of them I  hear took refuge in this Town last Night. I believe we shall be the last State to assume . Whilst we Harbour such a number of designing Tories amongst us, we shall find goverment disregarded and every measure brought into contempt, by secretly undermineing and openly contemning them. We abound with designing Tories and Ignorant  [illegible]   avaricious Whigs. Have now  the crime of the carted Tories. It seems they have refused to take paper money and offerd their goods Lower for Silver than for paper -- Bought up articles at a dear rated, and then would not part with them for paper. Yesterday arrived 2 French vessels, one a 20 some say 36 Gun frigate -- dry goods and 400 Stands of Arms  said they contain. I believe I wrote you that Manly had saild, but it was only as far as  Cape Ann. He and Mack Neal  [McNeill] both lye at Anchor in the Harbour. "
May 6 1777,"Tis ten days I believe since I wrote you a Line, yet not ten minuts passes without thinking of you. Tis four Months wanting 3 days since we parted, every day of the time I have  the absence of my Friend, and felt a vacancy in my Heart which nothing, nothing can supply. In vain the Spring Blooms or the Birds sing, their Musick has not its formour melody, nor the Spring its usual pleasures. I look round with a melancholy delight and sigh for my absent partner. I fancy I see you worn down with Cares, fatigued with Buisness, and solitary amidst a multitude. And I think it probabal before this reaches you that you may be driven from the city by our Barbarous and Hostile foes, and the City  the fate of Charlestown and  Falmouth,  Norfolk and  Daunbury. So vague and uncertain are the accounts with regard to the Latter that I shall not pretend to mention them. Tis more than a week since the Event, yet we have no accounts which can be depended upon. I wish it may serve the valuable purpose of arousing our degenerated Country Men from that state of security and torpitude into which they seem to be sunk. I have been prevented writing for several days by company  Town. Since I wrote you I have received several Letters,  2 of the13 of April ,   one of the 19  and one of the 22 . Tho some of them were very short, I will not complain. I rejoice to hear from you tho you write but a line. Since the above we have some accounts of the affair at Daunbury and of the loss of General Wocester. That they had no more assistance tis said was owing to six expresses being stoped by the Tories. We shall never prosper till we fall upon some method to extirpate that Blood thirsty set of men.to Too much Lenity will prove our ruin. We have rumours too of an action at  Brunswick much to our advantage  but little credit is yet given to the report. I wish we may be able to meet them in the Feald, to encounter and Conquer so vile an Enemy. The two Continental frigates lie wind bound with 3 brigs of 20 Guns and some others who are all going out in company. We have had a very long season of cold rainy weather, and the trees are not yet out in , the wind has been a long time at East, and prevented the vessels from going out. -- I was mistaken in my Brothers going with MacNeal. He is going in the Tarter a vessel which mounts 24 Guns, is private property but sails with the Fleat. I cannot write you half so much as I would. I have left company because I would not loose an opportunity of sending this. The children are well. I cannot say that I am so well as I have been. The disorder I had in my Eyes has in some measure left them  but communicated itself all over me and turnd to the salt rhume which worries me exceedingly, and is very hurtfull in my present situation. However I am doing what I dare to to carry it of. -- Believe me at all times most affectionately yours. I must add a little more. A most Horrid plot has been  of a Band of villans counterfeiting the Hampshire currency to a Great amount, no person scarcly but what has more or less of these Bills. I am unlucky enough to have about 5 pounds LM of it, but this is not the worst of it. One Col. Farington who has been concernd in the plot, was taken sick, and has confessd not only the Counterfeiting, but says they had engaged and inlisted near a thousand Men who upon the Troops comeing to  Boston were to fall upon the people and make a General Havock. How much more mercifull God than man, in thus providentially bringing to light these Horrid plots and Schemes. I doubt not Heaven will still continue to favour us, unless our iniquities prevent. The Hampshire people have been stupid enough to let one of the principal plotters Col. Holland out upon Baill and he has made his excape.  ENCLOSURE The above is a true State of our Loss, in the affair at  Danbury. 20 Men killed. 5 Missing. 17 Houses burnt. A Party that went out to bury the Dead have returned, and Report, that they have  62 Regulars. "
Sunday. May 18 1777,"I think myself very happy that not a week passes but what I receive a Letter or two, some times more from you; and  they are longer in comeing than formerly oweing I suppose to the posts being obliged to travel farther round, yet I believe they all faithfully reach me, even the curious conversation between Mr. Burn and your Honour arrived safe and made me laugh very Heartily. Your Last which I believe came by a private Hand and was  dated the 30 of April  came to hand in about 12 days which is sooner than any other has  me since you came to  Philadelphia. Two others accompanied it  one of April 26  and  27 . In one of them you mention your having been unwell, I hope nothing more than a cold. I feel more anxious than ever for your Health, and must intreat of you if you find it fail in any great measure that you would return during the summer Months; should I hear you were sick the imposibility of my comeing to you would render me misirable indeed. I think before this time Many of our Troops must have arrived at Head Quarters, for  we have been dilatory in this and the Neighbouring Towns, others I hear have done their duty better. Not an Hour in the day but what we see soldiers marching. The sure way to prevent their distressing us Here would be to have a strong Army with the General. Their are a number not more than half I believe tho, of this Towns proportion inlisted. The rest were to be drawn at our May meeting, but nothing was done in that way, they concluded to try a little longer to inlist them. The Town send but one Rep. this year and that is Mr. N--s  [Niles] of the middle parish. Give him His pipe and Let him laugh, He will not trouble any body. Philalutheris I suppose will be chosen into the Counsel since He finds that His plan for making them Lackies and Tools to the House was not so acceptable as he expected. I should feel more unhappy and anxious than ever if I  our being again invaded by the wickedest and cruelest of Enemies. I should not dare to tarry here in my present situation, nor yet know where to flee for safety; the recital of the inhumane and Brutal Treatment of those poor creatures who have fallen into their Hands, Freazes me with Horrour. My apprehensions are greatly increasd; should they come this way again I know  [not] what course I should take. Tis an observation of  that they who have lost all tenderness and Fellow -- feeling for others, have withall contracted a certain Callousness of Heart, which renders them insensible to all other satisfactions, but those of the grossest kind. Our Enemies have proved the Truth of the observation in every instance of their conduct. Is it not astonishing what Men may at last bring themselves to, by suppressing passions and affections of the best kind, and   suffering the worst to rule over them in their full strength. Infidelity has been a growing part of the British character for many years. It is not so much to be  at that those who pay no regard to a Supreeme Being should throw of all regard to their fellow creatures and to those precepts and doctrines which require peace and good will to Men; and in a perticuliar manner distinguish the followers of him who hath said by this shall all Men know that ye are my deciples if ye have love one towards an other. Let them reproach us ever so much for our kindness and tenderness to those who have fallen into our Hands, I hope it will never provoke us to retaliate their cruelties; let us put it as much as  out of their power to injure us, but let  us keep in mind the precepts of him who hath commanded us to Love our Enemies; and to excercise towards them acts of Humanity, Benevolence and Kindness, even when they despitefully use us. And here suffer me to quote an Authority which you greatly Esteem, . It is commonly said that revenge is sweet, but to a calm and considerate mind, patience and forgiveness are sweeter, and do afford a much more rational, and solid and durable pleasure than revenge. The monuments of our Mercy and goodness are a far more pleasing and delightfull Spectacle than of our rage and cruelty, and no sort of thought does usually haunt men with more Terror, than the reflexion upon what they have done in the way of Revenge. If our cause is just, it will be best supported by justice and righteousness.  we have many other crimes to answer for, that of cruelty to our Enemies is not chargable upon Americans, and I hope never will be -- if we have err'd it is upon the side of Mercy and have excercised so much lenity to our Enemies as to endanger our Friends -- but their Malice and wicked designs against us, has and will oblige every State to proceed against them with more Rigor. Justice and self preservation are duties as much incumbant upon christians, as forgiveness and Love of Enemies. Adieu. I have devoted an Hour this Day to you. I dare say you are not in debt.  Ever remember with the tenderest affection one whose greatest felicity consists in the firm belief of an unabated Love either by years or absence.  "
May 28 1777,"This is Election Day, but the news of the day I am not able to inform you of as I have Heard nothing from Town. The House is not so  a Body this year as the last. Very few Towns have sent more than one, and those are many of them new Members. Whether they have changd for the better time will discover. I recollect a remark of a writer upon , who says that a single assembly is subject to all the starts of passion and to the caprices of an individual. We have lately experienced the Truth of the observation. A French vessel came into  Boston laiden with a large Quantity of dry goods. The War office had the offer of  they chose to take, after which some things were offerd for sale by the captain at a higher rate than the Regulated price, whilst some were offerd for less. Upon this a certain  B--n  [Boston] Member who comes under the Denomination of a furious Whigg Blusterd about and insisted upon it if he would not comply he ought to be orderd out of the Harbour, and procured a very  [illegible]   unanimous vote for it in the House, but upon its being sent up to the Counsel there was but one vote in favour of it. I have been interrupted by company from writing farther. I have been happy in receiving a number of Letters from you of various dates, since I wrote last. I have not time to notice them now, I will write by the next post, and be more . We Have no News here of any kind. There has been no stir at  Newport yet. Every method is taking to fill up the continental Army which I hope will be effected soon. Many of the soldiers who have  for this Town, are in the Hospital under innoculation. We have two Hospitals in the upper parish, one just opend. Dr. W--s  [Wales] has had great Success. Since March 200 have had the distemper under his care, and not one died. He has now more than  a hundred in it from this and the neighbouring Towns. 6 or 7 of my neighbours went in yesterday, and one from my own family, Jonathan. The Spring in general has been very cold, a few  Hot days, the rest of the time you might sit by the fire which I now do. Our Fleet  Last week and had several days of fine wind and weather. I hear your president is upon the road Home with his family -- I hope He brings me Letters.  Adieu most sincerely yours.  "
"June 1, 1777","My dearest Friend I  to have wrote you by the last Post, but have been so unwell for the week past that I have not been able. We have had very Hot weather which you know never agrees well with me, and greatly distresses me under my present circumstances. I loose my rest a nights, which makes me more unable to bear the Heat of the day. I look forward to the middle of july with more anxiety than I can describe, and the Thoughts of 3 hundreds miles distance are as Greivious as the perils I have to pass through. I am cut of from the privilidge which some of the Brute creation enjoy, that of having their mate sit by them with anxious care during all their Solitary confinement. You live at an  however frugal it may be deemed there, which will astonish your constituents I suppose and be the occasion of many more gratefull acknowledgments, and speaches. If either of us were in the least avaricious or even parsimonious we should poorly Brook the sacrifice we make of property. One Gentleman of the Bar acknowledged that he had made a thousand pounds sterling since the opening of Buisness by admiralty causes and others, and there are some others who have made more than he; and with how much less fatigue than you have sufferd, you are the best judge. I hope this year will if we are any way successfull put an end to your fatigues and your journeys. If you could be at Home and only earnd a Bare subsistance I should be happeier.  Here is extravangantly high, but more tolerable than with you.but A Dollor now is not eaquel to what one Quarter was two years ago, and their is no sort of property which is not held in higher estimation than money. I have long seen the true causes of this Evil, and have been out of favour, with the regulating act, as I have seen I think that it rather served to raise than lower prices. I  to live with as great frugality as posible. I am obliged to pay higher wages  this year than last; Prince was offerd 8 dollors a month and left me. I found upon trial that I must give 12, and put to great difficulty to hire a Hand even at that price, so I sent for Him again, and he got himself releasd, and is with me for 6 months upon those terms. I have paid him his 5 pounds for the winter, have paid the Rates which amount to 24 pounds 2 & 3 pence, have also paid your Brother 5 hundred & 50  which with what you paid when at Home and the small sums that were paid before, amount to the whole of the principal and part of the interest. I would have taken up the bond, but he chose it should lay as there were Notes of Hand which you have against him and an account to settle which he has against you -- and this week I propose to send in to the continental Loan office a hundred pound LM. If I do not explain the matter I fear you will suspect me of being concerned with the Hampshire money makers. You must know then that your sister A--s  [Adams] took up a Note to the amount of a hundred & 27 pounds out of which was oweing to her as you may remember upon the Settlement 45 pounds but and about the same time my unkle T--r  [Thaxter] took up a Note principal and interest amounted to 56 pounds which enabled me to pay your Brother, and a few days ago one Stetson took up a Bond of 20 pounds and Clark one of 30 which with a treasurers Note which is due of 20 pounds more and 24 pounds which I received for the Sale of a Lighter! will come near to compleat the Hundred pounds which I propose to send to the office. Every fellow has his pockets full of money and chuses no doubt to pay his debts if he is a good Husband.  I have done the best in my power with what I received and hope for your approbation which is always a full compensation to yours -- ever yours.  "
"June 8,1777","I generally  to write you once a week, if my Letters do not reach you, tis oweing to the neglect of the post. I generally get Letters from you once a week, but seldom in a fortnight after they are wrote. I am sorry to find that your Health fails. I should greatly rejoice to see you, I know of no earthly blessing which would make me happier, but I cannot wish it upon the terms of ill Health. No seperation was ever more painfull to me than the last, may the joy of meeting again be eaquel to the pain of seperation; I regret that I am in a Situation to wish away one of the most precious Blessings of life, yet as the months pass off, I count them up with pleasure and reckon upon tomorrow as the 5th which has passd since your absence. I have some times melancholly reflections, and immagine these seperations as preparatory to a still more painfull one in which even hope the anchor of the Soul is lost, but whilst that remains no Temperary absence can ever abate or wean or abate the ardor of my affection. Bound together by many tender ties, there scarcly wanted an addition, yet I feel that there soon will be an additionall one. Many many are the tender sentiments I have felt for the parent on this occasion. I doubt not they are reciprocal, but I often feel the want of his presence and the soothing tenderness of his affection. Is this weakness or is it not? I am happy in a daughter who is both a companion and an assistant in my Family affairs and who I think has a prudence and steadiness beyond her years. You express a longing after the enjoyments of your little Farm. I do not wonder at it, that also wants the care and attention of its master -- all that the mistress can do is to see that it does not go to ruin. She would take pleasure in improvements, and study them with assiduity if she was  with a sufficency to accomplish them. The season promisses plenty at present and the english grass never lookd better. You inquire after the Asparagrass. It performs very well this year and produces us a great plenty. I long to send you a  of cider, but find  it impracticable, as no vessels can pass from this State to yours. I rejoice at the good way our affairs seem to be in and Hope your Herculian Labours will be crownd with more success this year than the last. Every thing wears a better aspect, we have already taken two Transports of theirs with Hessians on board, and this week a prize was carried into  Salem taken by the Tyranicide with 4000 Blankets and other valuable articles on board. I do not feel very apprehensive of an attack upon  Boston. I hope we shall be quiet. I should make a  hand of running now.  Boston is not what it once was. It has no Head, no Men of distinguishd abilities, they behave like children.  the infamous Hampshire counterfeiter was taken last week in  Boston and is committed to jail in Irons. I hope they will now keep a strong guard upon him. We are not like to get our now unpopular act  I fear. I own I was in favour of it, but I have seen it fail and the ill consequences arising from it have made me wish it had never been made. Yet the House are nearly divided about it. Genell. W--n  [Warren] will write you I suppose. He and his Lady have spent part of the week with me. I wish you would be so good as to mention the dates of the Letters you receive from me. The last date of yours was May 22. 5 dated in May since this day week. I wonder how you get time to write so much. I feel very  to you for every line. You will I know remember me often when I cannot write to you.  Good Night  so dark that I cannot see to add more than that I am with the utmost tenderness Yours ever Yours.  "
" [Braintree,  15 June 1777]","This is the 15 of June. Tomorrow our new Edition of the Regulating act takes place, and will I fear add wrath to Bitterness. No arguments which were urgd could prevail upon the court to repeal it. A committee in this Town is chosen to see it , and I suppose in other Towns. I am surprizd that when the ill Effects of it are so visible, and the spirit of opposition to it so general and voilent that there should be a determination to enforce it. There is a very evil spirit  and an encreasing Bitterness between the Town and Country. The Town of  Boston has lost its leaders, and the respectable figure it once made is exchanged for party squables, for Avarice, venality, Animosity, contention, pride, weakness and dissapation. I wish I could say this spirit was confined to the Capital, but indeed too much of it prevails in the cottage. Really  we are a most ungratefull people,favourd as we have been with peculiar Blessings and favours to make so poor returns. With the best opportunities for becomeing a happy people, and all the materials in our power, yet we have neither skill nor wisdom to put them together. The House and Counsel have come to a determination to form a , and to send it out to the people for their inspection. I expect there will be great difficulty as ninety two Towns I am told have sent no representitives, and the  Countys of Worcester and Berkshire make up more than a third of the House. Some have instructed their rep's to form a Goverment, others have directly forbid them. There has been a list of Tories belonging to this Town made out, and  in to the Town 13 in number. I will enclose the list. Some of them I believe had as goods have been omitted. It will put them to some expence but the practice is to employ one or two gentlemen of the Bar, who generally make out to get them acquitted. Then I expect they will be returnd to us, more Rancorous than before. There is a movement of , whether he designs for  Boston or  Road Island or where is as yet unknown -- I hope for neither. I think I could not tarry here with safety should he make an attack upon either, and the thought  of being driven from my own Habitation at this time is more distressing than ever. If I had only myself to look after it would be less anxiety to me; if you hear of our being invaded this way, I think you must return. I used to have courage, but you cannot wonder at my apprehensions when you consider my circumstances. I can but poorly walk about House; However I am not of an over anxious make; I will trust in providence that I shall be provided for. I think we shall know in a week whether he designs this way, and you I suppose will know as soon as we. I wish you would advise me what I had best do if we should be attacked this way. -- We have not now a Man either upon the Castle or at Nantasket. I believe our Enimies know it. Two continental vessels have arrived with Salt from Bilbo in the last week, and four prizes sent in by the Fleet. As they came in a Saturday have not  with what they are loaded. Have received two letters since I wrote last,  one of May 24  and  one of May 27 . As to your injuntions with regard to my taking any money but this States and continental, I have strictly adhered to them. I know of whom I received the Hampshire money, and  it again. I took it of Sister  [Adams] as part of the pay for the Lighter, and she of Vose of  Milton. She returnd it the same week to Him, which she took it but He refused to receive it, and tho she has twice sent it to Him, and he does not pretend to say He did not pay it to her, Yet he will not take it again. What can be done? I had several other Bills, but knowing of whom I received them, I found no difficulty in returning them again. -- There will no money pass in this State after next month but continental and this States. How is your cold? Are you better than you was? I feel anxious for your Health.  Let me know every time you write How you do. A certain Gentleman was ask'd when he expected to go to  Philadelphia. O he did not know. That depended upon some of the others returning. He supposed they would be running Home again in a month or two, as they always were. For his part he had tarried so many months. -- A great merrit to tarry from Home when a man loves any place better than home. I am for having them all stay now, to keep him at home as a punishment. Tis of no great importance where he is.  "
June 23 1777,"I have just  to my Chamber, but an impulce seazes me to write you a few lines before I close my Eye's. Here I often come and sit myself down alone to think of my absent Friend, to ruminate over past scenes, to read over Letters, journals &c. Tis a melancholy kind of pleasure I find in this amusement, whilst the weighty cares of state  leave room for a tender recollection or sentiment to steal into the Bosome of my Friend. In my last I  some fears least the Enemy should soon invade us here. My apprehensions are in a great measure abated by late accounts received from the General. We have a very fine Season here, rather cold for a fortnight, but nothing like a drought. You would smile to see what a Farmer our Brother C--h  makes, his whole attention is as much engaged in it, as it ever was in Spermacity Works, Watch Work, or Prophesies. You must know he has purchased, (in spight of the C--ls  [Colonels] Threats) that Farm he talkd of. He gave  a large price for it tis True, but tis a neat, profitable place, 300 sterling, but money is lookd upon of very little value, and you can scarcly purchase any article now but by Barter. You shall have wool for flax or flax for wool, you shall have veal,Beaf or pork for salt, for sugar, for Rum, &c. but mony we will not take, is the daily language. I will work for you for Corn, for flax or wool, but if I work for money you must give a cart load of it be sure. What can be done, and which way shall we help ourselves? Every article and necessary of life is rising daily. Gold dear Gold would soon lessen the Evils. I was  an article the other day for two dollors in silver for which they askd me six in paper. I have no more to purchase with than if every  was a silver one. Every paper dollor cost a silver one, why then cannot it be eaquelly valuable? You will refer me to Lord Kames I know,  [illegible]   who  solves the matter. I hope in favour you will not Emit any more paper, till what we have at least becomes more valuable. Nothing remarkable has  since I wrote you last. You do not in your last Letters mention how you do -- I will hope better. I want a companion a Nights, many of them are wakefull and Lonesome, and  ""tierd Natures sweet restorer, Balmy Sleep,"" flies me. How hard it is to reconcile myself to six months longer absence! Do you feel it urksome? Do you sigh for Home? And would you willingly share with me what I have to pass through? Perhaps before this reaches you and meets with a Return, I wish the day passt, yet dread its arrival. --  Adieu most sincerely most affectionately Yours.  "
July 2 1777,"I sit down to write you a few lines this morning as I am  the post should go, without telling you that I am well, as usual. Suppose you will be more anxious for me this month than common. I shall write as often and as long as I am able, tho I do not expect that it will be more than two or 3 weeks more at furthest. You will not fail writing me by every opportunity, receiving Letters once a week from you serves to keep up my Spirits and cheer my Heart, which of late does not feel the gayest. I rejoice to find by your last that your Health is better. I should have known it from the stile of your Letter if you had not told me so. The dates run  june the 2d ,  4th  and  8th . Since I wrote last we have had frequent reports of How's sitting out for  Philadelphia. I have not been very uneasy about it. I confess I had rather He should make a visit to you than to me, at this time, more especially since you seem so desirous of it. Our last accounts are of a Skirmish in  Brunswick and the burning of that Town and of the Troops retreat to Amboy. I think they make no valient appearence this season.-- We have an other account from  Halifax, that the Govener there has orderd every House to be cleard and Barrack for that he expects them there immediately. Yesterday our Tories so  appeard in  Boston to be tried before the worshipfull justices Q--y  [Quincy] and Hill; they had engaged counsel Mr. T -- r, who soon let the Court know that Mr. Q -- y was not qualified to try them as he had never taken the oath since the declaration of independance, and that the recognisances were not signed -- so they all marchd back again. They are pretty much netled and fear being sent on board the guard ship. Seven are  at  Bridgwater. As to  I can not tell you more than G-n. [General] W--n  [Warren] has wrote you. I hope in time we shall be able to sit down quietly -- am sorry to see so much bickering about it in Pensilvana. You inquire how our season is here. We have had a very fine one rather the coldest. There is a prospect of good crops of Grass and Grain. The fruit will suffer much by the frosts. Not much cider I fear. Pray write to  by the first opportunity. Our young ones are all well. We have enjoyd great Health since the small pox, for which we cannot be sufficently thankfull. Tis very Healthy every where. We have had a vast deal of thunder and lightning this Summer. "
July 9 1777,"I sit down to write you this post, and from my present feelings  the last I shall be able to write for some time if I should do well. I have been very unwell for this week past, with some complaints that have been new to me, tho I hope not dangerous. I was last night taken with a shaking fit, and am very apprehensive that a life was lost. As I have no reason  to think otherways; what may be the consequences to me, Heaven only knows. I know not of any injury to myself, nor any thing which could occasion what I fear. I would not Have you too much . I keep up some Spirits yet,tho I would have you prepaird for any Event that may happen.  I can add no more than that I am in every Situation unfeignedly Yours, Yours.  "
July 10  [1777] 9 o clock Evening,"About an Hour ago  I received a Letter from my Friend dated June 21 : in this manner ""my dearest Friend."" It gave me a most agreable Sensation, it was a cordial to my Heart. That one single expression dwelt upon my mind and playd about my Heart, and was more valuable to me than any part of the Letter, except the close of it. Whether It was because my Heart was softned and my mind enervated by my sufferings, and I wanted the personal and tender soothings of my dearest Friend, that  [renderd] it so valuable to me at this time. I have  [no] doubt of the tenderest affection or sincerest regard of my absent Friend, yet an expression of that kind will sooth my Heart to rest amidst a thousand anxietyes. Tis now 48 Hours since I can say I really enjoyed any Ease, nor am I ill enough to summons any attendance unless my sisters. Slow, lingering and troublesome is the present situation. The Dr. encourages me to Hope that my apprehensions are groundless respecting what I wrote you yesterday, I cannot say I have had any reason to allter my mind. My spirits However are better than they were yesterday, and I almost wish I had not let that Letter go. If there should be agreable News  to tell you, you shall know it as soon as the post can convey it. I pray Heaven that it may be soon or it seems to me I shall be worn out. I must lay my pen down this moment, to bear what I cannot fly from -- and now I have endured it I reassume my pen and will lay by all my own feelings and thank you for your obligeing Letters. -- A prize arrived this week at  Marble Head with 400 Hogsheads of rum a board sent in by Manly. -- Every article and necessary of life rises here daily. Sugar has got to  [8 pounds?] per hundred, Lamb to 1 shilling per pound and all ot  [other] things in proportion.We have the finest Season here that I have known for many years. The fruit was injured by the cold East winds and falls of, the Corn looks well, Hay will be plenty, but your Farm wants manure. I shall endeavour to have Sea weed carted every Leasure moment that can be had. That will not be many. Help is so scarce and so expensive I can not Hire a days mowing under 6 shillings. How has done himself no  by his late retreat. We fear most now for Tycon. [Tyconderoga].  Tis reported to day that tis taken. We have a vast many men who look like officers continually riding about. I wonder what they can be after, why they do not repair to the army. We wonder too what Congress are a doing? We have not heard of late. How do you do? Are you glad you are out of the way of sour faces. I could look  upon you in the midst of sufferings -- allmighty God carry me safely through them. There I would hope I have a Friend ever nigh and ready to assist me, unto whom I commit myself. This is Thursday Evening. It cannot go till , and then I hope will be accompanied with more agreable inteligance. I got more rest last night than I expected, this morning am rather more ill than I was yesterday. This day ten years ago master  came into this world. May I have reason again to recollect it with peculiar gratitude.  Adieu.  "
July 16 1777,"Join with me my dearest Friend in Gratitude to Heaven, that a life I know you value, has been  and carried thro Distress and danger altho the dear Infant is numberd with its ancestors. My apprehensions with regard to it were well founded.  my Friends would have fain perswaded me that the Spleen  [or] the Vapours had taken hold of me I was as perfectly sensible of its discease as I ever before was of its existance. I was also aware of the danger which awaited me; and which tho my sufferings were great thanks be to Heaven I have been supported through, and would silently submit to its dispensations in the loss of a sweet daughter; it appeard to be a very fine Babe, and as it never opened its Eyes in this world it lookd as tho they were only closed for sleep. The circumstance which put an end to its existance, were was evident upon its birth, but at this distance and in a Letter which may possibly fall into the Hands of some unfealing Ruffian I must omit particuliars. Suffice it to say that it was not oweing to any injury which I had sustaind, nor could any care of mine have prevented it. My Heart was much set upon a Daughter. I had had a strong  that my desire would be granted me. It was -- but to shew me the uncertanty  of all sublinary enjoyments cut of e'er I could call it mine. No one was so much affected with the loss of it as its Sister who  in tears for Hours. I have so much cause for thankfullness amidst my sorrow, that I would not entertain a repineing thought. So short sighted and so little a way can we look into futurity that we ought patiently to submit to the dispensation of Heaven. I am so comfortable that I am  at myself, after what I have sufferd I did not expect to rise from my Bed for many days. This is but the 5th day and I have set up some Hours. I However feel myself weakend by this exertion, yet I could not refrain  the temptation of writing with my own Hand to you.  Adieu dearest of Friends adieu -- Yours most affectionately.  "
July 23 1777,"My dearest Friend Notwithstanding my confinement I think I have not omitted writing you by every post. I have  Health and strength beyond expectation; and never was so well in so short a time before. Could I see my Friend in reality as I often do in immagination I think I should feel a happiness beyond expression; I had pleasd myself with the Idea of presenting him a fine son or daughter upon his return, and had figurd to myself the smiles of joy and pleasure with which he would receive it, but  [those] dreams are buried in the Grave, transitory as the morning Cloud, short lived as the Dew Drops. Heaven  continue to us those we already have and make them blessings. I think I feel more solicitious for their welfare than ever, and more anxious if posible for the life and Health of their parent. I fear the extreem Heat of the season, and the different temperament of the climate and the continual application to Buisness will finish a constitution naturally feeble. I know not in what manner you will be affected at the loss, Evacuation, sale, giving up -- which of the terms befits the late conduct at  . You may know more of the  reasons for this conduct (as I hear the commanding officer went immediately to Congress) than we can devine this way; but this I can truly say no Event since the commencement of the War has appeard so allarming to me, or given me eaquel uneasiness. Had the Enemy fought and conquerd the fort, I could have borne it, but to leave it with all the stores before it was even attackd, has exited a thousand Suspicions, and gives room for more wrath than despondency. We every day look for an attack upon  this way. The reports of this week are that a number of Transports with Troops have  [arrived] at Newport. Some expresses went through this Town yesterday. Yours of June 30   me last week. I am not a little surprizd that you have not received Letters from me later than the 9 of June. I have never faild for this two months writing you once a week. Tho they contain matters of no great importance I should be glad to know when you receive them. We have had a remarkable fine Season here, no drought this summer. The Corn looks well, and english Grain . We cannot  be sufficently thankfull to a Bountifull providence that the Horrours of famine are not added to those of war, and that so much more Health prevails in our Camps than in the year past. Many of your Friends desire to be  to you. Some complain that you do not write them. Adieu. Master Tom stands by and sends duty -- he often recollects How par used to put him to jail as he calls it. They are all very Healthy this summer, and are in expectation of a Letter every packet that arrives.  Yours, ever yours, PS Price Current!! This day I gave 4  a peice for Sythes and a Guiney a Gallon for  New england Rum. We come on here finely. What do you think will become of us. If you will come Home and turn Farmer, I will be dairy woman. You will make more than is allowd you, and we shall grow wealthy. Our Boys shall go into the Feild and work with you, and my Girl shall stay in the House and assist me.  "
July 30 1777,"I dare say before this Time you have interpreted the Northern Storm; if the presages chill'd your Blood,  how must you be froze and stiffend at the Disgrace brought upon our Arms unless some warmer passion seaze you, and Anger and resentment Fire your Breast. How are all our vast Magazines of Cannon, powder, Arms, , provision, Medicine &c. to be restored to us -- but what is vastly more, How shall the Disgrace be wiped away? How shall our lost Honour be retreaved? The reports with regard to that fortress are very vague and uncertain. Some write from thence, that there was not force sufficent to defend it, others say it might have stood a long Siege. Some there are who ought to know why and wherefore we have given away a place of such importance. That the inquiry will be made I make no doubt, and if Cowardice, Guilt, Deceit, are found upon any one How high or exalted soever his station, may shame, reproach, infamy, hatred, and the execrations of the  be his portion. I would not be so narrow minded as to suppose that there are not many Men of all Nations  of Honour, Virtue and Integrety; yet tis to be lamented that we have not Men among ourselves sufficently qualified for War to take upon them the most important command. It was customary among the Carthaginians to have a Military School, in which the  of their Nobility and those whose talants and ambition prompted them to aspire to the first dignities, learnt the art of War. From among these they selected all their general officers, for tho they employd mercenary Soldiers, they were too jealous and suspicious to employ foreign Generals. Will a Foreigner whose Interest  is not naturally connected with ours, (any otherways than as the cause of Liberty is the cause of all mankind), will he act with the same Zeal or expose himself to eaquel dangers with the same resolution for a Republick of which he is not a member as He would have done for his own Native Country? And can  the people repose an eaquel confidence in them, even supposing them Men of integrety and abilities, and that they meet with success eaquel to their abilities. How much envy and Malice, is employd against them; and How galling to pride, How mortifying to Humane Nature to see itself excelld. I have nothing new to entertain you with, unless it is  an account of a New Set of Mobility which have lately taken the Lead in  [Boston]. You must know that there is a great Scarcity of Sugar and Coffe, articles which the Female part of the State are very loth to give up, expecially whilst they consider the Scarcity occasiond by the merchants having secreted a large Quantity. There has been much rout and Noise in the Town for several weeks. Some Stores had been opend by a number of people and the Coffe and Sugar carried into the Market and dealt out by pounds. It was rumourd that an eminent, wealthy, stingy Merchant (who is a Batchelor) had a Hogshead of Coffe in his Store which he refused to sell to the committee under 6 shillings per pound. A Number of Females some say a hundred, some say more assembled with a cart and trucks, marchd down to the Ware House and demanded the keys, which he refused to deliver, upon which one of them seazd him by his Neck and tossd him into the cart. Upon his finding no Quarter he deliverd the keys, when they tipd up the cart and dischargd him, then opend the Warehouse, Hoisted out the Coffe themselves, put it into the trucks and drove off. It was reported that he had a Spanking among them, but this I believe was not true. A large concourse of Men stood  silent Spectators of the whole transaction. Your kind  received dated july 11  favourd by the Hon. Mr. Hews, left at my unkles in  Boston. Tis not like he will make an Excursion this way, if he should shall treat him in the best manner I am able. -- What day does your post arrive, and how long are Letters travelling from me to you? I receive one from you every week, and I as regularly write one but you make no mention of receiving any, or very seldom. In your Hurry do you forget it, or do they not reach you.  I am very well for the time, not yet 3 weeks since my confinement and yet I think I have wrote you a very long Letter.  Adieu, your good Mother is just come, desires to be  to you. So does my Father and Sister who have just left me, and so does she whose greatest happiness consists in being tenderly beloved by her absent Friend and subscribes herself ever his  "
"August 5, [1777]","If  half a dozen places at the same time is an act of Generalship How may boast of his late conduct. We have never since the Evacuation of  Boston been under apprehensions of an invasion from them eaquel to what we sufferd last week. All  Boston was in confusion, packing up and carting out of Town, Household furniture, military stores, goods &c. Not less than a thousand Teams were imployd a fryday and Saturday -- and to their shame be it told, not a small trunk would they carry under 8 dollors and many of them I am told askd a hundred dollors a load, for carting a Hogshead of Molasses 8 miles 30 dollors. -- O!  [illegible]   Humane Nature, or rather O! inhumane nature what art thou? The report of the Fleets being seen off of  Cape Ann a fryday Night, gave me the allarm, and tho pretty weak, I set about packing up my things and a saturday removed a load. When I looked around me and beheld the bounties of Heaven so liberally bestowed in fine Feilds of corn, grass, flax and english grain, and thought it might soon become a prey to these merciless  ravagers, our habitations laid waste, and if our flight preserved our lives, we must return to barren Feilds, empty barns and desolated habitations if any we found, perhaps no 1 where to lay our Heads, my Heart was too full to bear the weight of affliction which I thought just ready to overtake us, and my body too weak almost to bear the shock unsupported by my better Half. But thanks be to Heaven we are at present  from our Fears, respecting ourselves. I now feel anxious for your safety but hope prudence will direct to a proper care and attention to yourselves. May this second attempt of  prove his utter ruin. May destruction overtake him as a whirlwind. We have a report of an engagement at the Northward in which our troops behaved well, drove the Enemy into their lines,  and took 300 & 50 prisoners. The account came in last Night. I have not perticuliars. -- We are under apprehensions that the Hancock is taken. Your   Letters of the 8th ,  l0th  and  13th  came to hand last week.  I hope before this time you are releaved from the anxiety you express for your Bosom Friend. I feel my sufferings amply rewarded in the tenderness you express for me, but in one of your Letters you have drawn a picture which drew a flood of tears from my Eyes, and rung my Heart with anguish inexpressible. I pray Heaven I may not live to realize it. Tis almost 14 years since we were united, but not more than half that time have we had the happiness of living together. The  world may consider it in what light they please, I consider it as a sacrifice to my Country and one of my greatest misfortunes  [for my husband] to be seperated from my children at a time of life when the joint instructions and admonition of parents sink deeper than in maturer years. The Hopes of the smiles and approbation of my Friend sweetens all my toil and  "
August 12. [1777],"A few lines by way of remembrance every week  I have nothing new to write you if I may judge you by myself are very acceptable. I long for a wedensday which to me is the happiest day of the week. I never fail of a pacquet, tis soon read, and then the next wedensday is thought of with the same Solisitude The last post brought me  yours of july 16 ,  18  and  20th . You have often of late  a daughter with much tenderness and affection, but before this time you must know of our Bereavement. I felt it last Sunday with all its poignancy. It was the first time of my going out. Your Brother held up a daughter and call'd it by the Name of Susana. I wishd to have call'd ours had it lived after my own dear Mother, and was much gratified by your mentioning it and requesting it. But tis now of no importance either the Name or the Relation. Do you feel in your own Breast any Sentiments of tenderness for one you never knew, for one who could scarcly be said ever to have had an existance? The loss occasions very different Sensations from those I once before experienced, but still I found I had a tenderness and an affection greater than I immagined could have possess'd my Heart for one who was not endeard to me by its smiles and its graces. But the Parent is dear to me, dear to me beyond the power of words to discribe. I always feel a perticuliar regard for the young fellow who has attended upon him in the capacity of a servant. Nay even the sight of a Garment worn belonging to him will raise a mixture both of pleasure and pain in my Bosome. Can it then be strange that I should feel a  fondness and a tender affection for a pledg of unabated Love, a Love pure as the Gold without alloy I have seen an advertisement in your papers of some Select Essays upon Husbandry containing the manner of whitening and Bleaching cloth, raising flax and hemp &c. If you think the Book worth  should be obliged to you for it. We must study to make the most of our Husbandery or we must starve. 3 dollors will not purchase what one would (of any article that can be mentiond) two months ago. I believe we are no way behind hand in prices  with any of the other States. You wish yourself at Home to study agriculture with your Brother Farmer. Tis a wish I most heartily join in, but he is a great  I assure you. He has cut the chief of his Hay this summer and made the whole of it with his own hands, and he has several tons too. He has New Built his barn which he has done much of himself. His whole Heart is engaged in Farming. You never took more pleasure in your meddows and Feilds in their greatest perfection. Hardwick begs me to apply to you to purchase him some needles as he is now obliged to stand still for want of them, will send the money for them if you think it may be  with safety. If you would send along only one hundred in a Letter to me he would be greatly obliged, he has wrote to Turner the Numbers. We wish to know where the Enemy are and what they are about, but it seems to me your  is very uncertain and in general bad. General Skliler Skiler Schuyler has calld upon us for 2000 militia. We seem to be  [already] striped of so many  Hands as scarcly to leave enough to perform our Farming. They make strange work in this Town in procuring their Men as usual, it always was a croocked place. I hear nothing new -- nothing worth writing you. Enclosed is a Letter your Brother desires you would take care of.  Adieu most sincerely yours,   "
"Boston  August 22 1777
","My dearest Friend I came yesterday to this Town for a ride after my confinement, and to see my Friends. I have not been into it since I had the happiness of spending a week here with you. I am feeble and faint with the Heat of the weather, but otherways very well. I feel very anxious for your Health and almost fear to hear from you least I should hear you were sick; but hope your temperance and caution will preserve your Health. I hope, if you can get any way through these Hot months you will recruit. Tis very Healthy throughout Town and Country for the Season, the chin cough prevails in Town among children but has not yet  the Country. Your Letters of August 1 ,  3  and  4th  came by last nights post, and I have to acknowledge the  of  yours of july 27 ,  28  and 30th  by last wedensdays post. I acknowledge my self greatly indebted to you for so frequently writing amidst all your other cares and attentions. I would fain believe that tis a releafe to you after the cares of the day, to converse with your Friend. I most sincerely wish your situation was such that the amusements your family could afford you, might have been intermixed with the weighty cares that oppress you. As to  I wish we could know what he means that we might be able to gaurd against him. I hope however that he will not come this way, and I believe the Season is so far advanced, that he will not venture. At the Northward our affairs look more favorable. We have been, in several of our late engagements. Heaven preserve our dear Countrymen who behave worthy of us and reward them both here and hereafter. Our Militia are chiefly raisd, and will I hope be marchd of immediately. There has been a most shamefull neglect some where. This continent has paid thousands to officers and Men who have been loitering about playing foot -- Ball and nine pins, and doing their own private buisness whilst they ought to have been defending our forts and we are now suffering for the neglect. The late call of Men from us will distress us in our Husbandry. I am a great sufferer as the High Bounty one hundred , has tempted of my Negro Head, and left me just in the midst of our Hay. The english and fresh indeed we have finishd, but the salt is just comeing on, and How to turn my self, or what to do I know not. His going away would not worry me so much if it was not for the rapid depretiation of our money. We can scarcly get a days work done for money   and if money is paid tis at such a rate that tis almost imposible to live. I live as I never did before, but I am not agoing to complain. Heaven has blessd us with fine crops. I hope to have 200 hundred Bushels of corn and a hundred & 50 weight of flax. English Hay we have more than we had last year, notwithstanding your ground wants manure. We are like to have a plenty of sause. I shall fat Beaf and pork enough, make butter and cheesse enough. If I have neither Sugar, molasses, coffe nor Tea I have no right to complain. I can live without any of them and if what I enjoy I can share with my partner and with Liberty, I can sing o be joyfull and sit down content As to  I have heithertoo procured materials sufficent to cloath my children and servants which I have done wholy in Home Spun. I have contracted no debts that I have not discharg'd, and one of our Labourers Prince I have paid seven months wages to since you left me. Besides that I have paid Bracket near all we owed him which was to the amount of 15 pounds lawfull money, set up a cider press &c., besides procuring and repairing many other articles in the Husbandery way, which you know are constantly wanted. I should do exceeding well if we could but keep the money good, but at the rate we go on I know not what will become of us.  But I must bid you adieu or the post will go of without my Letter. Dearest Friend, adieu. Words cannot convey to you the tenderness of my affection. "
August 27 1777,"Your Man and Horse arrived the 22 day of this Month. The Horse and Man look pretty low in flesh. You advise me to sell the Horse, but I think upon the whole after consulting my Friends it will not be prudent. It will be but a little more than 3 months before I hope to send for you. If I should sell him, I should be put to great difficulty to procure  as good Horses are very scarce. This you have, we know will perform a journey. An other reason is that tho I might to day sell this Horse well, tomorrow or in a months time I must give double the price for an other, according as other things rise. I have therefore determined to have him Bled and turn him away to get into good Heart till I send for you.Bracket who has had the Small Pox since you left us, desires he may come for you. If you approve him let me know. I believe he will do very well. We have had a turn of  Hot weather when we could neither work or sleep. If I sufferd so much here, what I often think must you, in that climate. The Hot weather here you know is of short Duration and generally succeeded by a cold storm or an Easterly Breaze which soon revives our Languid Spirits. The fruit this Season is very poor and very little of it. Our Good unkle says he never tastes a drop of cider but he thinks of you, and wishes you could partake with him. The Season is fine for grain and grass. We have had nothing like a drought this Summer. How much pleasure would you have taken in rambling over your meddows and Feilds. I endure with more patience this long and tedious absence, hoping that you will have served long enough to ensure you a release. I Most sincerely congratulate you upon our late successes at the Northward, which is attended with the most  circumstances which have taken place since the commencment of the War. Attacking the Enemy in their entrenchments and with the Militia too, is plucking a feather from the plume of the continentall Troops. I wish it may inspire all with an Emulation to conquer and subdue these Bloodthirsty wretches. It has given a spring to our Troops, and vigor to all our countanances. Tis really strange that no certain inteligance can be obtaind where How is gone, or what his intention is, nor is it certain that he has his Troops aboard, but let it be what it will this late affair will be a damper. I believe we may rest pretty secure in this Quarter this Season. We have no News but what will reach you before this Letter will, a Ship came in a Sunday where from I have not , but hear she brought cannon and stores for the 74 Gun Ship which is a Building.  sends his duty and longs to see Pappa. The poor fellow met with a bad accident a week ago. He saw some Hens robing the pea vines and went into the garden to order them out. Our people had very carelessly set a Scythe there which he did not see, he run against it, and cut him across one of his legs so bad that the Doctor was obliged to sew it up, which he bore like a Soldier as he has the wound ever since. The confinement was the most grevious part of it, the wound is in a good way and he begins to run again. All the children are well. Mr. Thaxter received the Letters you mention and was sworn in accordingly.  "
Septr. 10 1777,"My dearest Friend The accounts you give of the Heat of the weather, gives me great uneasiness upon account of your Health. I fear it will through  into a fever, or relax you so as to ruin your Health. We have had some extreem Hot weather here when the glasses have been at 92. I have slept many Nights this Summer with all my windows open which I do not remember ever to have done before. Our Hot weather you know never lasts more than 3 days at a time, and since Sepbr. came in I have been glad to sit at a fire morning and Evening; we had a small frost a night or two ago, but I believe it did not hurt any thing. Yesterday  Eight months since you left me. When shall I see you. I often dream of you, but the other Night I was very unhappy. Methought you was returnd but met me so Coldly that my Heart ackd half an hour after I waked. It would ake in earnest if I once realizd such a reception, and yet if I had a Friend whom I cared little or nothing about, I should be saved many an anxious hour. Yet I would not be destitute of that tender Solisitude notwithstanding all the pain it costs me. I have  with Turner and paid him his account which amounted to 10 16s. 8d. including what you paid him. He is not in so good Bread as he was at  Philadelphia, he cannot procure any Materials to work up. Sheeps wool is 8 shillings a pound, Cotton 12, other articles in proportion. What can be done? Our money will soon be as useless as blank paper. Tis True I have not much to be anxious about, but it will soon take all I have to pay my day labourers, mowing 12 shillings a day, and much obliged to them to come at that. Butter is 3 shillings, cheeses 2, Mutton 18 pence,Beaf 18 pence, Lamb 1 & 4 pence. Corn at no price, none to be had. Barly 8 shillings a Bushel, Rye none, sold only by way of Barter. Sugar 15 pounds per hundred, Coffe 10 shillings per pound, Molasses 24 per Gallon, Rum 28 ditto. What is to become of sallery people? With Hard money not one article of the produce of this Country but what I could purchase cheeper than ever it was sold, nor do they value offering 8 dollors for one. Necessity is the Mother of invention. There is a Manufactory of Molasses set up in several Towns. Green corn Storks ground and  down to Molasses,tis said an acer acre will produce a Barrel. I have seen some of it, it both tastes and looks like Sugar Bakers molasses. Tis confidently reported that  has landed his Troops between  Philadelphia and  Baltimore. We are anxious to hear. We have not had any late News from our Army at the Northward. The papers will inform you of several valuable prizes which have been sent in, and with their contents. Tis almost a fortnight since I wrote you before. I have had but one  from you. I mean since a News paper without a Letter. Our good ankle to whom you wrote as he thought, was very eager to get his Letter. He heard of it and rode up in Town on purpose, but behold when he opend it a News paper presented itself. He wanted to know if you had not a House call'd a bettering House proper for persons who were out of their Senses. Adieu. I have nothing worth writing I think, and my Eyes are very weak which unfits me for writing much in the Evening.  Believe me at all times yours ever yours,  "
Sep 17. [1777],"Best of Friends I have to  a feast of Letters from you since I wrote last, their dates from August 19 to Sepbr. 1   [Please see the following letters:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ] . It is a very great satisfaction to me to know from day to day the Movements of How, and his Bantitti. We live in hourly expectation of important inteligance from both armies. Heaven Grant us victory and peace, two Blessings I fear we are very undeserving of. Enclosed you will find a Letter to  who was so obliging as to send me a plan of that part of the Country which is like to be the present seat of war. He accompanied it with a very polite Letter, and I esteem myself much obliged to him, but there is no reward this side the grave that would be a temptation to me to undergo the agitation and distress I was thrown into by receiving a Letter in his Handwriting franked by him. It seems almost imposible that the Humane mind could take in, in so small a space of time, so many Ideas as rushd upon mine in the space of a moment, I cannot describe to you what I felt. The sickness or death of the dearest of Friends with ten thousand  seazd my immagination. I took up the Letter, then laid it down, then gave it out of my Hand unable to open it, then collected resolution enough to unseal it, but dared not read it, begun at the bottom, read a line, then attempted to begin it, but could not. A paper was enclosed, I venturd upon that, and finding it a plan,recoverd enough to read the Letter but I pray Heaven I may never realize such a nother moment of distress. I  to have wrote you a long Letter for really I owe you one, but have been prevented by our worthy  [Plymouth] Friends who are Here upon a visit in their way Home and tis now so late at Night just struck 12 that I will defer any thing further till the next post.  Good Night Friend of my Heart, companion of my youth -- Husband and Lover -- Angles watch thy Repose.  "
Sepbr. 21  [1777],"I  before this reaches you some very important Event must take place betwen the two Armies. Affairs on all Sides seem to be workd up to a crisis, How is putting his whole force in action and seems determined to drive or be driven. I feel in a most  situation between hope and fear, there must be fighting and very Bloody Battles too I apprehend. O! how my Heart recoils at the Idea. Why is Man calld Humane when he delights so much in Blood, Slaughter and devastation; even those who are stiled civilizd Nations think this little Spot worth contending for, even to Blood. We have confused accounts of a Battle at the Northward Last , in which the Enemy were put to flight. God grant it may prove true. Vigorous Exertions now on all sides may prove of the most happy concequence and terminate this cruel War. I long for a decissive Battle -- and for peace, an honourable peace. I hope the enemy are as much in our power as you fancy them. Have just read a hand Bill giving a  account of our the engagement, at the Northward. You will have it long before this reaches you. The loss of  Ticondoroga has awakened the sleeping Genious of America and call'd forth all her Martial fire, may it never again be lulld to rest till crownd with victory and peace. Good officers will make good Soldiers.Xanthippus, the Lacedaemonian General who had been educated in the Discipline of Sparta, and learnt the Art of War in that renowned and Excellent School, when he was call'd to assist the Carthaginians, who had been defeated in several Battles against the Romans, declared publickly, and repeated it often in the hearing of their officers, that the misfortunes of the Carthaginians were oweing intirely to the incapacity of their Generals, and he proved clearly to the Counsel that by a conduct opposite to the former they would not only secure their dominions but drive the Enemy out of them. Upon his accepting the command of the Carthaginians, the gloomy consternation (says Rolin) which had before seized the whole Army was succeeded by joy and Alacrity. The Soldiers were urgent to be led against the Enemy, in the firm Assurance of being victorious under their new leader and of obliterating the disgrace of   former defeats. Xanthippus did not suffer their ardour to cool but led them on to Battle and entirely routed and deafeated the Romans making Regulas their prisoner. That General who a few days before was insolent with Victory, inexorable to the conquerd, and deaf to all their Remonstrances in a few days experienced by the fate of war a sad reverse of fortune. This is a case I think very similar to our own, may it prove so in the end. Their are two ways says Rolin of acquiring improvement and instruction, first by ones own experience, and secondly by that of other men. It is much more wise and  to improve by other mens miscarriages than by our own. We have not yet Received any  from the Southern Army since the accounts of the engagement on the 11th, whichby the account must have been very severe upon both sides. You now experience what we sufferd when the Army lay this way. I feel very anxious for their Success. The Suspence which the distance occassions is painfull but still I find very different sensations between having the Enemy at such a distance and having them in my own Neighbourhood. I hope you will all look to your own Safety. As you are not calld to action, kidnapping would be rather dissagreable but were you in the Army I should dispise myself for such a Sentiment -- as much as I did a certain Gentleman who was in the Horrours a few days ago upon hearing that General Washington had retreated within six miles of  [Philadelphia]. If How should get possession of that city it would immediately negotiate a peace. I could not help warmly replying, that I did not believe it even tho that should be the case and the General with his whole Army should be cut of. I hoped then that an Army of women would oppose him. I think it was Was it not the Sarassens who turnd their Backs upon the Enemy and were slain by their women who were placed behind them for that purpose? Your  of 2d.  and8th  reachd me upon the 20th. Your observations with regard to Luxery are very just, but trade and commerce will always support it. The  Necessity of the times will be a temporary restraint upon it, and put us upon seeking Resources among ourselves. An instance of that may be seen in the progress which is made of grinding corn storks and boiling the Liquor into Molasses.Scarcly a Town or parish within 40 miles of us but what have several mills at work, and had the experiment been made a month sooner many thousand Barrels would have been made, no less than 80 have already been made in the small Town of  Manchester. It answers very well to distill, and may be boild down to Sugar. There are [illegible]   two mills sitting up in this parish. They have 3 Rollers one with cogs and two smooth, the storks are striped of the leaves and tops so that tis no Robbery upon the cattle, and the juce groundout. but Tis said 4 Barrels of juice will make one of Molasses, but in this people differ widely. They have a method of refining it so that it looks as well as the best imported molasses. Thus you see we go from Step to Step in our improvements. We can live much better than we deserve within ourselves. Why should we borrow foreign Luxeries. Why should we wish to bring ruin upon ourselves. I feel as content when I have Breakfasted upon milk, as  ever I did with Hyson or Suchong.  and sugar I use only as a rarity. There are none of these things but I could totally renounce. My dear Friend knows that I could always conform to times and circumstances. As yet I know nothing of hardships. My children have never cried for Bread, nor been destitute of cloathing -- nor have the poor or the needy gone empty from my Door whenever it was in my power to assist them.  Heaven grant that I may continue to receive its Blessings. One of its greatest is that I can subscribe myself Yours.  "
October 6  [i.e. 5]. 1777. Sunday,"Dearest Friend I know not where to direct to you, but hope you are secure. Tis said in some part of  the Jersies, but I know this only from report. I sent to Town yesterday () but the Post did not get in till the person by whom I sent came out of Town. I could not rest but sent again this morning. The Post came but brought no Letters for me, and but two for any person that I could learn, and no late intelligence. To the removal of congress I attribute my not hearing, but I never was more anxious to hear. I want to know every movement of the Armies. Mr. Niles by whom I send this sets of tomorrow and  to find you and deliver this into your Hand. I doubt not you will let me hear from you by the first conveyance. Tell me where you are, how you are situated and how you do? Whether your spirits are good, and what you think of the present state of our Arms. Will Mr. How get possession of the city? Tis a day of doubtfull expectation, Heaven only knows our destiny. I observe often in the account of actions that our Men are sometimes obliged to retreat for want of ammunition, their  [illegible]  cartridges are spent. How is this? Is it good Generalship. We never hear of that complaint in the regular Army. -- There is a private expedition tis said. The Troops have all marched last monday. I own I have no great faith in it. I wish it may succeed better than I apprehend. No News of any importance from the Northward; I long for spirited exertions . I want some grand important actions to take place. We have both armies from their Shipping. Tis what we have long sought for, now is the important Day; Heaven seems to have granted us our desire, may it also direct us to improve it aright. We are all well. I write nothing of any importance, till I know where you are, and how to convey to you.  Believe me at all times unalterably yours -- yours.  "
October 20. 1777,"Tis true my dearest Friend that I have spent an anxious 3 weeks, and the sight of a Letter from you gave me joy beyond expression. I had sent every post day, and every post was . For 3 weeks I could not learn one word with certainty -- nor can I now determine whether you are 88 miles nearer to me or farther of than you were before. I was greatly  when I heard that the Enemy were in possession of Philadelphia without any engagement upon our part. If Men will not fight and defend their own perticuliar spot, if they will not drive the Enemy from their Doors, they deserve the slavery and subjection which awaits them. There is much I think comprised in that short ,  ""I shall avoid all history and make no reflections."" I think I can construe a volum from it, I will follow the example least a miscarrage of this should give triumph to an Enemy. Our affairs at the Northward wear a more pleasing aspect. The Sunshine from the North gilds the dark Clouds of the South or the Storm would look dismal indeed. It is a   observation that in some late general orders when many motives and stimulatives were set before the men to excite them to action, they were assured of conquest without once acknowledgeing the Superintendance of divine providence. Our favorite Dr. Tillotson  ""observes that in all our concernments we ought to have a perticuliar regard to the Supreme disposer of all things and earnestly to seek his favour and blessing upon all our undertakeings, but more especially in the affairs of war, in which the providence of God is pleasd many times in a very peculiar manner to interpose and interest itself, because all war is as it were an appeal to God, and a reference of those causes to the decision of his providence which through the pride, and injustice, and perverse passions of men can receive no other determination."" Tis not more than 3 weeks since I thought our affairs looked in a more  train than they had done since the commencement of the War.Tho they have not taken the turn I hoped for, yet I doubt not they will  finally terminate in our favour. Providence for wise purposes has oftentimes since the commencement of this war brought about our deliverence by ways and means which have appeard to us the most improbable and unlikely -- has given into our hands those things which we were destitute of, and in the greatest necessity for. So true it is acknowledge him in all thy ways, and he shall direct thy paths. To you my dear Friend I need not excuse these Moral reflections. I have ever  it as a happiness to be united to one whose Sentiments in Religion were not only agreable to my own, but to what I have ever esteemed the Truth. I believe I may venture to congratulate my Love upon the completion of his wishes with regard to . Tis reported to day from many ways that he has with his whole Army fallen into our hands and tis said the post brings the same inteligance. If true, as I most sincerely hope, let us with gratitude acknowledg the interposition of Heaven in our favour. We have accounts too of an engagement at the southard. I am glad to hear of fighting even  we come of second best, not because Heaven is my witness that I delight in the Effusion of humane Blood, but because I believe by delay we should loose more lives than by the sword. It sinks our spirits, disheartens our soldiers, makes them both Idle and wicked. How great would be my joy could I see peace and quietness once more restored to this distressed land. It gave me great pleasure to hear of your Health and Spirits. Did you save your , or have they fallen into the hands of the Enemy? We are all very well in the family. The hooping cough prevails much   and is just comeing into the family. I long for the month of your return to come. I wrote you with regard to B--t  [Brackett] but received no answer. You will let me know, and when to send. Dr. T--s  [Tufts] desires to know if you have received a Letter from him within these two months, he fears that it did not reach you, as it was about the time of your removal. The Spirit of Barter and exchange predominates so much here that people dispose of their own Bodies. Matrimony prevails among all orders and Ages; the scarcity of the Commodity enhances the value. Men are a very scarce article to be sure. Among the late mariages which have taken place and are like to, Miss  to Mr. S--w  [Shaw] last thursday, old Deacon W--b  [Webb] of this Town to a maiden Sister of John Ruggles'es wife, who has lived to the age of 66 unmarried, our Friend Mrs.L--n  [Lincoln] of this Town to Deacon S--r  [Storer] of  Boston, an exceeding good match and much approved of. Numbers of others in the lower class not worth mentioning, but I ask my Cousin P--y  [Polly] S--hs  [Smiths] pardon for omitting her. She marries in about 2 months to a Mr. Gray, a Brother of Mr. Eliss Grays of  B--n  [Boston]. Tis very cold for the Season. We had Snow yesterday and Ice in the Streets this morning. When shall I see my Friend? Tis more than Nine long months since we parted. Shall I send the beginning of ? Heaven grant us a joyfull meeting.  "
"Boston  October 25 1777 
","The  News of the Surrender of General Burgoin and all his Army to our Victorious Troops prompted me to take a ride this afternoon with my daughter to Town to join to morrow with my Friends in thanksgiving and praise to the Supreem Being who hath so remarkably deliverd our Enimies into our Hands. And hearing that an express is to go of tomorrow morning, I have retired to write you a few line's. I have received no letters from you since you left  P--a  by the post, and but one by any private Hand. I have wrote you once before this. Do not fail writing by the return of this express and direct your Letters to the care of my unkle who has been a kind and faithfull hand to me through the whole Season and a constant attendant upon the post office.  is expected in by the middle of the week. I have read many Articles of Capitulation, but none which ever containd so generous Terms before. Many people find fault with them but perhaps do not consider sufficently the circumstances of General Gates, who perhaps by delaying and exacting more might have lost all. This must be said of him that he has followed the golden rule and done as he would wish himself in like circumstances to be dealt with. -- Must not the vapouring Burgoine who tis said possesses great Sensibility, be humbled to the dust. He may now write the Blocade of  Saratago. I have heard it proposed that he should take up his quarters in the old South, but believe he will not be permitted to come to this Town. -- Heaven grant us success at the Southard. That saying of king Richard often occurs to my mind  ""God helps those who help themselves"" but if Men turn their backs and run from an Enemy they cannot surely expect to conquer them. This day dearest of Friends  13 years since we were solemly united in wedlock; 3 years of the time we have been cruelly seperated. I have patiently as I could endured it with the Belief that you were serving your Country, and rendering your fellow creatures essential Benefits. May future Generations rise up and call you Blessed, and the present behave worthy of the blessings you are Labouring to secure to them, and I shall have less reason  to regreat the deprivation of my own perticuliar felicity.  Adieu dearest of Friends adieu.  [The preceding text was added in the handwriting of William Stephens Smith]  "
November 16 1777,"My dearest Friend In a Letter which  to me to Night you chide yourself for neglecting writing so frequently as you had done. Tis true a very long space of near a fortnight past, without my hearing one word from you. I cannot help feeling anxious when such a space elapses without receiving a line, but I have no reason to complain. You have considering your avocations been more attentive than I had reason to expect. I have been more  than formerly of writing by the post as I have never received a Letter from you by that conveyance since you left  Philadelphia. Mr. Coleman brought me  yours of october 25  and  26 . You have before this time received from me one of the same date, since which I have not wrote. I have been too much mortified with a late expedition to write you any perticuliars concerning it. Indeed it was from the begining a subject of Burlesque, oweing I believe to the small opinion most people had of the Heroick talents of the commanders. It was call'd a secret Expedition to  Newport. A fortnight before the troops marchd, there were by all accounts as fine a set of troops collected, as any spiritted commanders could have wishd for, and tis said for 20 Days the Island might have been succesfully (to all appearence) attacked. The publick are very angry as well they may be, and demand an enquiry. I know you will be mortified, because it has been a favorite object with you -- but if you want your Arms  with victory you should not appoint what General Gates calls dreaming deacons to conduct them.  and his troops arrived last week in  Cambridge -- all seems to be quietness at present. From the southard we get no very authentick accounts. To day How and his whole Army are captives! To morrow they have got possession of our forts and weighd the Cheveaux de Frize. No News at all, our Mountabank Story of Captivating  and his Army is come to nothing. The Southern Troops must have some assistance from the Northern before any thing very Brilliant will take place. Providence over rules all things for the best, and will work out our Salvation for us in the wisest and best manner -- provided we perform our Duty. My Brother has had the misfortune to be taken upon his return from a cruise up  the . They had a valuable prize with them loaded with duck and cordage. He was captain of Marines on board the Tartar Capt. Grimes Master, and was carried into  Newfoundland since which we have not heard from him. Now my dear Friend shall I ask you when you will return, a Question I have not asked you for these ten Months. Knowing your determination when you left me I have  patience, and endeavourd to submit to my destiny. By the time this reaches you Eleven months will be Elapsed, and you I hope prepairing for your journey. It will be a tedious one I fear in the depth of winter, but let the thought of the cordial reception you will be assured of meeting warm the cold wintry blasts, and make your return joyfull. You make no mention of receiving any Letters from me for a long time. I hope none have miscarried. I must beg you would write whilst you continue absent. We have had very great rains this fall, and severe cold weather for the Season. A flight of snow yesterday and  as cold as January.  "
March 8 1778,"Tis a little more than 3 weeks since the dearest of Friends and tenderest of Husbands left his solitary partner, and quitted all the fond endearments of  felicity for the dangers of the Sea, exposed perhaps to the attack of a Hostile foe, and o good Heaven can I add to the dark assassin, to the secret Murderer and the Bloody Emissary of as cruel a Tyrant as God in his Riteous judgments ever sufferd to Discrace the Throne of Brittain. I have travelled with you over the wide , and could have landed you safe with humble confidence at your desired Haven, and then have set myself down to have enjoyed a negative kind of happiness, in the painfull part which it has pleased Heaven to allot me, but this intelligance with Regard to that great Philosopher, able Statesman and unshaken Friend of his Country  [illegible]  , has planted a Dagger in my  [illegible]   Breast and I feel with a double Edge the weapon that pierced the Bosom of a Franklin The more distinguished the  the person the greater the inveteracy of these foes of Humane Nature. The Arguments of my Friends to alleviate my anxiety by perswading me that this shocking attempt will put you more upon your Gaurd and render your person more secure than if it had never taken place, is kind in them and has some weight, but my greatest comfort and consolation arrisses from the Belief of a Superintending providence to whom I can with confidence commit you since not a Sparrow falls to the ground without his Notice. Were it not for this I should be misirable and overwhelmed by my fears and apprehensions. Freedom of sentiment the life and soul of Friendship is in a great measure cut of by the Danger of , and the apprehension of Letters falling into the hands of our Enemies. Should this meet with that fate may they Blush for their infamous connextion with a Nation who have renderd themselves infamous and abhorred by a long list of crimes which not all their former atchievements their high atchivements nor the Lusture of former Deeds, nor the tender appellation of parent nor the fond connextion which once subsisted, can ever blot from our remembrance or wipe out  those indellible stains of their cruelty and baseness. They have engraven them with a pen of Iron and Led in a Rock forever. To my  Remember me in the most affectionate terms. I would have wrote to him but my notice is so short that I have not time. Injoin it upon him Never to Disgrace his Mother, and to behave worthy of his Father. Tender as Maternal affection is, it was swallowed up in what I found a stronger, or so intermingld that I felt it not in its full force till after he had left me. I console myself with the hopes of his reaping advantages under the carefull Eye of a tender parent which it was not in my power to bestow upon him. There is nothing material taken place in the politicall world since you left us. This Letter will go by a vessel for  Bilboa from whence you may perhaps get better opportunities of conveyance than from any other place.  The Letter you  to the pilot  came safe to hand. All the little folks are anxious for the Safety of their Pappa and Brother to whom they desire to be rememberd -- to which is added the tenderest Sentiments of affection and the fervent prayers for your happiness and "
May 18 1778,"I have waited with great patience, restraining as much as  every anxious Idea for 3 Months. But now every Vessel which arrives sits my expectation upon the wing, and I pray my Gaurdian Genious to waft me the happy tidings of your Safety and Welfare. Heitherto my wandering Ideas Rove like the Son of Ulissis from Sea to Sea, and from Shore to Shore, not knowing where to find you. Sometimes I fancy'd you upon the Mighty Waters, sometimes at your desired Haven; sometimes upon the ungratefull and Hostile Shore of  Britain, but at all times and in all places under the protecting care and Guardianship of that Being who not only cloathes the lilies of the Feild and hears the young Ravens when they cry, but hath said of how much more worth are ye than many Sparrows, and this confidence which the world cannot deprive me of, is my food by day and my Rest by Night, and was all my consolation under the Horrid Ideas of assassination, the only Event of which I had not thought, and in some measure prepaird my mind. When my Imagination sits you down upon the  Gallick Shore, a Land to which Americans are now bound to transfer their affections, and to eradicate all those national prejudices which the Proud and Haughty Nations whom we once revered, craftily instilld into us whom they once stiled their children; I anticipate the pleasure you must feel, and tho so many leagus distant share in the joy of finding the great Interest of our Country so generously espoused, and nobly aided by so powerfull a Monarck. Your prospects must be much brightned, for when you left your Native Land they were rather Gloomy. If an unwearied Zeal and persevering attachment to the cause of truth and justice, regardless of the allurements of ambition on the one Hand or the threats of calamity on the other, can intitle any one to the Reward of peace, Liberty and Safety, a large portion of those Blessings are reserved for my Friend, in His Native country Land. Difficult as the Day is, cruel as this War has been,  seperated as I am on account of it from the dearest connextion in life, I would not exchange my Country for the Wealth of the  Indies, or be any other than an American tho I might be Queen or Empress of any Nation upon the Globe. My Soul is unambitious of pomp or power. Beneath my Humble roof, Bless'd with the Society and tenderest affection of my dear partner, I have enjoyed as much felicity, and as exquisite happiness as falls to the share of mortals; and tho I have been calld to sacrifice to my Country, I can glory in my Sacrifice, and derive pleasure from my intimate connextion with one who is esteemed worthy of the important trust devolved upon him. Britain as usual has added insult to injustice and cruelty, by what she calls a concilitary plan. From my Soul I  her meaness, but she has lost long ago lost that treasure which a great authority tells us exalteth a Nation, and is receiving the reproaches due to her crimes. I have been much gratified with the perusal of the Duke of Richmonds . Were there ten such Men to be found, in that unhappy island I should still have some hopes that a revolution would take place in favour of the virtuous few; ""and the Laws, the Rights, the Generous plan of power deliverd down, From age to age by our renown'd forefathers"" be again restored to that unhappy Island. I hope by the close of this month to receive from you a large packet. I have wrote twice before this, some opportunities I may miss of, by my distance from the  Capital. I have enjoyed a good share of Health since you left me. I have not  my dear son tho I have often thought of him since I began this Letter, becaus I propose writing to him by this opportunity. I omit many domestick matters becaus I will not risk their comeing to the publick Eye. I shall have a small Bill to draw upon you in the month of june. I think to send it to Mr. MacCrery who by a Letter received since you went away I find is Setled in  Bordeaux in the mercantile way, and I dare say will procure for me any thing I may have occasion for. I wish you would be  so good as to write him a line requesting the favour of him to procure me such things as I may have occasion for, and in addition to the Bills which may be drawn Let him add ten pounds Sterling at a time, if I desire it. The Bills will be at 3 different times in a year. If they should arrive safe they would render me essential service. Our Publick finnances are upon no better footing than they were when you left us. 500 Dollors is now offerd by this Town per Man for 9 Months to recruit the Army, 12 pounds a Month for Farming Labour is the price, and not to be procured under. Our Friends are all well and desire to be rememberd to you. So many tender sentiments rush upon my mind when about to close this Letter to you, that I can only ask you to measure them by those as your which you find in your own Bosome for your affectionate "
"June 10, 1778","Dearest of Friends I should write to you with a much more  Heart if I knew where to find you, but as yet I have no inteligance which can be relied upon. I have already wrote several times, by different ways. It wants but a few days of four months since the Boston saild and in all that time we have received no inteligance with regard to her but what was a week ago printed in a New York paper, viz. that she was taken and carried into  Plimouth. This you may be sure gave me great uneasiness, for tho I was not apprehensive that you would be ill treated, I did not chuse to have you a prisoner at a time when I hoped to hear of your safe arrival in  France. The small pox has gone through the  Town of Boston since you left us, and has taken such a spread through the Country that Hospitals are opened in almost every Town. You will be  I know when  [I] tell you that my Father is now under inoculation in this Town, the whole Farms is an Hospital and he is at Col.  [Quincys]. He is not yet broke out. Mr.  [Wibird] is just recovering from it. Your Worthy Mother is well, and very anxious to hear from you. You will easily observe that I write under great restraint. As to politicks you we have been rather inactive through the winter, but you will have all the News from other Friends. The list of our House and counsel will I suppose surprise you, it does not deserve the term  Motly this year; I believe you may say with Duchea their Names scarcly ever met your Ear before. We have a prospect of a fine Season again. If you are safe in  France direct me into some way to pay  taxes. Besides the tax of 47 pounds 18 & 6 pence there is a continental and town tax which amounts to about 50 pounds more for this year. The price of Labour, I think I formerly mentiond. if Least you did not get the Letter I will mention that tis 12 pounds per month -- I make no comments -- you can make calculations.   I am all anxiety to hear from you. God grant me the happy tidings of your welfare and safety, thus prays your affectionate  "
"Boston  june 18 1778
","My Dear Sir At length my anxiety is relieved and the happy happy tidings of your arrival and safety in  France has  my Ears and blessd my Eyes. By an English paper taken in a prize and carried into  Salem, under the Paris News there is mention made of my Dearest Friends arrival at the abode of the venerable Dr. Frankling. -- What have I not suffered for this month past? The Fear of your being finally lost daily encreased upon my mind, for not the least inteligence could be procured with regard to the  Boston save what our Enemies told us that she was taken and carried into  England. My anxious Friends by their endeavours to console me plainly discoverd their own fears, upon this occasion, but my joy is great in receiving the constant and repeated congratulations of my Friends, and in seeing the unfeigned joy of the countanances of all I meet. The vessel was in general given up as taken or lost. I have wrote to you 7 different times, but of late my Heart so much misgave me that I knew not how to hold my pen, and the distracting thought of not knowing where to find you withheld my Hand. Do not fail of writing to me by every way and opportunity you hear of, if Letters are sent to any other State directed to the president of congress I shall soon get them. I shall wait with impatience till I receive some tidings from the well known hand of my dearest Friend. O When, When will it arrive. But Hush my anxious heart, two days ago I would have  promised to have rested quiet, only to have known that you were in the land of the living. When you think of those you have left behind you, you know where to find them, but I have been wandering from Sea to Sea and from Shoar to Shoar not knowing where to rest. I have the pleasure to tell you that our children and Friends are all well, that my Friends are all well, that my aged Father is upon the recovery from the small pox, which he has pass'd through lightly. As to news the present talk is that commisioners have arrived at  New York.  Of this my Friend may be assured that the Idea of treating with them upon the terms they are supposed to have, is treated with indignation and contempt by every American. We  the Nation that can suppose us so nearly assimilated to them, as to renounce treatys, break the publick Faith and tamely give up that Liberty which we have purchased with our Blood, who whilst they are pretending to hold out the olive Branch with one Hand, extend it only to deceive for Blood, Fire, Slaughter and inhumane cruelties are sealed with the other. Many are now trembling in this Town least a few days should involve them in the same terrors and confusion they have heretofore experienced. Mr. How's movements indicate a remove some where and many suppose  Boston destined for destruction, but  I am not yet of that opinion yet. I have mentioned to you in one Letter that I should have a small Bill to draw upon the commisioners this month, to which Bill I wish you would add ten pounds Sterling in such articles as I may have occasion for. I find by a Letter which I have received since your absence from , that he is setled in the mercantile way at  Bordeaux, which place he represents as the best to purchase Goods. I was thinking to send such Bills to him as may be drawn in your favour and get you at the same time to write to him requesting him to procure me such things as I may write to him for, and to the amount of ten pounds Sterling at a time more than the Bills drawn for Interest, which will be 3 times a year. I wish you would write me with regard to this or any other method you think best. I have allready paid in taxes 47 pounds odd, there is an enormous tax for raising men, which together with the continental Tax amounts to 50 pounds more which must be paid immediately. Labour is 15 and 12 pounds per month. I am very uneasy too, about our . We have no School nor can I procure any instruction for him in Town. I have some thoughts of putting  [him] to Board at his unkles in  Haverhill where there is a very good School, but could   not think of it till I heard from you. I shall now run the venture tho at present I do not see my way to get through all the difficulties which suppose you have discoverd from what I have mentiond. I hope and pray that this may find you and my dear son well, to whom I wrote last week. The Season here is very fine and  a plentifull crop. Adieu.  Remember with unabated ardour her whose chief happiness is calling Herself your affectionate "
June 30  [1778],"Dearest of Friends Shall I tell my dearest that tears of joy  my Eyes this morning at the sight of his well known hand, the first line which has blessed my Sight since the his four months absence during which time I have never been able to learn a word from him, or my dear son till about ten days ago an english paper taken in a prize and brought into  Salem containd an account under the Paris News of your arrival at the abode of Dr. Franklin, and last week a Carteel from  Halifax brought Capt. Welch of the  Boston who informd that he left you well the Eleventh of March, that he had Letters for me but distroyed them, when he was taken, and this is all the information I have ever been able to obtain. Our Enemies have told us the vessel was taken and named the frigate which took her and that she was carried into  Plimouth. I have lived a life of fear and anxiety ever since you left me, not more than a week after your absence the Horrid Story of Doctor Franklins assassination was received from  France and sent by Mr. Purveyance of  Baltimore to Congress and to  Boston. Near two months before that was contradicted, then we could not hear a word from the Boston, and most people gave her up as taken or lost, thus has my mind been agitated like a troubled sea. You will easily Conceive how gratefull to me your favour of April 25 and those of our Son were to me and mine,tho I regret your short warning and the little time you had to write, by which means I know not how you fared upon your Voiage, what reception you have met with, (not even from the Ladies, tho you profess yourself an admirer of them,) and a thousand circumstances which I wish to know, and which are always perticuliarly interesting to [a] near connextion. I must request you always to be minute and to write me by every conveyance. Some perhaps which may appear unlikely to reach  [me] will be the first to arrive. I own I was mortified at so Short a Letter, but I quiet my Heart with thinking there are many more upon their passage to me. I have wrote Seven before this  and some of them very long. Now I know you are Safe I wish myself with you. Whenever you entertain such a wish recollect that I would have willingly hazarded all dangers to have been your companion, but as that was not permitted you must console me in your absence by a Recital of all your adventures, tho methinks I would not have them in all respects too similar to those related of your venerable Colleigue, Whose Mentor like appearence, age and philosiphy must certainly lead the polite scientifick Ladies of  France to suppose they are embraceing the God of Wisdom, in a Humane Form, but I who own that I never yet wish'd an Angle whom I loved a Man, shall be full as content if those divine Honours are omitted. The whole Heart of my Friend is in the Bosom of his partner, more than half a score of years has so riveted  [it] there that the fabrick which contains it must crumble into Dust e'er the particles can be seperated. I can hear of the Brilliant accomplishments of any of my Sex with pleasure and rejoice in that Liberality of Sentiment which acknowledges them. At the same time I regret the trifling narrow contracted Education of the Females of my own country. I haveever entertaind a superiour opinion of the accomplishments of the French Ladies ever since I read the Letters of Dr. Sherbear, who professes that he had in all rather take the opinion of an accomplished Lady in matters of polite writing than the first wits of Itally and should think himself safer with her approbation than of a long List of Literati, and he gives this reason for it that Women have in general more delicate Sensations than Men, what touches them is for the most part true in Nature, whereas men warpt by Education, judge amiss from previous prejudice and refering all things to the model of the ancients, condemn that by comparison where no true Similitud ought to be expected. But in this country   [illegible]  you need not be told how much female Education is neglected, nor how fashonable it has been to ridicule Female learning,tho I acknowledge it my happiness to be connected with a person of a more generous mind and liberal Sentiments. I cannot forbear transcribing a few Generous Sentiments which I lately met with upon this Subject. If women says the writer are to be esteemed our Enemies, methinks it is an Ignoble Cowardice thus to disarm them and not allow them the same weapons we use ourselves, but if they deserve the title of our Friends a tis an inhumane Tyranny to debar them of priviliges of ingenious Education which would also render their Friendship so much the more delightfull to themselves and others us. Nature is seldom observed to be niggardly  of her choisest Gifts to the Sex, their Senses are generally as quick as ours, their Reason as nervious, their judgment as mature and solid. Add but to these natural perfections the advantages of acquired learning what polite and charming creatures would they prove whilst their external Beauty does the office of a Crystal to the Lamp not shrowding but discloseing their Brighter intellects. Nor need we fear to loose our Empire over them by thus improveing their native abilities since where there is most abilities Learning, Sence and knowledge there is always observed to be the most modesty and Rectitude of manners. Whose mentor like appearence age & philosophy  on oft certainly  [illegible]   Ladies of France to suppose they embracing the God of wisdom in a Humane form but I who own that I never yet wish'd an Angle whom I loved a Man, shall be full as content if those divine Honours are omitted. "
" [Braintree,  ca. 15 July 1778]","Dearest of Friends By Mr. Tailor, who has promised me to deliver this with his own hand to you, or  it if necessary, I take the liberty of writing rather more freely than I should otherways venture to do. I cannot think but with pain of being debared this privilidge, the only one left me for my consolation in the many solitary and I may add melancholy hours which pass. I promissed myself a negative kind of happiness whenever I could hear of your safe arrival but alass I find a craveing void left akeing in my Breast, and I find myself some days especially more unhappy than I would even wish an Enemy to be. In vain do I strive to divert my attention, my Heart, like a poor bird hunted from her nest, is still returning to the place of its affections, and fastens upon the object where all its cares and tenderness are centered. I must not expect, I ought not indeed for the sake of your repose to wish to be thus frequently, and thus fondly the subject of your meditation, but may I not believe that you employ a few moments every day from the Buisness and pleasures which surround you in thinking of her who wishes not her existance to survive your affection, who never recollects the cruel hour of seperation but with tears. From whence shall I gather firmness of mind bereft of the amicable prop upon which it used to rest  [illegible]   and acquire fortitude? The subject is too tender to persue. I see it touches your Heart. I will quit it at the midnight hour, and rise in the morning suppressing these too tender sensibilities. Tis 5 month since the Boston sailed during all which time I have only received  two very short Letters  . That you have wrote more I know  you do not mention them. Cautious as tis necessary you should be, methinks you need not be so parsimonious. Friendship and affection will suggest a thousand things to say to an intimate Friend which if ridiculed by an Enemy will only be an other proof among the thousands we already have of a savage barity barbarity. A variety of new scenes must arise the discription of which would afford ample amusement to your domestick Friend. I had the pleasure of drinking tea a few days ago with Sir James Jay and . It was a pleasure to hear so directly from you and my dear Jack. The Gentlemen were very social and communicative. I found they had throughly enterd into the character of my Friend, who they represented as rather  relucttantly entering into the modes and customs of -- and rather conforming from necessity than inclination. They diverted me with an account of the Freedoms and fondness of the. . . . . .for the venerable Doctor. At the same time I could not refrain figuring to myself a grave American republican starting at the sight unaccustomed to such freedoms even from the partner of his youth. After 13 years intimate connexion,  [who can recollect the time when had she laid her hand upon his-a universal Blush would have coverd her.?] -- Much however must be allowed for Forms and Customs which render even dissagreable practise'es familiar. I can even consent that they should practise their Forms upon your Lordship considering your natural fondness for the practise whilst I hold possession of what I think they cannot rob me of. Tis mine by a free gift, mine by exchange, mine by a long possession, mine by merrit and mine by every law humane and divine. If I was sure this would reach you I should say many things which I dare not venture to. I stand corrected if I have said any thing already which I ought not to. I feel myself  whilst my Heart overflows, and longs to give utterance to my pen. Many domestick affairs I wish to consult upon. I have studied for a method of defraying the necessary expences of my family. In no one Instance is a hundred pound L M better than thirteen pounds Six and Eight pence used to be, in foreign Articles no ways eaquel, in taxes but a fourth part as good. Day Labour at 24 shillings per day. What then can you think my situation must be? I will tell you after much embaresment in endeavouring to procure faithfull hands I concluded to put out the Farm and reduce my family as much as posible. I sit about removeing the Tenants from the House, which with much difficulty I effected, but not till I had paid a Quarters Rent in an other House for them. I then with the kind assistance of Dr.  [Tufts] procured two young Men Brothers newly married and placed them as Tenants to the halves retaining in my own Hands only one Horse and two Cows with pasturage for my Horse in summer, and  [Quincy] medow for fodder in winter. At present I have no reason to repent of my situation, my family consists at present of only myself, two children and two Domesticks. Our daughter is at School in Boston, and I wait only to know how I shall be able to discharge my schooling for Master Charles to place him at  Haverhill. Debts are my abhorrance. I never will borrow if any other method can be devised. I have thought of this which I wish you to assent to, to order some saleable articles which I will mention to be sent to the care of my unkle  [Smith]  a small trunk at a time, containing ten or 15 pounds Sterling, from which I may supply my family with such things as I need, and the rest place in the hands of Dr.  [Tufts] Son who has lately come into Trade, and would sell them for me, by which means if I must pay extravagant prices I shall be more upon an eaquel footing with my Neighbours. I have been obliged to make fence this year to the amount of 100 & 50 . I have occasion for only a pair of cart wheels for which I must give 60 pounds Lawfull money. I only mention these few articles to serve as a specimen of the rest. I inquired the price of a new carrage the other day and found it to be no more than 300 pounds Lawfull money -- at this rate I never will ask for a supply of this light commodity from any Body let my situation be what it will. The Season has been fine for grass but for about 3 weeks past we have had a sharp and severe Drouth which has greatly injured our grain and a blast upon english grain with a scarcity for flower so that a loaf which once sold for 4 pence is 4 shillings. Tis rumourd that the French fleet to the amount of 18ten have arrived of  Chesepeak. The Enemy have left  Philidelphia, but for politicks I refer you to the publick Letters which will accompany this. -- Mr. Tailor promisses to bring Letters from you whenever he returns. I am in daily expectation of hearing from you. I lament that you lay so far from the sea ports that you must omit some opportunities of writing.  I will not suppose that with more leisure you have less inclination to write to your affectionate and Lonely Friend "
" [Braintree,  29 September 1778]","It is difficult my dearest Friend at the instant in which the Heart finds itself  of some darling hope, to avoid reflexions that however, our cooler reasons dissaproves. I know not whether the pleasure I had in hearing that you were in Health the 10 of last june, was eaquel to the pain I endured in not receiving one Single line from you by the vessel which arrived last week from  Nants in a passage of fourty days on board of which came a French Gentleman passenger from whom my Friends have kindly collected the state of your Health. If there had not been publick dispatches on board It is  to me to tell you that I have never received a line from you since those which were dated in April,tho I have reason to think you have received several Letters from me. I will not suggest an Idea that you have not wrote, or entertain a suspicion that distance, length of time, change of climate or any other cause could render you less mindfull of your country, less thoughtfull of your Friends or less solicitious for the welfare of your family, since so many hazardous circumstances may have arrisen and deprived me of the repeated testimonies of your affection. I dare aver that the Sea can witness for you that you have not been unmindfull of your Friends. Four vessels bound from  Bordeaux to  Boston have fallen into the hands of the Enemy. I must suppose I have lost letters on board of them.  [illegible]   If I had realized before you left me that the intercourse between us would have been so hazardous, I fear my magninimnity would have faill'd me. Expectation has so long and so often been combatted by dissapointment that I  [feel]  [myself]  unhappy, my Spirits which are were naturally cheerfull are depressed and the enjoyments of life are growing very insiped to me.  Our  affairs which looked so promiseing and so likely to meet with Success have been remarkabley frownd upon in an expedition against the enchanted Island. Neither spirit or conduct were wanting. Every one appeard zealous in the cause and determined by a vigirous effort to crush the vipers who who had all collected together into a fort and gave up their cause as desperate. Count de Estang with his Fleet were to cooperate with our Army. How appeard of with his Fleet. The Count went out to attack him. A most uncommon storm arose, shatterd the Fleet to such a degree that the it was not thought prudent to tarry. This at one stroke put an end to the opperations upon the Island, and our troops returnd mortified enough you may be sure. A small engagement ensued by an attack upon our troops in which they discoverd what they would have done had they been assisted -- but I forbear being minute as you will from News papers and other ways collect better accounts than I can give you. The French Fleet now lie in the Harbour of Boston. The daily supplies which we are obliged to afford them enhances the price of every article of life scarce before but now almost incredibley so. We have had a most uncommon hot and dry season. The months of july and August were the hottest ever known here and have cut of our corn, our potatoes and every other article. The cry for Bread is such as I never heard before. Rye 10 dollors a Bushel, Barly 6, corn not to be had, not one Barrel of cider will be made upon this place this year. The fruit is  [intirely]  [cut]  [of ] [nor]  [will] there be  one  [rason]. all things look melancholy now Flower 50 Dollors per hundred. Sickness is [illegible]  around me the dissentery prevails as much as it did 3 years ago [illegible]  and the neighbourings towns Whilst Scarcity and want threatens us on one hand, the pestilence is rageing on the other. The Dyssentery is as mortal as it was 3 years ago and prevails in the Neighbouring Towns, it has not yet been so mortal in this. All things look gloomy and melancholy arround me. As to my own affairs you may recollect the sum you left with me was between 11 and 12 hundred  7 of which I placed in the publick funds, there was a debt due to the clerk of the court which amounted to 50 dollors which I discharged and another to the Black Smith amounting to 55. My Rate Bill amounted to 49 pounds, and the continental Rate to 15, the ministerial Rate raised by contribution. These sums with the payment of my winter Labourers left me destitute enough but I struggled along hoping to receive some assistance from you in the articles sent for, but never having received any thing I must suppose that I have been unfortunate enough to loose them. I can receive four pounds Lawfull money here for one pound Sterling paid in France. I have therefore run the venture to draw upon you for 50 pounds Sterling payable to my Cousin  [Smith] which order suppose you will receive with this Letter. I  [have] taken this method in preference to  [borrowing] a sum which would subject me  [to] the payment of Interest, and perhaps I might  [be] calld upon for it when it would not be in  [my] power to discharge it. You will keep in mind my dear sir that you may not think  [me] lavish that the 2 hundred Lawfull is not  [eaquel] to what 2 hundred old tenor once was. Those who purchase with hard money give for every necessary of life more than double what it formerly sold for. I shall if I can have patience to  send Duplicates of this Letter.  I enclose to you some papers and the kind remembrance of all your Friends. "
" [Braintree,  21 October 1778]","How dear to me was the  Signature of my Friend  this Evening received by the Boston a ship more  valued to me than all the American Navy besides, valuable for conveying safely my choisest comfort, my dearest Blessings. ""I Love the place where Helen was but born."" You write me that you have by several vessels  me tokens of your Friendship. The only Letters I have received from you or my dear Son were dated last April and containd only a few lines -- judge then what my Heart has sufferd. You could not have sufferd more upon your Voyage than I have felt  out of from all communication with you. My Harp has been hung upon the willows, and I have scarcly ever taken my pen to write but the tears have flowed faster than the Ink. I have wrote often to you but was unfortunate enough to have my last and largest packets distroyd the vessel being taken and carried into  Halifax. Mr. Ingraham of  Boston will convey this to you with his own hand. You will I know rejoice to see him as a Bostonian, an American and a Man of Merit, I need not ask you to notice him. but I apprehend that this will never   reach you yet this apprehension shall not prevent my writing by every opportunity. The French Ships are still in the Harbour of  Boston. I have received great civility and every mark of Respect that it has been in the power of their officers to shew me.  [illegible]    has been exceeding polite to me, he took perticulir care to see me, sending an officer to request I would meet him at Col.  [Quincys] as it was inconvenient to be at a greater Distance from his ship. I according waited upon his Excellency who very politely received me, insisted upon my Dineing on board his Ship, appointed his day and sent his Barge, requested I would bring any of my Friends with me. We made up a company of 13 and waited upon him. An entertainment fit for a princiss was prepared, we spent a most agreable day. The Count him is a most agreable Man, Sedate, polite, affible with a dignity that is lost in Ease yet his brow at times would be overclouded with cares and anxieties so like a dear absent Friends   that I was pained for him. But I determine to write you more perticuliarly by an other opportunity. I lament the loss of my last packet. I hate to write duplicates. Our Friends here are all well. Let me intreat you to write me more Letters at a time, sure you cannot want subjects. They are my food by day and my rest by night.  Do not deal them so spairingly to your own "
" [Braintree,  25 October 1778]","The Morning after I received your very short Letter I determined to have devoted the day in writing to my Friend but I had only just Breakfasted when I had a visit from  an officer on board the Langudock who speaks English well, the Captain of the Zara and 6 or 8 other officers from on Board thean other ship. The first Gentlemen dined with me and spent the day so that I had no opportunity of writing that day. The Gentlemen officers have made me several visits and I have dined twice on board at very Elegant entertainments. Count dEstaing has been exceeding polite to me. Soon after he arrived here I received a Message from him requesting that I would meet him at Col.  [Quincy's] as it was inconvenient leaving his ship for any long time. I waited upon him and was very politely received. Upon parting he requested that the family would accompany me on board his Ship and dine with him the next thursday with any Friends we chose to bring and his Barge should come for us. We went according to the invitation and were sumptuously entertaind with every delicacy that this country produces and the addition of every foreign article that could render our feast Splendid. Musick and dancing for the young folks closed the day. The temperance of these Gentlemen, the peaceable quiet disposition both of officers and men joined to many other virtues which they have   [during] their continuance with us, is sufficent to make Europeans and Americans too blush at their own degeneracy of manners. Not one officer has been seen the least disguised with Liquour since their arrival. Most that I have seen appear to be gentlemen of family and Education. I have been the  [more] desirous to take notice of them as I cannot help saying that they have been neglected in the town of  Boston. Generals Heath and Hancock have done their part, but very few if any private families have any acquaintance with them. Perhaps I feel more anxious to have them distinguished on account of the near and dear  I have among them. It would gratify me much if I had it in my power to entertain every officer in the Fleet. In the very few lines I have received from you not the least mention is made that you have ever received a line from me. I have not been so parsimonious as my Friend, perhaps I am not so prudent but I cannot take my pen with my Heart overflowing and not give utterance to some of the abundance which is in it. Could you after a thousand fears and anxieties, long expectation and  suspences be satisfied with my telling you that I was well, that I wished you were with me, that my daughter sent her duty, that I had orderd some articles for you which I hoped would arrive &c. &c. -- By Heaven if you could you have changed Hearts with some frozen Laplander or made a voyage to a region that has chilld every Drop of your Blood. -- But I will restrain a pen already I fear too rash, nor shall it tell you how much I have sufferd from this appearance of inattention. The articles sent by  Tucker have arrived safe and will be of great service to me. on Our Money is very little better than blank paper, it takes 40 dollors to purchase a Barrel of cider, 50 pounds Lawfull for a 100 of Sugar and 50 dollors for a hundred of flower, 4 dollors per day for a Labourer and find him 5 which will amount to 4 more. You will find by Bills drawn before the date of this that I had taken the method which I was happy in finding you had directed me to. I shall draw for the rest as I find my situation requires. No article that can be named foreign or domestick but what costs more than  double in hard money what it once sold for. In one Letter I have given you an account of our Local Situation, and of every thing I thought you might wish to know. 4 or 5 sheets of paper wrote to you by the last Mail were distroyd when she was taken. Duplicates are my Aversion tho   I believe I should set a value upon them if I was to receive them from a certain Friend, since so little a Friend who never was deficient, in testifying his regard and affection to his "
" [Braintree,  12-23 November 1778]","I have taken up my pen again to relieve the anxiety of a Heart too  for its own repose, nor can I help complaining to my Dearest Friend that his painfull absence is not as formerly alleiviated by the tender tokens of his Friendship, 3 very short Letters only have reachd my Hands during 9 months absence. I cannot be so unjust to his affection as to suppose he has not wrote much oftener and more , but must sit down to the Score of misfortune that so few have reachd me. I cannot charge myself with any deficiency in this  sense as I have never let an opportunity slip without writing to you since we parted, tho you make no mention of having received a line from me; if they are become of so little importance as not to be worth noticeing yourself with your own Hand, be so kind as to direct your Secretary I will not finish the , my Heart denies the justice of the acqusation, nor does it believe your affection in the least diminished by distance or absence, but my Soul is wounded at a Seperation from you, and my fortitude all dissolved in frailty and weakness. When I cast my Eye thoughts across the Atlantick and view the distance, the dangers and Hazards which you have already passd through, and to which you must probably be again exposed, e'er we shall meet again, the Time of your absence unlimitted, all all conspire to cast a Gloom over my solitary hours, and bereave me of all domestick felicity. In vain do I strive to through of  [throw off] in the company of my Friends some of the anxiety of my Heart, it increases in proportion to my endeavours to conceal it; the only alleiviation I know of would be a frequent intercourse by Letters unrestrained by the apprehension of their becomeing food for our Enemies. The affection I feel for my Friend is of the tenderest kind, matured by years, sanctified by choise and approved by Heaven. Angles can witness to its purity, what care I then for the Ridicule of Britains should this testimony of it fall into their Hands, nor can I endure that so much caution and circumspection on your part should deprive me of the only consolation consolor of your absence -- a consolation that our Enemies enjoy in a much higher degree than I do,   Many of them having received 3 or 4 Letters from their Friends in  England to one that I have received from  France. Thus far I wrote more than ten days ago, my mind as you will easily see far from tranquil, and my Heart so wounded by the Idea of inattention that the very Name of my  would draw tears from me. Forgive me for harbouring an Idea so unjust, to your affection. Were you not dearer to me than all this universe contains beside, I could not have sufferd as I have done, But your Letters of  April 12 , of  June 3  and  June 16  calmd my Soul to peace. I cannot discribe the Effect they had upon me, cheerfullness and tranquility took place of greif and anxiety. I placed them Next my Heart and  [illegible]   soothed myself to rest with the tender assurences of a Heart all my own. I was not a little mortified to find that the  few Lines  wrote by way of  Holland were the only ones you had received from me, when I had wrote many sheets of paper long before that time and sent by so many different hands that I thought you must have heard often from me,  But this circumstance will make me more cautious how I suffer such cruel Ideas to hound me again. Tis the 23 of November now.  has saild near a fortnight, Biron with 15 sail lay upon the watch for him, but a very terrible Storm prevented the Count from sailing, and shatterd Birons Fleet. 11 Sail only have arrived at  Newport, the Somerset was lost upon  Nantucket Shoals. I fed many of the prisoners upon their march to  Boston. About 40 were drowned, the rest deliverd themselves as prisoners. The two other ships which are missing were supposed to be lost there, as the Hulks appear and a 50 gun ship which came out with Biron from  England was has not been heard of since. Thus they have made a fine voyage of watching dEstaing, lost 3 capital ships, never saw the French Fleet, returnd into port with one Ship dismasted and the rest much damaged. Heaven continue to be propitious to our Friends and allies for whom I have contracted a most sincere regard. If chastity, temperance, , frugality, sobriety and purity of morals, added to politeness and complasance can entitle any people to Friendship and respect, the Behaviour of this whole Fleet whilst they lay in this harbour which was more than two months, demand from every unprejudiced person an acknowledgment of their merrit. If I ever had any national prejudices they are done away and I am ashamed to own I was ever possessd of so narrow a spirit -- and I  [illegible]  blush to find so many of my country men possessd with such low vulgar prejudices and capable of such mean reflections as I have heard thrown out against the Nation of our allies though the unblamable conduct of this Fleet left them not one personal reflexion to cast. Let me Imitate and instill it into my children the Liberal Spirit of that great Man who declared he had no Local attachments. It is indifferent to me says he whether a man is rocked in his cradle on this Side of the Tweed, or on that, I seek for  whereever it is to be found. Detested be national reflexions, they are unjust. "
December 13  [1778],"By the alliance (a fine frigate Built in  Newbury port commanded by  a Native of  France) I hope this will reach you and by her you will have a good opportunity of conveying any thing you please to me. I have wrote so often and met with so little encouragement by a return that if I really believed one half you wrote, reachd my Hands I should through my pen aside as an impertinent intruder upon hours more agreably imployed. Barns we have reason to think is either lost or taken, if Ayers has  he may have shared the same fate as neither of them have arrived. Two vessels lay ready to sail from  Boston by both of whom them I have wrote. One is called the 3 Friends Bound for  Port Orient, the other goes to  Holland I believe where perhaps you will receive orders to go before this reaches you. I cannot say I am gratified by the removal. The climate of  France is more agreable I believe to your Health, and I fear I shall hear from you if possible seldomer than at present, but neither your own pleasure or satisfaction or my comfort or conveniency are to be consulted. Those were long ago sacrificed to the publick to whom you are devoted and wherever that service can best be  [promoted] there it is your duty to repair, mine to acquiese - mine to attend you whenever you think your own comfort, pleasure or satisfaction can be promoted by it, and I can comethat I could come to you with any degree of safety. This is my wish tho I had much rather have accompanied you than follow you. -- I have enjoyed a tolerable good state of Health, Depression of spirits I often experience from the state of anxiety in which I live. Domestick cares some times oppress me, you have directed me to a method which will in some measure relieve me from them. The miserable state of our currency adds to our other difficulties, a hundred Dollors is on will not purchase what ten formerly would, common sugar is 200 dollors per hundred, flower 50, cider 12 pounds a Barrel, and other articles in proportion. Taxes very high. Should I tell you that it cost me a hundred dollors to new shingle one side of a Barn you would scarcly credit it, yet it is as true as astonishing. Whilst I am studying frugality and economy, I look round me and see others living in dissapation and greater extravagance than ever, sitting up Equipages  [ . . . ]  and dazling the world with their glare. This year has not been a very glorious one to  America. The unfortunate failure of their Expedition against  Rhoad Island shagrined, mortified and  to such a degree that they cannot yet mention it with patience, for they had every humane appearence of being crownd with Success and victory. Our Arms have rather been imployed in the defensive way. Our Enemies however have nothing to boast of since they have not gained one inch of territory more than they possessd a year ago and are at least  Philadelphia out of pocket. What the winter may produce I know not. I wish it would give us peace but do not expect it. In your last Letter you mention having sent some articles several times but do not say by whom. I have not received any thing but by  Tucker. There is no remittances you can make me which will turn to a better account than Goods, more especially such articles as I enclose a list of but I believe a ship of war is the safest conveyance for them. Doctor Tufts son has lately sit up in Trade, whatever I receive more than is necessary for family use I can put into his hands which will serve both him and my -- self. I have wrote so lately and so  that I have nothing further to add than to request you to write by every opportunity and that with more leisure than you seem to have done. A short Letter always gives one pain as well as pleasure since a few lines only from such a distance looks as if the Friend we wrote to possessd but a small share of our attention and regard. All your Friends complain of you. You should recollect that you have carried with you all my pleasures all my amusements that in the absence of a certain Friend all pleasures and amusements are tasteless, all loose their relish, that I have not one left eaquel to  [that] of receiving from your own hand assurances  [of]  [your] affection and regard -- that tis the only  [consolation] for an absence to which I know no limits. I should be obliged to you if you would mention the dates of Letters you receive from your affectionate "
Sunday Evening December 27 1778,"How lonely are my days? How solitary are my Nights? Secluded from all Society but , and my domesticks, by the Mountains of snow which surround me I could almost fancy myself in  Greenland. We have had four of the coldest Days I ever knew, and they were followed by the severest snow storm I ever knew remember, the wind blowing like a Hurricane for 15 or 20 hours renderd it imposible for Man or Beast to live abroad, and has blocked up the roads so that they are impassible. A week ago I parted with  at the request of our  [Plymouth] Friends to spend a month with them, so that I am solitary indeed. Can the best of Friends recollect that for 14 years past, I have not spent a whole winter alone. Some part of the Dismal Season has heretofore been Mitigated and Softned by the Social converse and participation of the Friend of my youth. How insupportable the Idea that 3000 , and the vast ocean now devide us -- but devide only our persons for the Heart of my Friend is in the Bosom of his partner. More than half a score years has so rivetted it there, that the Fabrick which contains it must crumble into Dust,e'er the particles can be seperated. I cannot  to you How much I was affected the other day with a Scotch song which was sung to me by a young Lady in order to divert a Melancholy hour, but it had a quite different Effect, and the Native Simplicity of it, had all the power of a well wrought Tradidy  [tragedy]. When I could conquer my Sensibility I beg'd the song, and Master Charles has learnt it and  consoles his Mamma by singing it to her. I will enclose it to you. It has Beauties in it to me, which an indifferent person would not feel perhaps Gracious Heaven hear and answer my daily petition, ""by banishing all my Grief."" I am sometimes quite discouraged from writing. So many vessels are taken, that there is Little chance of a Letters reaching your Hands. That I meet with so few returns is a circumstance that lies heavy at my Heart. If this finds its way to you, it will go by the Alliance. By her I have wrote before, she has not yet , and I love to amuse myself with my pen, and pour out some of the tender sentiments of a Heart over flowing with affection, not for the Eye of a cruel Enemy who no doubt would ridicule every Humane and Social Sentiment long ago grown Callous to the finer sensibilities --  but for the sympathetick Heart that Beats in unison with PS I  Mr. Blodget the Bearer of this will have a Bill upon you, in favour of yours.  "
Janry. 2 1779,"My Dearest Friend You  directed me to draw Bills upon you for what Money I want, and add, that if my Bills are scrupled, to get them indorsed. I thank you sir, but I have no occasion for an indorser. My credit will last here; till it fails upon the other side of the water, I should find no difficulty in selling many more Bills than you would chuse to pay. I have had various applications to me for Bills, but not a single six pence can I get of substantial coin. That is kept up as choise as the life Blood; if our currency was two weeks together upon the same footing, I should not so much regard receiving it for Bills. Merchants do not care to buy small Bills, and if I draw for more than I have immediate use for, it sinks in my hands.  Remittances made in goods, provided it could be done with any safety, will fetch hard Money, or may be parted with as occasion requires. Every article either of Merchandise or provision has been rising for this Month. I had occasion for a Sum of Money to discharge my last years accounts and to provide some family stores, which has obliged me to draw a Bill upon you in  of Mr. Blodget who is in the Alliance, to the amount of a 100 pounds which added to the Bill I drew in favour of Smith and Codman amounts to 2 hundred pounds Lawfull Money. I hope you will not think me extravagant, I could account for the expenditure of every shilling to your satisfaction; I will give you one instance of prices here. Yesterday I gave 12 pounds  Money for one pound of Bohea tea and 14 pounds of ordinary brown sugar. Our crops were so cut of by the drought, and distroyed by the Storm, that 23 Bushels of corn is the sum total of my last years crop. Not a single  Barrel of cider was made upon the Farm. I do not exaggerate when I say that 100 and hundreds of families have not a mouth full of Bread to eat. Grain is not to be had at any rate in this State and the Embargoes of other States, has hitherto prevented any supplies. My determination was, that the Bills I had already drawn should answer all the purposes of the last year; but last Night  the Bearer of this Letter, and your former pupil, applied to me for a Bill in his favour, but I declined, as I had lately made so large a Draught, and had paper sufficent for all my present Demands. He then offerd me ten guineas if I would draw a Bill for them. As I knew I should be no loser by having hard money in my Hands I consented to draw for that, and have accordingly given him a Bill. Both my unkle and Genll. [Warren] had been trying a month for me, but not a shining morsal could they procure for me, nor will they give near so much in paper as dollors sell for, which I think a very great hardship. If on any occasion I should be offerd gold and silver for Bills I shall venture to draw, but will not exceed 2 hundred Lawfull Money yearly if I can posibly avoid it -- and if I should receive the articles you say you have orderd for me, I may not perhaps have occasion for near that Sum. I have given to Mr. Williams a List of articles 2 nearly the same which I have sent to you and if you give him leave, he will purchase and convey them to me, he has also promised to take perticular care to convey any Letters you may wish to send from time to  time. The publick packet in which Capt. Ayers went to  France arrived at  Cape Ann, and was in the most voilent Storm ever known here, drove ashore, happily no one perish'd. Capt. Ober who I find now commands her, has not got to  Boston yet. I expect Letters by him -- what shall I attribute it to if I have not? My dissapointment will be great, yet should their be a paper addressed to me, and enclosed should I find what may properly be termd a Letter, my agreable dissapointment will be great indeed. Surely I have been the most unfortunate person in the world, to loose every Letter you have wrote me since your absence, and to receive only a few lines at various times wrote in the greatest haste, containing only the state of your Health, perhaps making mention of your Son and Servant and then concluding abruptly yours.   I determine very soon to  and adopt the very concise method of my Friend -- and as I wish to do every thing agreable to him, send him Billits containing not more than a dozen lines at the utmost Especially as paper has grown so dear, which will afford some coulour of an excuse to his most affectionate PS Mr. Williams goes in the vessel  the 3 Friends. I wrote Letters by her a month ago and supposed she was gone. My Love to my Son he will find letters for him on board the same vessel. "
Febry. 13. 1779,"My Dearest Friend This is the Anniversary of a very melancholy Day to me, it rose upon me this morning with the recollection of Scenes too tender to Name. -- Your own Sensibility will supply your Memory and dictate to your pen a kind remembrance of those dear connections to whom you waved an adeiu, whilst the full Heart and weeping Eye followed yours, foot steps till intervening objects obstructed the Sight. This Anniversary shall ever be more particularly Devoted to my Friend till the happy Day arrives that shall give him back to me again. Heaven grant that it may not be far distant, and that the blessings which he has so unweariedly and constantly sought after may crown his  and bless his country. It is with double pleasure that I hold my pen this day to acquaint my Friend that I have had a rich feast indeed, by the Miflin privateer, which arrived here the 8th of this month and brought his Letters of 9 of , 23 of october, 2d of November,  2d of December  all together making more than I have received since your absence at one time. The Hankerchiefs in which the were tied felt to me like the return of an absent Friend -- tis Natural to feel an affection for every thing which belongs to those we love, and most so when the object is far -- far distant from us. You chide me for my complaints, when in reality I had so little occasion for them. I must  you to attribute it to the real cause -- an over anxious Solicitude to hear of your welfare, and an ill grounded fear least multiplicity of publick cares, and avocations might render you less attentive to your pen than I could wish. But bury my dear Sir, in oblivion every expression of complaint -- erase them from the Letters which contain them, as I have from my mind every Idea so contrary to  that regard and affection you have ever manifested towards me. -- Have you a coppy of your Letter December the 2d. Some dissagreable circumstances had agitated your mind News from  Rhoad Island -- or what? Why was I not by to sooth my Friend to placidness -- but I unhappily had contributed to it. With this consideration I read those passages, which would have been omited had the Letter been coppied. And does my Friend think that there are no hopes of peace? Must we still endure the Desolations of war with all the direfull consequences attending it. -- I fear we must and that  America is less and less worthy of the blessings of peace.  that bainfull poison has unstrung and enfeabled her sons. The soft penetrating plague has insinuated itself into the freeborn mind, blasting that noble ardor, that impatient Scorn of base subjection which formerly distinguished your Native Land, and the Benevolent wish of general good is swallowed up by a Narrow selfish Spirit, by a spirit of oppression and extortion. Nourished and supported by the flood of paper which has nearly overwhelmed us, and which depreciates in proportion to the exertions to save it, and  so necessary to us is of less value than any commodity whatever, yet the demand for it is beyond conception, and those to whom great sums of it have fallen, or been acquired, vest it in Luxurys, dissapate it in Extravagance, realize it at any rate. But I hope the time is not far distant when we shall in some measure be extricated from our present difficulties and a more virtuous spirit succeed the unfealing dissapation which at present prevails, And America shine with virtuous citizens as much as she now deplores her degenerate sons.   Enclosed you will find a Letter wrote at your request, and if rewarded by your approbation it will abundantly gratify your  "
March 20  [1779],"My Dearest Friend Your  of December 9 came to hand this Evening from  Philadelphia, by the same post received a Letter from Mr. [Lovell] transcribing some passages from one of the same date to him, and the only one he says which he has received since your absence, and his pocket proves that he has written 18teen different times, yet possibly you may have received as few from him; the watery world alone can boast of large packets received, a Discourageing thought when I take my pen. Yet I will not be discouraged, I will persist in writing tho but one in ten should reach you. I have been impatient for an opportunity, none having offerd since janry. when the Alliance saild, who my presaging mind assures me will arrive safe in  France, and I hope will return as safely. Accept my thanks for the care you take of me in so kindly providing for me. The articles you mention should they arrive safe, will be a great assistance to me. The safest way you tell me of supplying my wants  is by Draughts, but I cannot get hard Money for Bills. You had as good tell me to procure Diamonds for them, and what when Bills will fetch but five for one, hard Money will exchange ten -- which I think is very provoking and I must give at the rate of ten and sometime 20 for one for every article I purchase. I blush whilst I give you a price current, all Butchers meat from a Dollor to 8 shillings per pound, corn 25 Dollars, Rye 30 per Bushel, flower 50 pounds per hundred, potatoes ten dollors per Bushel, Butter 12 shillings per pound, cheese 8, Sugar 12 shillings per pound, Molasses 12 Dollors per Gallon, Labour 6 and 8 Dollors a Day, a common Cow from 60 to 70 pound, and all English goods in proportion. This is our present situation. It is a risk to send me any thing across the water I know, yet if one in 3 arrives I should be a gainer. I have and do study every method of  in my power, otherways a mint of money would not support a family. and -- I could not board our two sons under 40 donors per week a peice at a school. I therefore thought it most prudent to request Mr. [Thaxter] to look after them, giving him his board and the use of the office -- which he readily accepted and having passd the winter with me, will continue through the summer, as I see no probability of the times speedily growing better. We have had much talk of peace through the mediation of  Spain, and great News from  Spain, and a thousand reports as various as the persons who tell them, yet I believe slowly, and rely more upon the information of my Friend, than all the whole Legend  which rise with the sun, and set as soon. Respecting Gorgia other Friends have wrote you, shall add nothing of my own but that I believe it will finally be a fortunate Event to us. Our Vessels have been fortunate in making prizes,  many were taken in the fall of the year, we have been greatly distressd for Grain. I scarcly know the looks or taste of Bisquit or flower for this four months, yet thousands have been much worse of, having no grain of any sort. The great commotion  here by Mr. [Deane] has sunk into contempt for his character, and it would be better for him to leave a country which is now supposed to have been injured by him. His Friends are silent, not knowing how to extricate him. It would be happy for him if he had the art himself -- he most certainly had art enough in the begining to blow up a flame and to set the whole continent in agitation. More than a Month has past away since writing the above and no opportunity has yet  of conveying you a line. Next to the pain of not receiving is that of not being able to send a token of remembrance and affection. (You must excuse my  [not] coppying as paper is ten dollors per quire.) Last week a packet arrived from  Brest with dispatches for Congress but no private Letters. I was dissapointed, but did not complain. You would have wrote I know had you supposed she was comeing to Boston. By her we heard of the safe arrival of the Alliance in  France which gave me much pleasure, may she have as safe a return to us again. Last week arrived here the Frigate Warren after a successfull cruize. She had been out about 6 weeks in company with the Queen of France  and the Ranger, Capt. Jones. They fell in with and captured a Fleet bound from  New York to  Georgia consisting of Ship Jason 20 Guns 150 Men, Ship Maria 16 Guns 84 Men, having on board 1800 Barrels of flower, privateer schooner Hibernian 8 Guns and 45 Men, Brigs Patriot, Prince Fredirick,Batchelor John and Schooner Chance, all of which are safe arrived to the universal joy and satisfaction of every well wisher of their country. The officers who were captured acknowledge that this loss will be most severely felt by the Enemy, and it is hoped will give General Lincoln important advantages against the enemy in  Georgia. Respecting  affairs I shall do tolerably whilst my credit is well supported abroad and my demands there shall be as small as possible considering the state of things here, but I cannot purchase a Bushel of grain under 3 hard Dollors,tho the scarcity of that article makes it dearer than other things. Our Friends here all desire to be  to you. I remind  your daughter of writing and she promises to, but she does not Love it. Charlly is very busy a gardening, sends his Duty and hopes to write soon. -- My pen is very bad, but you are so used to the hand you can pick it out, and if it goes into the sea it will be no matter. I should be very glad of some wollens by the Alliance for winter Gowns. Nothing will be amiss, unless it is Mens white silk stockings which I have no occasion for, and suppose the pair sent among the Letters which came in the Miflin an accident. My pen is really so bad that I cannot add any further than that I am  yours.   "
June 8th 79,"My Dearest Friend Six Months have already elapsed since I heard a syllable from you or , and five since I have had one single opportunity of conveying a line to you. Letters of various dates have lain months at the Navy Board, and a packet and Frigate both ready to sail at an hours warning have been months waiting the orders of Congress. They no doubt have their reasons, or ought to have for detaining them. I must patiently wait their Motions however painfull it is-and that it is so your own feelings will testify. Yet I know not but you are less a sufferer than you would be to hear from us, to know our distresses and yet be unable to relieve them. The universal cry for Bread to a Humane Heart is painfull beyond Discription, and the great price demanded and given for it, verifies that pathetick passage of sacred writ, all that a Man hath will he give for his life. Yet he who Miraculously fed a Multitude with 2 loaves and 5 fishes has graciously interposed in our favour and deliverd many of the Enimies supplies into our hands so that our distresses have been Mitigated. I have been able as yet to supply my own family spairingly but at a price that would astonish you. Corn is sold at 4 dollors hard money per Bushel which is eaquel to 80 at the rate of exchange.  is at 8 dollors per Day and in 3 weeks at 12 tis probable, or it will be more stable than any thing else. Goods of all kinds are at such a price that I hardly dare mention it-Linnins at 20 dollors per yard the most ordinary sort calicow at 30 and 40, Broad cloths sold at 40 pounds per yard-West India goods full as high, Molasses at 20 dollors per Gallon, sugar 4 dollors per pound, Bohea Tea at 40 dollors and our own produce in proportion, Butchers meat at 6 and 7 and 8 dollars shillings per pound, Board at 50 and 60 dollors per week. Rates 2 high, that I suppose you will rejoice at, so would I, did it remedy the Evil. I pay 5 hundred Dollors, and a New continental rate has just appeard, my proportion of which will be a hundred more. I have come to this determination to sell no more Bills unless I can   procure hard money for them altho I shall be obliged to allow a discount. If I sell for paper I through away more than half, so rapid is the depreciation, nor do I know that it will be received long. I sold a Bill to Blodget at 5 for one which was lookd upon  [as] high at that time. The week after I received it, two Emissions were taken out of circulation and the greater part of what I had proved to be of that sort, so that those to whom I was indebted are obliged to wait and before it becomes due or is exchanged, it will be good for -- as much as it will fetch, which will be nothing if it goes on as it has done for this 3 Months past, but I will not tire your patience any longer. I have not drawn any further upon you, I mean to wait the return of the Alliance which with longing Eyes I wait for. God grant it may bring me comfortable tidings from my dear dear Friend whose welfare is so essential to my happiness that it is entwined round my Heart, and cannot be impared or seperated from it without rending it assunder. In contemplation of my situation I am sometimes thrown into an agony of distress. Distance, dangers -- and O! I cannot name all the fears which sometimes oppress me and harrow up my soul. Yet must the common Lot of Man one day take place whether we dwell in our own Native Land, or are far distant from it. That we rest under the shadow of the Almighty is the consolation to which I resort, and find that comfort which the World cannot give. If he sees best to give me back my Friend, or to preserve my life to him, it will be so. Our worthy Friend  is numberd with the great congregation to the inexpressible loss of Harvard College. The Testimony he gave with his  Breath in favour of revealed Religion, does honour to his memory and will endear it to every Lover of Virtue. I know not who will be found worthy to succeed him. Our Brother Cranch is immersd in Buisness -- and so cumbered with it that that he fears He shall not be able to write you a line.  [illegible]    have not yet made any appointment of you to any other court. There appears a dilatoryness, an indisicion in their proceedings. I have in Mr. [Lovell] an attentive Friend who kindly informs me of every thing which passes relative to you and your situation, gives me extracts of your Letters both to himself and others. I know you will be unhappy whenever it is not in your power to serve your country -- and wish yourself at home where at least you might serve your family. -- I cannot say that I think our affairs go very well here. Our currency seems to be the source of all our Evils. We cannot fill up our continental Army by means of it, no bounty will prevail with them. What can be done with it, it will sink in less than a year. The advantages the Enemy daily gain over us is oweing to this. Most truly did you prophesy when you said that they would do all the mischief in their power with the forces they had here. Many Letters lay in  Boston for you which have been wrote Months. My good   [Smith] yesterday let me know that a Letter of Mark bound for  Nants would sail in a day or two. I eagerly seaze the opportunity and beg you to give my blessing to my son to whom I have not time now to write. I dare not trust myself with the Idea nor can express how ardently I long to see both the parent and son. Our whole family have enjoyed great Health since your absence. Daughter and sons who dayly delight themselves with talking of Pappa and  Brother present their Duty and Love. Your Worthy Mamma who is now here requests me to add her tenderest affection to you, who next to the writer is anxious to hear from you. Your Brother requests me to desire you to procure for him 2 peices of Linnin to the amount of 24 dollors which he will pay to me, and to send them whenever you have an opportunity of sending to me. I shall not write for any thing till the Alliance returns and I find what success she has had.   My tenderest regards ever attend you in all places and situations know me to be ever ever yours. "
November 14. 1779,"Dearest of Friends My habitation, how disconsolate it looks! My table I set down to it but cannot swallow my food. O Why was I born with so much Sensibility and why possessing it have I so often been  to struggle with it? I wish to see you again, was I sure you would not be gone, I could not withstand the temptation of comeing to town, tho my Heart would suffer over again the cruel torture of Seperation. What a cordial to my dejected Spirits were the few lines last night received. And does your Heart forebode that we shall again be happy. My hopes and fears rise alternately. I cannot resign more than I do, unless life itself was called for. --  I can not think of them without a tear, little do they know the feelings of a Mothers Heart! May they be good and usefull as their Father then will they in some measure reward the anxiety of a Mother. My tenderest Love to them. Remember me also to Mr. Thaxter whose civilities and kindness I shall miss.   God almighty bless and protect my dearest Friend and in his own time restore him to the affectionate Bosom of "
December 10. 1779,"My Dearest Friend I will not omit any opportunity of writing  ever so great an uncertainty whether it will ever reach your Hand. My Unkle Smith has a vessel bound to  Calis, he advises me to write, and I most willingly comply tho my Faith in the conveyance is but poor -- indeed I have lost my Faith with my Spirits. My Friends assure me from their observations that you must have had a good passage. God grant it I say, but my fears and anxieties are many -- very many. I had a Faith and reliance before that supported me, but now my Heart so misgives me that I cannot find that confidence which I wish for. Your Letter from  Cape Ann arrived and cheered my drooping Spirits. Could I hear of your safe arrival, I would try to compose my agitated mind which has  both day and night. My dear sons, Little do they know how many veins of their Mothers Heart bled when she parted from them. My delicate Charles, how has he endured the fatigues of his voyage? John is a hardy Sailor, seasoned before, I do not feel so much for him. Your fellow Travellers too I do not forget to think of them. I will not wish myself with you because you say a Lady cannot help being an odious creature at sea, and I will not wish myself in any situation that should make me so to you. Nothing new in the political way but the raising the Seige of  Savannah, and being unfortunate. You will have perticulars no doubt. Our Friends are all well. Enclosed are some papers and journals. Mr. Lawrance  is appointed to  Holland -- has not yet given his answer.  "
" Janry. 18 1780
","My Dearest Friend It is now a little more than two months since you left me. I have many hopes that you had a prosperous voyage and that you were some weeks ago safely landed in  France. I have been so happy as to hear from you twice upon your passage. Carr arrived safe and carefully deliverd your Letters. You left this coast in the best time that could have been chosen. Winter set in with all its horrors in a week after you  [illegible]  saild, and has continued with all its rigours ever since. Such mountains of snow have not been known for 60 years. No passing for this fortnight, only for foot travellers,  [and] no prospect of any as one Storm succeeds another so soon that the roads are filld before a path can be made. I hope you are in a climate more Friendly to Health and more condusive of pleasure than the unsocial Gloom and chill which presents itself to my view. The  of the roads has been a sad hinderance to the meeting of the convention, a few only of the near Members could get together, so few that they were obliged to adjourn. Many of them mourn the absence of one whom water, not snow seperates from them. They are pleased to say that he was more attended to than any other member, and had more weight and influence upon the minds of the convention. This Town have received an invitation to elect  member in the room of your Excellency, but do not appear to consider the importance of it, since the fear of expence overpowers every other consideration. Indeed their is but one person who could do them any Essential Service were they to elect a member and they might consider his being their representitive as an objection,tho that rule has been broken over in many places. It is a  that so noble a structure should undergo such a mutilation as to make it limp and totter all the rest of its life, yet I fear this will be its fate. Enclosed to you are the journals and News papers which Mr. Lovell has forwarded to me with directions to enclose them to you. Generall Warren has just acquainted me that a packquet will sail for  Spain in a day or two, that Mr. Austin goes in her in a publick character with dispatches for you, and that you may have the opportunity of conveying whatever you please in a State Frigate. You will learn from Mr. Austin the state of our currency and the rate of exchange which renders it needless for me to say any thing upon the subject.  is at present the subject of conversation and admiration. I wish to know the History of this adventurous Hero, his Letter to Lady Selkirk fixed him in my memory. I need not add how much I wish to hear of your safety and happiness, as well as the success of your Embassy. Of the latter I can form no very flattering expectation at   present. Present my  complements to Mr. Dana. The inclement Season has prevented all communication between his good Lady and your Portia, but when ever the Season will permit shall not fail visiting a sister in seperation, and hope by that time to rejoice with her in the assurance of the safety and happiness of our partners.   Believe me dear sir with the tenderest sentiments of regard affectionately yours. "
 Febry. 26 1780,"My dearest Friend This day I am happy in the News of your safe arrival at  Corruna by a vessel arrived at  Newbury port in 60 days from thence. I cannot be sufficiently  for this agreable intelligence, or for the short, and I hope agreable voyage with which you were favourd. I suppose you will proceed from thence by land and flatter myself that a few weeks will bring me the agreable tidings of your arrival in  France. Capt. Sampson has at last arrived after a tedious passage of 89 days. By him came 3 Letters for you, 2 from  and one from Mr. Gellee. Both these Gentlemen are pleasd to make mention of me? You will therefore return my Respectfull complements to them, and tell them that I esteem myself honourd by their notice. I wrote you by Mr. Austin who I hope is safely arrived. He went from here in the height of the  winter I ever saw. In the latter part of December and beginning of Janry. there fell the highest snow known since the year 1740, and from that time to this day the Bay has been froze so hard that people have walked, road, and sleded, over it to  Boston; it was froze across  Nantasket road, so that no vessel could come in or go out; for a month. For 30 days after the storms, we had neither snow, rain, or the least Thaw. It has been remarkably Healthy, and we have lived along tolerably comfortable, tho many people have sufferd greatly for fuel. The winter has been so severe  that very little has been attempted, and less performed by our army. The Enemy have been more active and mischievous; but have fail'd in their Grand attempt of sending large succours to  Gorgia: by a severe storm which dispersed and wrecked many of their Fleet. We have hopes that as the combined Fleets are again at sea, that they will facilitate a Negotiation for peace -- a task arduous and important, beset with many dangers. In one of those Letters Received by Capt. Sampson,  mentions a report which was raised and circulated concerning you, after you left  France. The best reply that could possibly be made to so groundless an accusation, is the unsolicited testimony of your Country, in so speedily returning you there, in a more honorable and important Station, than that which you had before . Pride, vanity, Envy, Ambition and malice, are the  foes that combat merrit and Integrity. Tho for a while they may triumph to the injury of the just and good, the steady, unwearied perseverence of Virtue and Honour will finally prevail over them. He who can retire from a publick Life to a private Station, with a self approveing conscience, unambitious of pomp or power has little to dread from the machinations of envy, the snares of treachery, the Malice of Dissimulation, or the Clandestine stabs of Calumny. In time they will work their own ruin. You will be solicitous to know how our Constitution prospers. Convention are still setting.  I am not at present able to give you an accurate account of their proceedings, but shall endeavour to procure a satisfactory one against a more direct conveyance. I earnestly long to receive from your own hand an assurance of your safety and that of my dear Sons. I send all the journals, and papers I have received. All our Friends are well, and desire to be . Enclosed is a list of Taxes, since December. In April a much larger is to be collected to pay  Penobscot score. Complements to Mr. Dana.  is recoverd from a plurisy which threatned his life, but Mrs. Dana will no doubt write by this conveyance which renders it unnecessary for me to be perticuliar. Success attend all your endeavours for the  weal and  [that] the happiness and approbation of your Country be the Reward of your Labours is the ardent wish of your affectionate  "
March 1 1780,"My Dearest Friend I had  closed my packet to you when I received  your Letters dated  Ferrol  and  Corunna . I am happy indeed in your safe arrival and escape from the danger which threatned you. I feel glad that you have determined to proceed by land  so tedious and expensive a journey. I grow more and more apprehensive of the dangers of the sea, tho I have really no Right to Quarrel with old Neptune, since he has 3 times safely transported my Friend. Tho he has grumbled and growld, he has not shewn the extent of his power. I hope you will meet with so much pleasure and entertainment in your journey, as will be some  for the fatigues of it, and the recital amuse me whenever you can find opportunity to communicate it. The sailors you relieved  at  Corunna passt through this Town, and told their story at Brackets, where a Number of persons collected 40 dollors for them. I wished they had called upon me, I should have been glad to have assisted them. Enclosed are a few journals received yesterday. Am rejoiced to hear my Charles behaves so well, but he always had the faculty of gaining Hearts, and is more  for in this Neighbourhood than I could have believed if I had not heard it. Adieu most affectionately your  Portia    "
April 15 1780,"My dearest Friend By  who is bound to  Amsterdam and from thence to  France, I embrace this opportunity of writing to you; and inquiring after your welfare. Mr. Guile was the Bearer from Mrs. Dana who received them, of the first Letters I received from you. I wish he may be the safe conveyer of mine to you. I have written to you various times since your absence, but have never had one direct conveyance to  France, and I am apprehensive I shall hear but very seldom from you, unless you convey your Letters by way of  Spain and  Holland. Be sure not more than once a year, which is a situation I deprecate. Experience has however taught me more patience,  it has not lessend my anxiety, or my affection. I wish to know your situation, and to hear of your welfare and happiness, I have philosophized so long upon my own that I have brought my mind to a patient acquiescence in it. The social and tender affections have been sacrificed to it, yet the agitation of my mind and spirits, has debilitated my faculties and impaired my Health but I find myself at the same time less attached to the world and the enjoyments of it, whether I am better fitted for an other is a matter I am not resolved in. I have been very fortunate in receiving all your Letters from Spain     . I have traced and followed you upon the Maps through all your peregrinations. It has been a pilgrimage indeed, and the care of the children must have added greatly to your anxiety. I cannot wish to have shared with you as it would have been an additional Burden to you. I have received by Capt. Babson the articles you  for me. Mr. Guardoqui has given in his commissions and Mr. Tracy & Co. the freight, which I esteem very kind in them as I find 15 per cent freight was paid out of articles imported in the same vessel by others. All the articles you were so kind as to send me were very acceptable. The tumblers came safe. They were all of one size. I should have rather had a part in wine Glasses, but nothing comes amiss. The  tho rather coars were an article I stood in great need of, and they are in great demand here. The Tea proves of the best kind, the Hankerchiefs will turn to good account sold for hard Money, the only currency that can be delt in without immense loss. I do not wish to tell you the state of our currency, you may learn it by word of mouth from others. I am about  an article which you directed me to, and for which you gave me Liberty to draw upon you for payment. I shall only do it in part. The remittance lately made me in hankerchiefs only would make the purchase, but as the person would gladly take Bills for the whole, I thought I would give one for a part as the risk would be his, and pay the remainder here. I would not have drawn even for that, but I have some prospect of making a purchase of the House and land, belonging formerly to  who died this winter. I have been trying to agree with the Heir, he asked the moderate price of 20 thousand Dollors when exchange was at 30, it is now 60 and he doubles his demand. There are several persons very eager to purchase it, which has determined the owner to put it up to vendue, if he does shall endeavour to buy it. People here tell me that it was formerly valued at a hundred pounds Lawfull money. It is not so good now as then, yet I should have ventured to have exceeded that price  as it would accommodate this place so well, if I could have done any thing with him, but he was more distracted in his hard money price than in his paper. If he puts it up to vendue, believe that will be the best chance for obtaining it. Mr. C. Tufts has left with me a list of a Number of articles which I enclose, which he wants for his own use, and 7 Louis D'ors, but asked it as a  that I would keep the money and let his risk be but once. I ventured to do it, as I enclose a set of Bills of a much larger amount from which I knew you could deduct the sum if you  [illegible]   pleased. I should be obliged if you will order me 12 Ells of Led coulourd Lutestring and 12 of black and white changeable with half a peice of black ribbon and a peice of Narrow about 4 sols per yard with 3 yards of plain black Gauze and 3 of figured. If you should think proper not to deduct the 7 Louis from the Bills you will please to order the remainder remitted in common Calico and  which are the most saleable articles here. I request at the same time that you  [illegible]   would not straiten yourself for supplies to me, especiall whatever you may esteem a superfluity.  I fear will very soon become a widower. It appears to me and to others that his wife is far gone in a consumption. Your Mother is in tolerable Health tho much broken I think with the Severity of the winter which has been very unfavourable to people in years. The old gentleman is almost helpless. All the rest of our Friends are well.  News you will learn from the papers. Some vessel or other will sail for  France soon by which I shall again write.  The Spring is advanceing fast, which after the rigour of a Canadian Winter is more particuliarly agreable to those who do not feel that Lassitude from it; which anxiety of mind, confinement, and want of exercise produce in your ever affectionate   "
May 1 1780,"My Dearest Friend Last week arrived at  Boston the Marquis de la Fayette to the universal joy of all who know the Merit and Worth of that Nobleman. He was received with the ringing of Bells,  of cannon, bon fires &c. He was so kind as to forward my Letters immediately, but his haste to set of for  Philadelphia deprived me of the  of a visit from him at  Braintree which I had hoped for, and but just gave me the opportunity of writing him a Billet. I am just informed that the General Pickering is to sail from  Salem in a day or two, and that my Letters must be instantly ready. I was in hopes that the new State Frigate  the Protector would have gone, but find it otherways determined. I have written to you by Mr. Guile, who goes first to  Amsterdam. I could have wished that those Letters had gone by this vessel as it is the first direct conveyance I have had since you left me. You will be so good as to notice the dates of Letters which you receive from time to time. I shall then be able to judge what is necessary to repeat if any should be lost. I will however mention again that Capt. Babson arrived and that I received the articles you ordered for me to the amount of 40 pounds sterling. All your Letters have come safe to hand that you have written since you left me, except what may be on Board the Alliance who is not yet arrived by which I hope the tide of fortune is turned in my . I enclose a set of Bills. I have been  in my Letters by Mr. Guile, but as I wish  a return by this vessel, and least he should not arrive I will repeat that I requested you to send me 12 Ells of black and white striped Lutestring or changeable, Mr. Bondfeild sent a peice to Mr. Warren, the same kind I want, would send a pattern, but have none, and 12 Ells of Led coulourd proper for mourning. The first I want for Nabby, the other for myself, as I greatly fear I shall soon have a call for it. Your Brother will soon be a widower we all apprehend, his wife is in the last stages of a consumption, has been confined to her room for more than two months, and in circumstances too, otherways allarming. I added to those a  of black Ribbon common width and a peice of Narrow about 4 or 5 sols per yard, 3 yard of black plain gauze and 6 figured, 2 black fans, 3 black gauze hankerchiefs. I also mentioned that what remained of the Bills you might if you pleased order remitted in common calico low priced hankerchiefs and fans which are articles that turn to the best account here. I have enclosed a list of some articles for Cotton Tufts for which he paid me 7 Louis doers to be deducted from the Bills in lieu of the calico, and other articles provided you find yourself in the least straitned which I fear you will. The remittance from  Bilboa will render me very comfortable for this 12 month, even tho I should purchase the land which belonged to Nate'll Belcher, which I have written to you about. I have drawn one Bill of an hundred dollors in favour of Bomstead for you know what. He used formerly to have 50 pounds for the best Sort, I could not get it so low now, but have paid the rest myself by turning my hankerchiefs (a part of them) to very good account. I would  not have drawn at all; but hoped to make a purchase of the land. Received the present by the Marquis. You desire to know what I want that may be sent in the same manner-a peice or two of Holland Apron tape, a pair of silk mitts or Gloves, an Ell or two of Muslin or figured Lawn, and as a little of what you call frippery is very necessary towards looking like the rest of the world, Nabby would have me add, a few yard of Black or White Gauze, low priced black or white lace or a few yards of Ribbon but would have Mamma write to Pappa at the same time that she has no passion for dress further than he would approve of or to appear when she goes from home a little like those of her own age. But I must add that I do not wish you to send much of any of these articles in this way as I find by compareing the articles you was so kind as to send me, with those put up, both by Mr. Bondfeild, and the other Gentleman, whose Name I cannot undertake to spell, that they turn out much Dearer by retail. The hankerchiefs were exceeding nice, but being Linnen they will not last like the India Silk which are hardly so high priced, and which here will fetch double. Crosby has had his  measured again and makes 6 acres and a quarter. French measured it and has given a plan of it. It will not do to call for an other measure, it will multiply to 7, so I must settle in the best manner I can. I have a Castle in the air which I shall write to you upon by the next opportunity, either for you to laugh at and reject, or to think of if practicable. I wrote to  two months  ago that I feard you would be embarrassed if he did not supply you. I shall as you desire repeat it to him. I have written to my dear sons by Mr. Guile.  too, has written to you. If I have time I shall not fail writing to Mr. Thaxter who is very good to remember me so often. I highly esteem both him and his Letters. I found to him to be all you discribe him, and knew you could not be better suited. I am happy however in finding that my loss is your gain, I really miss his services and attentions. Our Friends are in pretty good health excepting . Your worthy parent is much broken by the severity of the winter -- mine stood the winter well but fails much more than I have known him this spring. So many others will write you the state of  that I believe I shall not touch upon them. I have enclosed  Philadelphia papers and journals. Our currency too is a Subject which you must learn from others; if I can procure sufficient to pay my taxes I shall be content, I want no more. I will just mention that the last years tax upon only two acres and half of Medow in  Milton was 60 dollors and a parish tax for the land you own in the next parish 50 dollors. This year tis impossible to say to what amount they will rise. The tenants are all scared and declare they will quit Farms as tis impossible for them to pay half the taxes. Mine talked in the same strain but finally concluded to tarry an other year. Complements to Mr. Dana and to my correspondent Madam Grand. "
June 13 1780,"My dearest Friend The  which I thought had saild a fortnight ago, still lies at  Newbury Port, and gives me the opportunity of acquainting you with the death of a Sister in Law, who I followed to the grave a week ago, leaving behind a Babe about 5 days old, and a distressd family of children, by which loss your Brother  [illegible]   is bereved of an Excellent wife and his children a most kind and affectionate Mother. I have had one of the little Girls with me, and shall keep her till he can supply his family with better assistance. We are greatly anxious for the fate of  Charlestown, no Fleet arrived, yet no Alliance -- am tired a looking for them. -- Constitution will pass, will be accepted, we shall have a constitution of good goverment soon. -- Mr. L-l  [Lovell] writes me your accompts are pass't. There is a balance in your favour for which the treasurer will draw Bills of exchange. Shall I send them to you, or sell them here for  hard Money which I can easily do? Shall wait your determination when ever receive them. Enclosed is a pattern of which should be glad of 4 yards. -- Friends all well -- impatiently waiting to hear from you. Love to the children. But a moments warning to write this. "
July 5 1780,"My Dearest Friend Your  of April 6th reachd me to day per favour Mr. Williams, and is the only one I have had the pleasure of receiving since the arrival of the Marquiss. I wish you would be so particular in yours as to notice any you may receive from me, for to this day I am at a loss to know whether you have yet received a line. Mrs. D-a  told me that Mr. D-a had mentiond hearing twice from her. I never omitted an opportunity which she improved, if I knew of it, so imagine you must have received some. I wish I had  intelligence to communicate to you, I should certainly write you with more pleasure. Our present situation is very dissagreable, it is Alarming, but perhaps not more so than you have heretofore been witness to; who ever takes a retrospective view of the war in which we are engaged, will find that Providence has so intermixed our  [illegible]   successes, and our defeats, that on the one hand we have not been left to despond, nor on the other, to be unduely elated. We have been taught to sing both of Mercies and of judgements -- and when our Enimies have supposed us subdued, we have  [risen] the conquerors. That  Charlestown is taken is a Truth -- yet it excites not the Rage which our  Road Island or  Penobscot dissapointments did. They stung as Disgraces, this after a Gallant Defence yealded to superiour force, and is considerd as a misfortune, and each one is reanimated with spirit to remedy the Evil. The 3 years Men all disbanded, a large victorious Army in persuit of a small brave, but unfortunate one -- a currency in which there is no Stability or Faith --  are circumstances to puzzel wise Heads and to distress Benevolent Hearts. But as ""affliction is the good mans shining time"" so does  America give proof of her Virtue when distressd. This State have raised, and are procuring their Men with vigor to act in concert with the Fleet and Army of our Generous Ally which we are impatiently looking for. The importance of immediately recruiting our Army is known to be such, that the Demands of pay are exorbitent, yet we fill up at any rate. We pay any price. ""To spare now would be the height of extravagance and to consult present ease would be to sacrifice it perhaps forever,"" says C.S.  [Common Sense].   now see to their sorrow their deplorable mistake in not inlisting their Army during the war. Thousands of Lives might have been saved and a million of treasure. We now only patch and patch, find a temporary relief at an immence expence and by this false step give our Enemies advantages they could never have obtained if we had possessd a Regular Army. Nothing could have been more fortunate for me than the arrival of the few articles you  for me from  Bilboa, just as the time when the calls for large sums of money took place. (The Quarterly tax for the state and continent amounts to 7 hundred pounds Lawfull, my part.) Mr. Tracy kindly forwarded them to me, with this complement, that he wished there had been ten times as much. Enclosed is a Resolve of Congress with regard to your  and a coppy of their Resolve with regard to your accounts. Mr. L-l  [Lovell] wrote me that the Treasurer would draw a Bill for the Balance, which shall enclose as soon as I receive. From  Spain there are ten  opportunities of getting merchandize to one from  France. If you should think proper to make further remittances from Bilboa, be so kind as to send the following list, in lieu of  Barcelona hankerchiefs with which the Market is at present Glutted. Order 15 yards of thin black mode, ditto white, ditto red, ditto blew, some black sattin proper for cloaks and low priced black lace, calico and Irish linnen, which is not higher priced than dutch, but sells much better, the best Hyson tea, the first I had was of the best sort, the last very ordinary. Enclosed is a set of Bills. The other sent by Mr. Guile who I hope is safely arrived, but least he should not I will enclose a list of some things which I wrote for by him and some patterns of silk which I want for mourning for myself and Nabby -- 15 yards of each kind which will be about four Livers per yard. If any thing of the wollen kind could be had which would answer for winter wear, be so kind as to order enough for two win Gowns. 2 or 3 pair of black silk Gloves, if they were not in a former list which you carried. I have forgot. 3 black fans, a peice of black ribbon, half a peice of Narrow, 6 yard of plain black Gauze, 6 figured, four yard of plain Muslin. If I omitted in a former list a pound of white thread, (none to be coarse) we can make that; please to add it now and half a dozen peices of Quality binding different colours, ditto shoe binding. Calico can never come amiss, nothing in greater demand here. With Linnen am well supplied.  Spain the best port to send that from. Some figured Lawn like the pattern enclosed about 2 Livers per yard, 6 or 8 yd --  of Cap wire, a dozen peices. -- The Alliance not yet arrived, a speady passage to her, I want my trunk. No intrigues, no machinations that I hear of. There are some Great Folks here who I believe are sincerely glad that you do not stand in their way which from all Quarters is said would have been the case had you been here. I had rather distant as it is that you abide where you are for the present. The Man who from , fortune and abilities ought to be our Chief is not popular, and tho he will have the votes of the sensible judicious part of the State, he will be more than out Numberd by the Lovers of the tinkleling cymball. What a politician you have made me? If I cannot be a voter upon this occasion, I will be a writer of votes. I can do some thing in that way but fear I shall have the mortification of a defeat. Adieu. How many pages does it take to pay the debt of one? How do my dear sons. Well I hope. Charley, the darling of the  is more deared over than all the rest, he possessd the faculty of fastning every body to him. Thommy sends duty to pappa, respects Mr. T-r  [Thaxter] and Loves his Brothers. I will not add any thing for their Sister, but that She does not write half so often as I urge her to. My paper warns me to close, yet gives me room to add the Signature of your ever affectionate "
Sunday Eve'g. july 16 1780,"My dearest Friend I had just retired to my Chamber and taken up my pen to congratulate you upon the arrival of the Fleet of our Allies at  Newport, when I was  down to receive the most agreable of presents -- Letters from my dearest Friend --  one Bearing date March 28  by Mr. Izard and  one of May 3d , taken out of the post office, but to what port they arrived first I know not. They could not be those by the Fleet, as in these you make mention of Letters which I have not yet received, nor by the Alliance since Mr. Williams sailed 25 days after the Fleet, and she was then in  France. A pitty I think that she should stay there when here we are almost destitute, our Navy has been unfortunate indeed! -- Am sorry to find that only a few lines have reached you from me. I have written by way of  Spain,  Holland and  Sweden, but not one single direct conveyance have I had to  France since you left me. I determine to open a communication by way of Guardoca. I wish you would make use of the same conveyance. This with some others will go Direct to you, by the Mars, Capt. Sampson commander, a state vessel. She will return in the Fall, by her should be glad you would order all the Articles I have written for by Mr. Guile, or any other way. So few opportunities offer that my list will contain more articles than I should otherways mention. What shall I say of our political affairs. Shall I exclaim at measures, now impossible to remedy? No I will hope all from the generous aid of our allies  in concert with our own exertions. I am not suddenly elated or depressed. I know  America capable of any thing she undertakes with spirit and vigour, ""Brave in distress, serene in conquest, drowsy when at rest, is her true characteristick."" [Quotation from Thomas Paine's ""American Crisis, No. IX"", as reprinted in the Continental Journal, 29 June 1780, p. 2, col. 2.]  Yet I deprecate a failure in our present Efforts. The Efforts are great, and we give this Campaign more than half our property to defend the other. He who tarries from the Feild cannot possibly earn sufficient at Home, to reward him who takes it. Yet should Heaven bless our endeavours and Crown this year with the blessings of peace, no exertion will be thought too great, no price of property too dear. My whole Soul is  in the Idea. The Honour of my dearest Friend, the welfare and happiness of this wide extended Country, ages yet unborn, depend for their happiness and security, upon the able and skillfull, the Honest and upright Discharge of the important trust committed to him. It would not become me to write the full flow of my Heart upon this occasion. My constant petition for him is, that he may so discharge the trust reposed in him, as to merrit the approveing Eye of Heaven, and Peace, Liberty and Safety crown his latest years in his own Native Land. The Marchioness at the Abbe Reynald is not the only Lady who joins an  voice to that of her Country, tho at the expence of her present domestick happiness. It is easier to admire virtue, than to practise it, especially the great virtue of self denial. I find but few sympathizing souls. Why should I look for them? since few have any souls but of the sensitive kind.  That nearest Allied to my own they have taken from me, and tell me Honour and Fame are a compensation. But  be my pen. Let me cast my Eye upon the Letters before me. What is the example? I follow it in silence. I have repeated to you in former Letters that I had received all your Letters from  Spain, unless you wrote by Capt. Trash, who brought me some articles, but no Letters. In a former Letter I wrote you an account of the death of Sister A-s  and that she left a poor Babe only 5 days old -- a distressd flock of little ones besides. My Father desires to be rememberd to you, but will I fear never again see you. He declines daily, has a slow fever hanging about him, which wastes his flesh and spirits. These are tender ties, and how far ever advanced in life, the affectionate child feels loth to part with the Guide of youth, the kind adviser of riper years, yet the pillow must Moulder with time and the fabrick fall to the dust. Present my complements to Mr. d-a . Tell him I have calld up his Lady, and we enjoyed an afternoon of sweet communion. I fit she would not be averse to takeing a voyage should he be continued abroad. She groans most bitterly, and is Irreconcilable to his absence. I am a mere philosopher to her. I am inured, but not  hardned to the painfull portion. Shall I live to see it otherways? Your Letters are always valuable  to me, but more particularly so, when they close with an affectionate assurence of regard, which tho I do not doubt, is never repeated without exciteing the tenderest sentiments -- and never omitted without pain to the affectionate Bosom of  "
July 24 1780,"My dearest Love Your affectionate Letter by the Count de Noailles  me but yesterday, together with  your present  by Col. Fleury which was very nice and Good. Should you send any thing of the kind in the same way, be so good as to let it be blew, white or red. Silk Gloves or mittins, black or white lace, Muslin or a Bandano hankerchief, and even a few yard of Ribbon might be conveyed in the same manner. I mention these things as they are small articles, and easily contained in a Letter, all of which by Resolve of congress are orderd to come Free. The Articles you orderd me from  Bilboa are of great service to me. The great plenty of  Barcelona hankerchiefs make them unsaleable at present, but Linnens are an article in great demand, and will exchange for any family necessary to good account, or sell for money, which is in greater demand at present than I have known it since paper was first Emitted. High prices, high taxes, high bounties render such a Quantity of it necessary, that few people can procure sufficient to answer necessary demands. The usual Estimation is a Dollor at a copper, yet exchange at the highest has been at 75 for one. Country produce exceeds foreign articles, Lamb at 10 Dollors per pound, veal at 7, flower  a hundred and 60 pound per hundred, Rye 100 & 10 Dollors per Bushel. I had determined not to have written you the account of prices &c., have avoided it all along, chose you should learn it from inquiry of others but insensibly fell into it. I have a request to you which I hope you will not  me of, a minature of Him I best Love. Indulge me the pleasing melancholy of contemplating a likeness. The attempt here faild, and was more the resemblance of a cloisterd Monk, than the Smileing Image of my Friend. I could not endure the sight of it. -- By Sampson will be a Good opportunity. Should he be taken none but a Savage would rob a Lady, of what could be of no value, but to her. Let him put it into his chest and it will come safe I dare say. Let it be set, it will be better done with you than here. I mentioned sending Bills by this opportunity but as I have already sent 3 sets was advised to defer the others till I knew whether they had faild. If I have not been too extravagant already, I would mention one article more, as I do not expect an other opportunity from  France for a twelve month. It is a Green umbrella. You think you run great risks in taking  our two Sons. What then was  mine? I could have accompanied you through any Dangers and fatigues, but whether I could have sustaind them I know not. An intimation that I could have renderd you more comfortable and happy, would have outweighd all my timidity. I should have had no other consideration. Yet the dangers of the sea, of Enimies and the fatigues of a long journey are not objects that I wish to encounter. A small portion of my own Country will be all I shall ever visit, nor should I carry my wishes further, if they would not seperate what God joined together. Ever remember with tenderness and affection yours & yours only "
August 23 1780,"I could not omit so  an opportunity as the present of writing you a line by Mr. Warren who is upon his travells, and tis not unlikely may take  France in his way. I know the welfare of your family so essential to your happiness, that I would improve every means of  you of it, and of communicating to you the pleasure I have had in receiving every Letter you have written since you first left the harbour of  Boston. Mine to you have not been so successfull. Several packets have been sent to Neptune,  improperly directed, and I Query whether having found his mistake he has had complasance enough to forward them to you. So that you must not charge to me any failure in point of puntuality or attention, but to the avidity of the watery Gods who I really believe have distroyed them -- but enough of romance. You see I am in good Spirits -- I can tell you the cause. The Alliance arrived last week and brought me ""the Feast of Reason and the flow of Soul.""   too, of the Health of my dear absent Friends.  Those only who know by experience what a Seperation is from the tenderest of connextions, can form adequate Ideas of the happiness which even a literary communication affords I have written to you  and to my dear Sons by Capt. Sampson. If Mr. Warren should be the Bearer of this, I need not ask you to love him, his  will ensure him that, and every attention he may stand in need of from one who never suffers the promiseing youth to pass unnoticed by him, more especially one who has a double claim to your Friendship, not only on his own account, but from the long and intimate Friendship which subsists between his worthy parents and the Friend I address -- who will be pleased to accept of the tenderest Sentiments of affectionate from his To his Excellency John Adams   Paris.   "
Sepbr. 3 1780,"My Dearest Friend By a Vessel of my  bound to  Bilboa I write you a few lines, and commit them to the care of our Friends Gardoqui to whom I have written for a few small Articles, and desired them to draw upon you for pay, but the demand will not amount to more than 20 dollors I think.   I have been so unfortunate as to have my Trunk left in  France, and the Alliance arrive safe here without it, to the no small dissapointment of our Friends, yet I know you will be full as much so. You have I know taken as much pains to forward it as you possibly could: to the dissentions on Board the Ship, and to no other cause is the dissapointment oweing. I could wish if it should not be shiped before this reaches you that it may wait, and come in Sampson if he is arrived: if he has, you have the Resolve of Congress which you wrote for and which will render you comfortable, till some other plan can take place. I have not been able to procure the Bills which are due to you from Congress. Shall forward them as soon as I receive them. All your Letters are come safe to hand, as well as the presents you mention, except that by , who waits to come in Jones. I find you can greatly benifit me in this way. The chintz by Mr. Brown was very good and not dear as you Imagined. This Gentleman spent a day with me, I was much pleased with his modesty and affability.  did me the Honour of keeping the Sabbeth with me. I expect an other visit from him when he returns from  Plimouth where he is now gone. This is a Great and important day in the political System of this State.  has merrit and integrity, all the judicious people will vote for him, but popular Clamour will elect an other, who ought to forfeit every vote, by the low mean Arts he has taken to procure them. I could tell you many, if prudence did not restrain me, yet nothing that would surprize you, for you know every Avenu of his vain Heart. Give an extensive cord, and you know the adage. We have a Melancholy prospect about us. The most severe drought known for many years, has cut of our grass, our corn and our Gardens. Yesterday we had a  rain, and the first since the begining of May. Many person have been obliged to give Hay to their cattle for more than a month --  but in the midst of this calimity we have a general time of Health. No News . General Washington has the best Army that he has had since the commencment of the war, yet tis like to be a very inactive campaign. The arrival of Graves fleet so soon after that of our Allies, put a stop to every measure which had been concerted for the Benifit of these States and at an amazeing expence we are keeping a defensive army. Tis true our Enemies have done nothing since the  of  Charlestown, but we ought to have balanced accounts with them. I shall not write to my dear Sons now on account of the postage. You will remember me to them, and let Mr. D-a  [Dana] know that his family are well, Mr. T-r  [Thaxter] too. I wrote you in May  , an account of the death of sister A-s  [Adams]. If this vessel should not sail immediately will enclose a list of our Great folks. [Meaning those who were to be elected next day as governor, lieutenant governor, and members of the Council and Senate.]  I know you will be earnest to hear. -- Pray write to me by every opportunity. I shall omit none to you. Your Letters are the cordials which keep my Spirits alive. Ever believe me with the tenderest sentiments of affection and Regard your PS  thinks you neglect him that you did not write him by the Alliance -- says he wont write again.    "
October 8 1780,"My Dearest Friend My  who is very attentive to acquaint me with every opportunity of conveyance, last Evening let me know of a vessel going to  Spain, and tho my Letters cost you much more than they are worth; I am bound as well by inclination, as your repeated injunctions to omit no opportunity of writeing. My last to you was by way of  Bilboa. A vessel will soon sail for  Amsterdam, by which I shall write largely to you, to my dear Boys, and to my  correspondent. I am not without some prospect that the Letters may find you at that very port. I not long ago  that a commission for  Holland was forwarded to you. I was much  to find that you had not heard from C-ss  [Congress] by the date of  your last, the 17 of June . The communication from that Quarter is worse than it is from here, bad enough from both, for an anxious wife and an affectionate Mother. I know not how to enter into a detail of our  affairs -- they are not what I wish them to be. The successes of the Enemy at  Charlestown are mortifying. General Gates misfortune will be anounced to you before this reaches you, and the enclosed Gazet will give you all the information of the treachery of Arnold which has yet come to hand. How ineffectual is the  of Honour to bind the Humane Mind, unless accompanied by more permanent and Efficacious principals? Will he who laughs at a future state of Retribution, and holds himself accountable only to his fellow Mortals disdain the venal Bribe, or spurn the Ignoble hand that proffers it. Yet such is the unhappy lot of our native land, too, too many of our chief Actors have been and are unprincipled wretches, or we could not have  as we have done. It is Righteousness, not Iniquity, that exalteth a Nation. There are so many and so loud complaints against some persons in office that I am apt to think neither age nor Fame will screen them.  All hopes that I had entertained of a vigorous campaign, have been obstructed by a superiour British naval force, and the daily Rumours of a reinforcement from  France, rise and vanish with the day. The season is now so far advanced, that little or no benifit would accrue from their arrival, yet with all the force of Graves and Rodny nothing has yet been attempted, they content themselves with the conquests of Clinton, and give out that the  Northern States are not worth, possessing. Peace, Peace my beloved object is farther and farther from my Embraces I fear, yet I have never asked you a Question which from the Nature of your Embassy I knew you could not determine. It is however an object so near my Heart, that it lies down and rises with me. Yet could you bring the olive Branch, even at the expiration of an other year, my present sacrifices should be my future triumph, and I would then try if the , as I am sometimes told, could then compensate for the substantial Blessings I resign. But my dear Friend well knows that the Honour does not consist so much in the Trust reposed, as in the able, the Honest, the upright and faithfull discharge of it. From these sources I can derive a pleasure, which neither accumulated Honours, wealth, or power, could bestow without them. But whether does my pen lead me? I meant only to write you a short Letter, if writing to you I could do so. Some months ago I wrote you an account of the death of  and of her leaving a poor Babe, only 3 days old. The death of Mr. H-l  [Hall], who full of years, was last week gatherd to the great congregation, will be no matter of surprize to you. Your M-r  [Mother] is gone to your B-r  [Brother], till a change in his condition may render her services unnecessary, which with a young family of 5 children, is not likely to be very soon. Whatever she call upon me for shall endeavour to supply her with.  She would have been more comfortable with me, but her compassion lead her to him. She desires me to remember, ever her tenderest affection to you. I always make her a sharer with me in whatever I receive from you, but some small present from your own Hand to her, would I know be particularly gratefull to her, half a dozen yards of dark chints, if you are at a loss to know what, or any thing -- it is not the value but the notice which would be pleasing. Excuse my mentioning it, I know you burdend with matters of more importance, yet these attentions are the more gratefull on that very account. Pray make my  complements to Mr. D-a  [Dana] and tell him that his Lady made me a Friendly visit last week, and we talked as much as we pleased of our dear Absents, compared Notes, Sympathized, Responded to each other, and mingled with our sacrifices some little pride that no Country could boast two worthyer Hearts than we had permitted to go abroad -- and then they were such honest souls too, and so intirely satisfied with their  American dames, that we had not an apprehension of their roveing. We mean not however to defy the Charmes of the   Parissian Ladies, but to admire the constancy and fidelity with which they are resisted -- but enough of Romance. Be so good as to let Mr. T-r  know that his Friends are all well, and will write by the  Amsterdam vessel. This will be so expensive a conveyance that I send only a single Letter. I have been very sick for a month past with a slow fever, but hope it is leaving me. For many years I have not escaped a sickness in the Fall. -- I hope you enjoy Health, Dr. L-e  says you grow very fat. My poor unfortunate trunk has not yet reachd  America, that was  forced to share the Fate of party and caballs, was detaind by Dr. W-p  [Windship]. I wish it in other Hands, do not let it go for  Philadelphia if you can prevent it. Mr. L-l  [Lovell] has sent me a set of Bills, which I enclose, but is much short of the balance reported in your favour. I take the remainder to be included with the other gentlemens accounts. After having stated the balance they say thus -- ""we beg leave to remark, that the examination of the coppy of an account marked A, which they received with Mr. A's other accounts and is for joint expences of himself Doctr. F-n  [Franklin] and Mr. D-e  [Deane], cannot be gone into at present, the monies credited therein having been received, and the vouchers to said account remaining with them.""  is in  B-n  [Boston] but would send her duty and Love by all opportunities tho I cannot prevail with her to write so often as I wish. Little Tom sends his Duty, learns fast now he has got a school master. My tenderest regard to my two dear Sons. The account of their good conduct is a  Balm to the Heart of their & your ever affectionate  PS  Friends are all well. You will hear a strange story about the Alliance -- the officers of the Ship ran away with her to  Boston. Barre has got the command of her now. Pray write me by way of  Bilboa.  Holland is a fine place for Buisness -- there is much trade from here there, many vessels go and come from thence, as well as to  Spain. I am quite impatient to hear from you again, 4 months since the last date.  "
October 15 1780,"My Dearest Friend I closed a long Letter to you only two days ago and sent it to  , but as no opportunity is omitted by me, I embrace this, as Col. Flury was kind enough to write me on purpose from  Newport to inform me of it, and to promise a carefull attention to it. Yet I feel doubtfull of its safety, the Enemy seem to be collecting a prodigious force into these seas, and are bent upon the destruction of our Allies. We are not a little anxious for them, and cannot but wonder that they are not yet reinforced. Graves Fleet, Arbuthnots and Rodneys, all here. With such a superiority, can it be matter of surprize, if Mr. de Ternay should fall a sacrifice? My own Mind I own is full of apprehension, yet I trust we shall not be deliverd over to the vengance of a Nation more wicked and perverse than our own. We daily experience the correcting and the defending Arm. The enclosed paper will give you the particulars of an infernal plot, and the providential discovery of it -- for however the Belief of a particular Providence may be exploded by the Modern Wits, and the Infidelity of too many of the rising generation deride the Idea, yet the virtuous Mind will look up and acknowledge the great first cause, without whose notice not even a sparrow falls to the ground. I am anxious to hear from you.  Your last Letter  which I have received was dated in June the 17. I have wrote you repeatedly that my Trunk was not put on Board the Alliance. That poor vessel was the sport of more than winds and waves, the conduct with regard to her is  as very extrodanary. She came to  Boston as you have no doubt heard. Landay is suspended -- the Man must be new made before he can be entitled to command. I hope Capt. Sampson arrived safe, he carried the resolve of Congress which you wanted. As to our  affairs Mr. H-l  [Hall] is dead, and your M-r  [Mother] went to your B-r  [Brother] he having lost his wife in the Spring, and was there taken Ill. I sent for her home, and have nursed the old Lady through a severe turn of a fever in which I feard for her life. She is however upon the recovery and desires her tenderest regards to you, tho she fears she shall not live to see your return. I am myself just recovering from a slow fever, weak and feeble yet. If you have an opportunity by way of  Holland by Mr. Austin to send me some paint and oil, stone coulour, I wish you would. You tell me to send you price current. I will aim at it. Corn is now 30 pound, Rye 27 per Bushel, flower  from a hundred and 40 to a hundred and 30 per hundred, Beaf 8 dollors per pound, Mutton 9, Lamb 6, 7 and 8, Butter 12 dollors per pound, cheese 10, Sheeps Wool 30 dollors per pound, flax 20.  West India articles Sugar from a hundred and 70 to 2 hundred pounds per hundred, Molasses 48 dollors per Gal., Tea 90, Coffe 12, cotton Wool 30 per pound. Exchange from 70 up to 75 for hard Money. Bills at 50 -- Money scarce, plenty of Goods, enormous Taxes. -- Our State affairs are thus. H-k  [Hancock] will be Governour by a very great Majority -- the Senate will have to choose the Leiut. Governour -- our constitution is read with great admiration in  New York and pronounced by the royall Governour to be the best Republican form he ever saw, but with sincere hopes that it might not be accepted. How will it be administered is now the important Question? I request you would write to me by the way of  Bilboa and  Holland. I have sent you a set of Bill for 4 hundred . I have one more for a hundred which I have not yet enclosed. I did not know but I had best send it to  Holland or  Bilboa, but am not determined. Enclose a Letter for Mr. T-r  [Thaxter]. Shall write again to  Amsterdam a vessel will soon sail. Let Mr. D-a  [Dana] know that I heard last Night from Mrs. D-a that she, the judge and family were all well. -- The Report of the day is that 3 thousand troops are arrived at  New York from  England.  "
October 18 1780,"My Dearest Friend The vessel by which I mean to send this is bound for  Amsterdam and had very nigh given me the slip. I have been writing to you when ever I was able by other opportunities, and should have  several Letters for this conveyance, but I have been very sick with a slow fever, and your Mother has been sick here of a fever, occasiond by great fatigue, the old gentleman dyeing about 3 weeks ago of a fever. Both of us are much better. I have got out, tho she has not yet left her chamber. The rest of our Friends are well. I wish this Letter might find you in  Holland. I think it not improbable if you have received a Commission forwarded to you some months ago. My Trunk about which you have been so anxious, and so often wished me safe, is not on board the Alliance to my no small mortification. You have found out the cause I dare say before this time. Party and cabal ran so high that the person to whose care it was intrusted, did not  to come in the ship -- so that it may possibly lay in  France till Sampson arrives. If it should I wish it may be put on Board of him and be so good as to get an invoice of Mr. Moylan and send the first opportunity. This I wish you to do. If it should come by the Dr., it will be no damage to compare them. Holland is so much improved in the way of Trade, that ten nay twenty opportunities offer for sending from there, to one from  France. Enclosed I send a set of Bills received from Mr. L-l . They do not amount to near the Balance reported in your favour, but I suppose the rest to be connected with the other Gentlemens accounts, which they say can not be gone into at present for want of a state of theirs. I have however written to Mr. L-l to know if it is really so. As to  if I begin I shall not know where to end, yet I must tell you of a horrid plot, just ready to have been sprung, which would have given us a shock indeed. Arnold, you know him unprincipald as the . He missirable wretch had concerted a plan to give up  West point where he commanded with its dependancies, into the hands of the Enemy. He had made returns of every important matter to them; with a plan (but a little before concerted, between the General officers) and State of the Army. Major Andry was the person upon whom these papers were found. An officer in the British Army, sensible, bold and enterprizing, universally beloved by them, and regreated with many tears -- he was young and very accomplished, but taken in our Camp as a Spy, he was tried, condemned and Executed. Arnold upon the first allarm that Andry was taken, conveyd himself on Board a ship of war and deserted to the Enemy. I have by two late papers sent you enclosed to you the whole of this Black transaction, so providentially discoverd which must excite gratitude in every Breast not wholy devoid of principal. -- It is now a long time since I  heard from you,  the 17 of June  was the last date. I have just sent Letters for Mr. T-r  to  Newport to go in a French Frigate. I shall write to him by a vessel soon to sail for  France and to my dear Boys. Remember me tenderly to them. Ah! when shall I see them again, or their dear parent? -- I must bid you good Night, tis late and I am yet feable and weak. Believe me with sentiments of tenderness & affection   "
November 13th 1780,"My dearest Friend How long is the space since I heard from my dear absent Friends? Most feelingly do I experience that sentiment of Rousseaus  ""that one of the greatest evils of absence, and the only one which reason cannot alleviate, is the inquietude we are under concerning the actual state of those we love, their health, their life, their repose, their affections. Nothing escapes the apprehension of those who have every thing to lose."" Nor are we more certain of the present condition than of the future. How tormenting is absence! How fatally capricious is that Situation in which we can only enjoy the past Moment, for the present is not yet arrived. Stern Winter is making hasty Strides towards me, and chills the warm fountain of my Blood by the Gloomy prospect of passing it alone, for what is the rest of the World to me? ""Its pomp, its pleasures and its  all?"" The fond endearments of social and domestick life, is the happiness I sigh for, of that I am in a great measure deprived by a seperation from my dear partner and children, at the only season in life when it is probable we might have enjoyed them all together. In a year or two, the sons will be so far advanced in life, as to make it necessary for their Benifit, to place them at the Seats of Learning and Science, indeed the period has already arrived, and whilst I still fondle over one, it is no small relief to my anxious mind, that those, who are seperated from me, are under your care and inspection. They have arrived at an age, when a Mothers care becomes less necessary and a Fathers more important. I long to embrace them. The Tears my dear Charles shed at parting, have melted my Heart a thousand times. Why does the mind Love to turn to those painfull scenes and to recollect them with pleasure? I last week only received  a Letter written last March , and sent by   John Baptiste Petry. Where he is I know not. After nameing a Number of persons of whom I might apply for conveyance of Letters, you were pleased to add, they were your great delight when they did not censure, or complain, when they did they were your greatest punishment. I am  unconscious of giving you pain in this way since your late absence. If any thing of the kind formerly escaped my pen, had I not ample  retaliation, and did we not Balance accounts tho the sum was rather in your favour even after having distroyed some of the proof. In the most Intimate of Friendships, there must not be any recrimination. If I complaind, it was from the ardour of affection which could not endure the least apprehension of neglect, and you who was conscious that I had no cause would not endure the supposition. We however wanted no mediating power to adjust the difference, we no sooner understood each other properly, but as the poet says,  ""The falling out of Lovers is the renewal of Love."" and you are sure of a Heart all your own, which no other Earthly object ever  Sure I am that not a syllable of complaint has ever stained my paper, in any Letter I have ever written since you left me. I should have been ungratefull indeed, when I have not had the shadow of a cause; but on the contrary, continual proofs of your attention to me. You well know I never doubted your Honour. Virtue and principal confirm the indissoluable Bond which affection first began and my security depends not upon your passion, which other objects might more easily excite, but upon the sober and setled dictates of Religion and Honour. It is these that cement, at the same time that they ensure the affections. I had written thus far when Capt. Davis arrived. The News of your being in  Amsterdam soon  me, but judge of my dissapointment when I learnt that he had thrown over all his Letters, being chased by an American privateer, who foolishly kept up British coulours till she came along side of him. One only was saved by some accident and reachd me after hearing that the whole were lost. This tho short was a cordial to my Heart, not having received a line of a later date than  15 [i.e. 17] of June . This was  the fourth of Sepbr. , and just informd me of your Health and that you had been in  Amsterdam a few weeks. My dear sons were not mentiond, and it was only by a very polite Letter from Mr. de Neufville that I learnt they were with you, and well. He is pleased to speak in high terms of them, I hope they deserve it. A week after a Brig arrived at  Providence and brought me  your  of Sepbr. 15  and Mr. Thaxters of August and Sepbr. from  Paris. You do not mention in either of your Letters which were saved, how long you expect to reside in  Holland  I fancy longer than you then Imagined, as Capt. Davis informs that you had not heard of the Capture of Mr. Lawrence. This event will make your stay there necessary. I fear for your Health in a Country so damp, abounding in stagnant water, the air of which is said to be very unfriendly to Foreigners. Otherways if I was to consult my own feelings I should wish your continuance there, as I could hear more frequently from you. If it is not really nearer, its being a sea port, gives me that Idea, and I fancy the pains of absence increase in proportion to distance, as the power of attraction encreases as the distance diminishes. Magnets are said to have the same motion tho in different places. Why may  [illegible]   not we have the same sensations tho the wide  Atlantick roll between us? I recollect your story to Madam Le Texel upon the Nature and power of Attraction and think it much more probable to unite Souls than Bodies. You write me in  yours of  15  that you sent my things in the Alliance. This I was sorry to see, as I hoped Mr. Moylan had informd you before that time, that Dr. Winship to whom he deliverd them neither came in the vessel or sent the things. I am not without fears that they will be embezzled. I have taken every opportunity to let you know of it, but whether you have got my Letters is uncertain. The cabals on Board the Ship threw the officers into parties, and Winship chose to involve my trunk in them. He certainly sent goods by the same vessel to other persons. General W-n  [Warren], my unkle and others examined and went on Board, but could find no Trunk for me. The Articles sent by private hands I believe I have got, except you sent more than one packet by Col. Flury who arrived at  Newport  [and] sent forward a package containing a few yards of Black Silk. A month afterwards, received a Letter from him desireing to know if I received two packages and some Letters which he brought. I received no Letter, and but one package by him. I have been endeavouring to find out the mistery, but have not yet develloped it. -- The Articles you sent me from  Bilboa have been of vast service to me, and greatly assisted me in dischargeing the load of Taxes which it would have otherways been impossible for me to have paid; I will enclose you a list of what I have paid, and yet remains due from july to this day. The Season has been so unfortunate in this state, that our produce is greatly diminished. There never was known so severe and so long a drought, the crops of corn and grass were cut of. Each Town in this State is called  upon to furnish a suffering Army with provision. This Towns supply is 40 thousand weight of Beaf or money to purchase it. This has already been collected. Our next tax is for Grain to pay our six months and our 3 Months militia, to whom we wisely voted half a Bushel per day, the state pay, and a Bounty of a Thousand dollors each or money Equivalent to purchase the Grain. This is now collecting and our Town tax only is four times larger than our continential. You hear no such sound now, as that money is good for nothing. Hard money from 70 to 75 is made the standard, that or exchange is the way of dealing, everything is high, but more steady than for two years before. My Tenants say they must leave the Farm, that they cannot live. I am sure I cannot pay more than my proportion yet I am loth they should quit. They say two Cows would formerly pay the taxes upon this place, and that it would now take ten. They are not alone in their complaints. The burden is greater I fear than the people will bear -- and whilst the  New England states are crushed by this weight, others are lagging behind, without any exertions, which has produced a convention from the  New England States. A motion has been made, but which I sincerely hope will not be adopted by our Goverment, I mean to vest General Washington with the power of marching his Army into the state that refuses supplies and exacting it by Martial Law. Is not this a most dangerous step, fraught with Evils of many kinds. I tremble at the Idea. I hope Congress will never adopt such a measure, tho our delegates should receive such Instructions."" Our  affair wear a more pleasing aspect, as you will see by the inclosed Gazet yet are we very far from extirpating the British force. If we are not to look for peace till that event takes place, I fear it is very far distant. Small as our Navy is, it has captured near all the  Quebeck Fleet, 19 have arrived safe in port, and fill'd  Salem and  Cape Ann with Goods of all kinds. Besides not a week passes but gives us a prize from some Quarter. As to the affairs of our common wealth, you will see . Two good Men have been chosen as Leiut. Governour, both of whom have refused. The late judge of probate is now Elected, and tis thought will accept."" Last week his Excellency gave a very Grand Ball, to introduce our Republican form of Goverment properly upon the Stage.""  It was a maxim of Edward king of  Portugal, that what ever was amiss in the manners of a people, either proceeds from the bad example of the Great, or may be cured by the Good. He is the patriot who when his Country is overwhelmed by Luxery, by his example stems the Torrent and delivers it from that which threatens its ruin. A writer observes with Regard to the Romans, that there must have been a considerable falling off, when Sylla won that popular favour by a shew of Lions, which in better times he could only have obtained by substantial services. I have twice before enclosed a set of Bills, received from Mr. Lovell for you. I ventured to detain one  for an opportunity to send to  Holland. I enclose it now together with a list of the Articles if you think you can afford them to me. If not I shall be better satisfied in a refusal than in a compliance. The Articles you were so kind as to send me were not all to my mind. The Led coulourd Silk was clay coulour, not proper for the use I wanted it for, it was good however. A large Quantity of ordinary black ribbon, which may possibly sell for double what it cost, if it had been coulourd there would have been coulourd there there would have been no difficulty with it. The tape is of the coarsest kind, I shall not lose by it, but as I wanted it for family use, it was not the thing. The Tea was Excellent, the very best I ever had and not so high priced as from other places. All the rest of the articles were agreable. -- I have written to Mr. de Neufville encloseing a duplicate Bill, and a list of the same articles, but directed him to take your orders and govern himself by them. When ever you send me any thing for sale, Linnens especially Irish, are always saleable. Common calico, that comes cheep from  Holland, any thing of the wollen kind such as Tamies, Durants or caliminco with ordinary linnen hankerchiefs answer well. I have written a very long letter. To what port it will go first  know not; it is too late for any vessel to go to  Holland this winter from hence. -- Our Friends all well. Your Brother has lost his youngest daughter. I will write to my dear John and Charles and hope they will  [my?] Letters will not meet the fate of theirs.  NB an Ell in  Holland is but 3 quarters of our yard. You will be so good as to find out where that young gentleman is and forward the Letter.  "
December 25 1780,"My Dearest Friend How much is comprised in that short ? How fondly can I call you mine, bound by every tie, which consecrates the most inviolable Friendship, yet seperated by a cruel destiny, I feel the pangs of absence sometimes too sensibly for my own repose. There are times when the heart is peculiarly awake to tender impressions, when philosophy slumbers, or is  by sentiments more conformable to Nature. It is then that I feel myself alone in the wide world, without any one to tenderly care for me, or lend me an assisting hand through the difficulties that surround me, yet my cooler reason dissaproofs the repineing thought, and bids me bless the hand from whence my comforts flow. More  by Nature, he can scarcly realize all those ties which bind our sex to his. Is it not natural to suppose that as our dependance is greater, our attachment is stronger? -- I find in my own breast a sympathetic power always operating upon the near approach of Letters from my dear absent Friend. I cannot determine the exact distance when this secret charm begins to operate. The time is some times longer and sometimes shorter, the Busy Sylphs are ever at my ear, no sooner does Morpheus close my Eyes, than ""my whole Soul, unbounded flies to thee.""  Am I superstitious enough for a good Catholick? A Mr. Ross arrived lately at  Philadelphia and punctually  your Letter's. At the same time a vessel arrived from  Holland, and brought me  yours from  Amsterdam of the 25 of Sepbr.  which Mr. Lovell was kind enough to forward to me. I have written you largely since Davis arrived here, tho not in reply to Letters brought by him, for old Neptune alone had the handling of them. He was chased and foolishly threw over all his Letters into the sea, to my no small mortification. A Brig which came out with him arrived at  Providence and brought me  yours of Sepbr. 15th , together with some for from Mr. Thaxter. -- The things you sent came safe to hand. Jones not yet arrived. I suppose he may have the much wanted trunk on Board, which you suppose came in the Alliance. You call upon me to write, by every opportunity. I do not omit any, yet my Letters many of them must take so circuitous a Route, that they must cost you much more than they are worth. This I hope will go direct to  France by Col. Pallfry, if he does not sail before it reaches  Philadelphia. -- The Enemy have met with many disastrous events in  Charlestown. As much as they Boast, they have more occasion to mourn. We have had several successes there which do honour to American Arms. If the people can  through the demands this year made upon them,  and accomplish what they are striving after, the filling their Army for 3 years or the War, they will do great things towards a negotiation for peace. The present demand for supplies for the Army, the payment of our 3 and 6 months Men, together with our continential taxes, and govermental expences, oblige every person to look about them and to retrench every Luxery and economize with the utmost frugality. The remittances you have been so kind as to make me, have enabled me hitherto to answer all demands made upon me. I have still much more to pay before the close of the year. I have been trying to collect a list of the Taxes for the present year but have not yet been able. My Tenants groan and say they cannot live, that the whole stock of the place would not pay the yearly tax. Every body groans, yet every body sees the necessity of complying with the requisition. We have in this Town allready collected money to purchase 22 thousand weight of Beaf. We had just accomplished it when out comes an other tax for 46 thousand weight more to be paid by the first of Jan'ry. We have just paid our 3 months men, and our six are returning with loud calls upon us, 46 men are calld to fill our continental Army for 3 years or the war, which are to be procured at any rate. Can you judge of our present Burden? I hope we shall surmount 
Page 4
 all and yet see happy and peacefull days. I told you in a former letter that our Season was  by a most distressing drought, yet the year is crowned with universal Health. We have reason to sing of Mercy and judgment. Admiral de Ternay died last week with a Fever at  Road Island. Our Friends are all well, so is your ever affectionate  Portia Complements to Mr. Dana. Love to my dear  and Charles. I mourn the loss of their Letters by Davis.  My Dear Si    Brother has received a Letter from him dated in  Amsterdam in August, in which he tells him that he had sent a Number of hankerchifs, some for Mr. Bracket and some for Mr. Bass and a Letter with them directing him what to do with the remainder, but is so stupid as not to say, by whom he sent them nor from whence, neither the vessels Name nor captains -- they are not come to hand. The owners come to me to inquire. I cannot give them the least direction, know not a word about them. In future if he does Buisness, he had better be more correct -- he must write to them about them. "
Janry. 15 1781,"My dearest Friend Capt. Caznew is now just about to sail. I wrote large packets to go by him a month ago, but hearing Capt. Trash was going from  Newbury to  Bilboa I sent them by him. It was thought that Caznew would not sail till . But all of a  I am calld upon unprepaird having but an hours warning -- he shall not however go without a line or two.  Your last  which I have received was by way of  Philadelphia dated in Sepbr. 15. I see by last weeks paper that a Capt. Updike is arrived at  Providence. I fear he has no Letters for me, as he brings word that the Fame  the day before him, but has not yet been heard of. We are Fearfull that she is lost, or taken. -- I have written to you twice since Davis arrived, and told you that he threw over all his dispatches, being chased, to my great sorrow and mortification. The things however which you were so kind as to order for me, came safe to hand. I shall be obliged for ought I know to part with them, to pay taxes, which are beyond account. 20 thousand dollors are already assessed upon this place for the last year. I have written to the House of de Neufville for a few articles, which I wrote to you about by way of  Bilboa. I have  them a Bill, and at the same time directed them to take your orders with regard to them. Neither Jones or Sampson have yet   America. We have had a moderate winter and a general Health throughout the State. We are making every Effort to fill up the continential Army, and hope to succeed. Our paper Credit has kept a steady value for more than 3 months.  75 for one is the rate of exchange. Our hard Money tax is punctually paid for the redemption of it. I cannot say that the Money appreciates yet, but it certainly must from the great taxes which are daily collecting. We now see where our errors lay, but a people must feel to be convinced. I enclose to you a Letter and resolve of Congress forwarded to me by Mr. L-l . It contains an approbation of more value to you, than a Lucrative reward and it communicates pleasure to me, in proportion as it is valuable to you, and as it is a testimony, that your assiduity and attention to the publick Interest is gratefully noticed by your Country. To Merrit and receive them it, is the only compensation I can receive for the loss I sustain of your society. The Letter containing remarks upon Lord Gorge Germains , was first published in  Philadelphia and sent me by Mr. L-l. I had it republished here -- it is much approved of. The Enemy lose ground every day in  Carolina. The infamous Arnold is gone with a Number of Troops to  Virgina -- he was too knowing to come out, as was first talkd of against  New england who to a Man would have risen to have crushd the monster. Whilst Andry has been lamented by a Generous Enemy Arnold has been execrated by all ranks. My Love to my dear Sons, there Letters by Davis I mourn the loss of. I  to have written to them by this vessel but fear I shall not have time. I wrote by Trash to Mr. Thaxter. Our Friends are all well -- excuse haste, from your ever affectionate   "
Janry. 21 1781,"My dearest Friend The vessel is not yet gone, and I find I have a towns man going in her. He came this evening to let me know it, and to take Letters from me. What has taken place in the last week Mr. C-h  has informd you of, so that I shall not write politicks. I inclose a paper or two, and a journal or two of congress. In one of the papers you will see an Excellent Letter from a Friend of yours, and a coment comment by an other who sent it to a Gentleman requesting his care of the publication and with his usual complasance, he has published all, together. [AA was sending JA a copy of Willis' (Boston) Independent Chronicle for 18 Jan., containing Mercy Warren's letter to her son denouncing the immoral teachings of Lord Chesterfield's letters to his natural son.]  Many of your Friends will write you by this vessel. I hope it will not be long before some one will arrive with Letters from you. I feel impatient. The  hankerchiefs you was so kind as to send me, are as good an article as has ever come. I can scarcly keep one of them. Tho they are double the price of a Barcelona, they sell much better.  Holland is a good place for crockery ware, I should be glad of some for family use from thence. -- I wish you to write by every vessel bound to  America. Updike arrived at  Providence, but we fear the Fame is lost or taken. Friends all well. .   "
Janry. 28 1781,"My dearest Friend Last Evening General Lincoln  here introducing to me a Gentleman by the Name of Col. Laurence the Son as I suppose, of your much esteemed Friend, the late president of congress who informed me that he expected to sail for  France in a few days, and would take dispatches from me. Altho I closed Letters to you by way of  Holland a few days ago, I would not omit so good an opportunity as the present. Tis a long time since the date of  your Last Letters, the 25 of Sepbr . I wait with much anxiety, listning to the sound of every Gun, but none anounce the arrival of the Fame from  Holland, which we greatly fear is lost, or taken, nor the Mars from  France. I wish you had been fortunate enough to have sent Letters by Updike to  Providence, who saild the day after the Fame, but suppose you wrote by her, and sailing so near together, did not think it worth your while to write by him. Col. Laurence is enabled I suppose to give you, every kind of intelligence respecting the Army which you may wish to learn. Mr. Cranch has written you upon the same Subject by way of  Holland. Your Friends here complain that you do not write to them. I suppose Davis threw over half a hundred Letters. If you are unfortunate in that way tis not to be helped. I have the pleasure to inform you that a repeal of the obnoxious Tender act has past the House and Senate. The G-r  as has been heretofore predicted, when any thing not quite popular is in agitation, has the Gout and is confined to his Bed. A false weight and a false  are an abomination, and in that light this tender act must be viewed by every impartial person. Who but an Ideot would believe that 40 was equal to 75. But the repeal gives us reason to hope that justice and righteousness will again exalt our Nation, that publick Faith will be restored, that individuals will lend to the publick, and that the heavy taxes which now distress all orders, will be lessned. A late  who have been setting upon ways and means for raising money, tell us that a tax for two years more equal to what we have paid in the last would clear this State of debt. You may judge of the weight of them, yet our State taxes are but as a Grain of Mustard Seed, when compared with our Town taxes. Clinton I hear, has sent out a proclamation  upon Germains plan, inviting the people to make a seperate peace, which will only be a new proof of the Ignorance and folly of our Enemies without making a single prosilite -- even the revolted  Pensilvany Troops gave up to justice the Spys which Clinton sent to them, offering them, cloathing and pay, letting them him know that it was justice from their State, not favours from their Enemies that they wanted. It is reported that Arnold with a Body of troops is gone to  Virginia, where it is hoped he and his Myrmidons will meet their fate. Had Clinton been a generous Enemy, or   known humane Nature, he would like Aurelian upon a like occasion, have given up the  [illegible]   traitor to the hands of justice, knowing that it was in vain to expect fidelity in a man who had betrayed his own Country, which from his defection may learn to place a higher value upon integrity, and virtue, than upon a savage ferocity so often mistaken for courage. He who as an individual is cruel, unjust and immoral, will not be likely to possess those virtues necessary in a General or Statesman. Yet in our Infant Country, Infidelity and debauchery are so fashionably prevalent that less attention is paid to the characters of those who fill important offices, than a Love of virtue, and zeal for publick Liberty, can warrant, which we are told by wise Legislators of old, are the surest preservatives of publick happiness. You observe in  a late Letter  that your absence from your Native State will deprive you of an opportunity of being a man of importance in it. I hope you are doing your country more extensive Service abroad than you could have done, had you been confined to one State only, and whilst you continue in the same Estimation   amongst your fellow citizens, which you now hold, you will not fail of being of importance to them: at home or abroad. Heaven preserve the life and Health of my dear absent Friend and in its own time return him to his country, and to the Arms of his ever affectionate PS Love to my Dear Boys. I have sent you a present by Col. Laurence.   "
March 19 1781,"My dearest Friend It was only an hour ago that I was  of a vessel just ready to sail for  Amsterdam; by forgetfullness in the Messenger I have so short warning as to be able to write you only a few lines, yet a few is more than have come to my hand for six months, in all which space only a few lines written last May have reachd me. The Mars arrived the beginning of this Month after a very long passage, but brought me only Letters from Mr. Thaxter written before he left  Paris. By a Letter from Mr. Dana to his Lady I find you were all well in November, yet wonder I should not hear so from your own hand. Jones too has arrived at  Phili-pia but brought no Letters for me. I have just heard of the loss  vessel belonging to my unkle bound to  Cales, by which  [I wrote] largely to you in Sepbr. [A mistake for October; see   and  .]  -- Such is the Luck of absent Friends. Suppose I have shared the same fate by the loss or Capture of the Fame which has not been heard of since she left  Amsterdam. I have written to you by the Captains Hayden and Cuznew who both sailed for  Amsterdam and by the Alliance which is once more gone to  France, by Trash to  Bilboa. I received by Capt. Sampson a very acceptable present 11 peices of Calico. They were as Good and as pretty as I could have wished for, but to my great misfortune so damaged by the long passage as some of them to be nearly ruined. When I received them, which was as soon as possible after his arrival, they were the  of them so wet and mildewed as I never saw any Goods before and this was the fate of his cargo except what was in his own Cabin. I am almost affraid to tell you, least you  you should be discouraged from trying again, that my Trunk at  Philadelphia was in as bad or worse State, by Mr. L-l  [Lovell's] account whose care I had requested, if it should arrive there. It was well I did, for it was oweing to his immediate attention, that every thing was not rotten which it contained. He was obliged to unpack and dry by the fire in his chamber every article which were many of them much damaged, the diaper and linnens the worst. I have otherways been fortunate, from  Bilboa and from  Holland every thing was in good order. My Box of china is safe at  Philidelphia where I believe it must remain for the present. The Fate of  the Southern States is  between Green and Cornwallis. The late Successes on  [illegible]   of General Morgan in  Carolina and at  Gorgia have occasioned the British Army to collect all  [their] force to that Quarter, we Dayly expect some important  [event.] By the loss of one British ship from  New York of 74 Guns and the damage of two others, the Capture of the Romulus by the French, the British were so  as to induce the Fleet of our Allies to plan an expedition to the Southward in order to give assistance to the American Arms in that Quarter. Two days after they sailed, all the British ships followed, even the disabled one with jury Masts, which shews their weakness. The French took their troops with them and  Road Island is now guarded by American millitia. The infamous Arnold by the last accounts was like to fall into the Hands of the justly incensed Americans. Such is our present anxious state. We have recent accounts of an attack upon  Eustatia by the Mad Britains and of a Declaration of war by  the united provinces. The Insolence  of Sir Joseph York s memorial was an abusive declaration of the British. Excuse haste written late in the Evening. I long to hear from you. When O! when will the time come. God Grant me happy tidings. My Love to my dear Sons, from whom I have not received a line for nine months.  Yours with sincere affection,   "
April 23 1781,"My Dearest Friend; You will wonder I suppose to what part of the world all the Letters you have written since  the 25 of   are gone, that not a line of a later date has reachd me, even up to this 23 day of April. My Heart sickens at the recollection, and I most sensibly feel the sacrifice of my happiness from the Malignant Union of Mars with Belona. My two dear Boys cannot immagine how ardently I long to fold them to my Bosom, or the still dearer parent conceive the flood of tenderness which Breaks the  [illegible]   the prescribed Bounds and overflows the Heart, when reflection upon the past, and anticipation upon the future unite in the mind of Portia. Unaccustomed to tread the stage of dissipation, I cannot shake of my anxiety for my Country and my dearest connextions, in the Beau Mond, whilst the one is Bleading, and the others seperated far, far from me, but in a frugal and republican stile; I pass the lonely Hour, with few enviers and fewer Imitators. Your predictions with regard to peace and war are verified and the  united Provinces are at last obliged to declare themselves. Happy for them if they had sooner attended to the voice of their Friends, they would then I dare venture to affirm been sooner upon their  against the Hostile depredations of  Britain, but if the old Batavian Spirit still exists among them,  Britain will Rue the Day that in Breach of the Laws of Nations, she fell upon their defenceless dominions, and drew upon her, as it is thought she must, the combined force of all the Neutral powers. If these people do not possess an ambition for conquest, yet they have heretofore exhibited a spirit superior to domination, that Spirit which prompted them to repel the Tyranny of Philip administerd by the cruel Alva, will excite them under superior advantages to Retaliate the Hostilities   of the British Alva, that Spirit which prompted from Prince William that Heroick reply, ""that he would die in the last Ditch, e'er he would see his Countrys ruin,"" will cement an indissoluble bond of union between the  united States of America and the  united Provinces who from a similarity of circumstances have each arrived at Independance disdaining the Bondage and oppression of a Philip and a Gorge. Our own American affairs wear a more pleasing aspect.  Maryland has  to the confederation at the very time when  Britain is deludeing herself with the Idea that we are crumbling to peices.  New York has given up her claims to  Vermont, and a 14tenth State will soon lift her Head under the auspices of Congress. Our Leavies are generally raised for 3 years and on their March to join the main Army. The Spring is advanceing and our Soldiers will have less occasion for cloathing -- patience, perseverance and intrepidity have been their Armour and their cloathing through an inclemnant Winter. Who is answerable for the shamefull conduct which deprived them of their outward cloathing which they had reason to expect and justice demanded. I presume not to say, but if the omission has arisen from fraud, negligence or cabal, may the inhumane wretches be exposed to view and meet the infamy they justly merrit. You will see by the paper  that the Seat of war is chiefly in  the Southern States, and there our Enemies by victories and defeats are wasteing daily, whilst they are training to Arms, and inureing to dicipline and hardships those states as they have before our Northern ones, to persue them to Inevitable distruction, and to prove to all  Europe the falsity of their assertions, when not a single State submits to their haughty userpations, in all their Boasted conquered dominions. Our  have been upon a much more respectable footing for some time. Goods of all kinds fell in their prices, and exchange kept at 75 for one for five months. The  Capture of  Eustatia and the War between  Holland and  england has raised Goods again Tea in a particular manner to double what it ever has been before, it was down to a hard dollor per pound or 75 it is now at 15 Shillings. I have thought that a small chest of about one hundred weight of Bohea Tea, would turn to as good an account as any thing you could send me. This Letter is to go by a vessel of Mr. Tracys. If you think it expedient you may order it by her, as it will come freight free if consigned to him, as the other articles were from  Bilboa. The best Green Tea I have ever had was that sent by Davis. If you send again, let it be Suchong, it is not so dear and answers better here. The  hankerchiefs from  Holland were the best article for sale I have ever received. The chints you were so kind as to order me by Sampson arrived -- safe I cannot say. They were put up with some things which came to Mr. Austins Brother and were so unfortunate as to be wet, and half of them damaged, mildewed and in a manner spoilt. I parted with them in the best manner I could, the damaged for rather more than the sterling cost and the others very well. They were all good as well as handsome which renderd it more unfortunate to have them wet, but the cargo was so in general. -- As to my long expected trunk, it has at last arrived in  Philadelphia. I am loth to discribe the state of it, because I am loth to make you angry, yet you ought to know it, least the person who put them up should again be imployed by you. I have neither Letter or invoice, which is the first time an omission of this kind has taken place. I cannot determine the price of a single article or know what were really put up, or what omitted. From your Letters alone in which you have repeated that all was orderd which was requested, and the omission loss of all Dr. Tufts things; leads me to think that the many others which are missing were stolen out. My Muslin hankerchiefs, Aprons, Nabbys plumes, Mr. Tufts Buckles, Brothers velvet, the linings and trimmings for the Gentlemens cloaths are among the missing articles. According to Mr. L-l  [Lovell's]  invoice for I have not yet seen them. When I found they would be like to go to  Philadelphia I requested Mr. L--l to receive them for me when ever they arrived, and it was well he did or what remaind would have been intirely lost. They were put in a Box without any wraper, through the cracks of which you might see the things; they were liable not only to be wet but plunderd, both of which they sufferd. Dr. Winship whom I have seen, says that when Mr. Moylan requested him to take them; he refused them, unless he would repack them, and purchase a hair Trunk for them; he replied that he had no money in his hands, that he had sent the account to you, and you had paid it, and that if he would not take it, he would deliver it to Capt. Jones, which he accordingly did; when Mr. L--l received them together with a Box for Mr. Gerry, they were in a smoaking state. He examined his, found them rotton upon which Mr. L--l unpacked mine and found them so wet as to oblige him to dry every thing by the fire. The linnings, the diaper all damaged, Mrs. Cranchs cambrick mildewed, happily the wollen cloths were only wet, the leather Gloves quite rotton. I could wish you to repeat that article by the first opportunity and order a peice of wollen between every pair as they are the most liable to damage by wet. The Box of china was deliverd safe to Mr. L--l. If this should reach you before the Alliance leaves  France be so kind as to order me one half a dozen tombour worked Muslin hankerchiefs, 4 Ells Book Muslin, one pound of white threads, 12 Ells of light crimson caliminco with a peice of coarse cambrick and any light wollen stuff that will answer for winter gowns, half a dozen coulourd plumes and a small Box of flowers for Miss Nabby at her request to her pappa. My chints came just in time to enable me to purchase the 3 part of a Man which 
Page 5
 fell to my share in the class to which I belonged at the head of which I had the Honour to stand. We gave 300 hard Dollors for 3 years, and a third part fell to my share, a third part is paid in hand, the remainder annually. The Town was divided into classes, and in about a months time the men were all raised. 38 fell to the share of this Town. Poor Mrs. D-a  says she is taxed to death and she shall be ruined if he stays any longer. What shall I say -- why that I have paid 21 hundred pounds since last july, Lawfull money, and have a thousand pound still to pay, and that you have enabled me to do it -- but I do not increase in wealth, nor yet diminish the capital. -- I have ventured to make some improvements in Husbandry and have a desire to become a purchaser in the State of  Vermont. I may possibly run you in debt a hundred dollors for that purpose. Many people are removeing from this Town, and others. Land is sold at a low price, what do you think of a few thousand acres there? I know you would like it, so shall venture the first opportunity a hundred and 20 or 30 dollors will Buy a thousand acres. I have written very often to you by way of  Spain and  Bilboa, which places I wish you would try. If you sent me any thing by the Fame, let me know. She is lost or taken -- and Mr. Guile we fear in her. Adieu my dear Friend my Love must suffice my dear Lads now. I have not time to write to them or Mr. T-r .  "
May 25 1781,"In this  month when Nature wears her gayest garb, and animal and vegetable life is diffused on every side, and when the Chearfull hand of industery is laying a foundation for a plentifull Harvest who can forbear to rejoice in the Season, or refrain looking  ""through Nature up to Nature's God""? While my Heart expands, it sighing seeks its associate and joins its first parent in that  Discriptive passage of Milton  [Eve's dialogue with Adam, Paradise Lost, book IV, lines 641-656.]  This passage has double charms for me painted by the hand of Truth, and for the same reason that a dear Friend of mine after having viewed a profusion of  pictures pronounced that which represented the parting of Hector and Andromaque to be worth them all.  The journal in which this is mentiond  does not add any reason why it was so, but Portia felt its full force, and paid a gratefull tear to the acknowledgment. This day my dear Friend  8 months since the date of  your last Letter , and 5 since it was received. You may judge of my anxiety. I doubt not but you have written many times since but Mars, Belona and old Neptune are in league against me. I think you must still be in  Holland from whence no vessels have arrived since the Declaration of War. Their are some late arrivals from  France, but no private Letters. I have had the pleasure of hearing of the Safety of several vessels which went from hence, by which I wrote to you, so that I have reason to think I have communicated pleasure tho I have not been  a partaker in the same way.  I have just written to you  by a vessel of Mr. Tracys, Capt. Brown bound for  Amsterdam which I hope will reach you. If you made use of  Bilboa your Friends there could forward ten Letters from thence, for one opportunity else where. Many vessels from  Boston and  Newbury are now bound there. This will be  to you by Mr. Storer, who is going first to  Denmark and who designs to tarry abroad some time. If you had been a resident in your own country it would have been needless for me to have told you that Mr. Storer is a young Gentleman of a Fair character, I need not add amiable manners as those are so discoverable in him upon the slightest acquaintance. You will not fail to notice and patronize him according to his merrit. We are anxiously waiting for intelligence from abroad. We shall have in the  a more respectable army than has appeard there since the commencement of the War and all raised for 3 years or during the war, most of them Men who have served before. The Towns have excerted themselves upon this occasion with a spirit becomeing patriots. We wish for a Naval force superiour to what we have yet had, to act in concert with our Army. We have been flattered from day to day, yet none has arrived, the Enemy exult in the Delay, and are improveing the time to ravage  Carolina and  Virginia. We hardly know what to expect from the  united provinces, because we are not fully  of their Disposition.  Britain has struck a blow by the Capture of  Eustatia sufficent to arouse and unite them against her, if there still exists that Spirit of Liberty which shone so conspicuous in their Ancestors and which under much greater difficulties led their hardy fore Fathers to reject the tyranny of Philip. I wish your powers may extend to an Alliance with them, and that you may be as successful against the Artifices of  Britain as  was against those of an other Nation when he negotiated an a triple Alliance in the course of 5 days with an address which has ever done Honour to his memory. If I was not so nearly connected, I should add, that there is no small similarity in the character of my Friend, and the Gentleman whose memoirs I have read with great pleasure. Our state affairs I will write you if the vessel does not sail till after Election. Our Friend Mr. C-h  goes from hence rep' by a unanimous vote. Dr. T-s  [Tufts] of  W-h  [Weymouth] is chosen Senator, our Govenour and Lieut. Govenour, as at the begining. Our poor old currency is Breathing its last gasp. It received a most fatal wound from a collection of near the whole Bodys entering here from the Southward. Having been informed that it was treated here with more respect, and that it could purchase a solid and durable Dress here for 75 paper Dollors, but half the expence it must be at there, traveld here with its whole train, and being much debauched in its manners  communicated the contagion all of a sudden and is universally rejected. It has given us a great Shock. Mr. Storer can give you more information. I have by two or 3 opportunities acquainted you that I received the calicos you  for me by Sampson, tho many of them were much injured by being wet. I have not got my things yet from  Philadelphia. I have acquainted you with my misfortune there, oweing to the bad package. I have no invoice from Mr. Moylan or Letter, tho I have reason to think many things have been stolen out as all Dr. T-s  [Tufts] are missing, and several of mine according to Mr. L-ls  [Lovells] invoice who was obliged to unpack what remaind and dry them by a fire, most of them much damaged. I have been more particular in other Letters. Our Friends in general are well,  in a declining way. I rather think the Good Lady will not continue many years, unless Her health mends. I fear not the present. She is anxious to hear from you whilst she lives, but bids me tell you not to expect to see her again. To my dear sons I shall write by this opportunity. I have not received a line from them for this twelvemonth. I hope they continue to behave worthy the Esteem of every body, which will never fail to communicate the greatest pleasure to their affectionate parents. I inclosed an invoice of a few articles by Capt. Brown. I will repeat it here. Any thing in the goods way will be an acceptable remittance to your ever affectionate   A List of Articles per Capt. Brown. Half a  Tambour worked Muslin hankerchiefs. 9 Ells Book Muslin. 1 pd. of white Threads. 12 Ells of light crimson caliminco. 1 peice of coarse cambrick. Any light wollen Stuffs that will answer for winter Gowns. 3 coulourd waveing plumes (all Stolen from Capt. Jones). A small Box of flower for Miss N-y  [Nabby], with a couple of peices of Genteel Ribbon. 6 Ells of white flowerd Gauze. 1 peice of fine Linnen.   "
May 27 1781,"My dearest Friend I have written so largely to you  by Mr. Storer who goes in the same vessel, that I should not have taken up my pen again, but in compliance with the request of  whose partner is going abroad, and desires a Letter to you as an introduction. Of Mr. Dexter the Bearer I know nothing but his Name. I have inclosed the Letter  [The enclosed letter has not been found.]  which I received from his partner who you know is a valuable Gentleman, and Eminent in his profession. As Election is not passed I have nothing New to add. My wishes for your Health and happiness and my anxiety to hear from you are an old Story. Should I tender you my warmest affections, they are of a date, almost with my first knowledge of you, and near coeval with my , yet not the less valuable I hope to a Heart that know not a change, but is unalterably the treasure of its ever affectionate   "
May 28 1781,"My Dearest Friend I could not have conceived that a Letter written upon merely political subjects could have communicated so much pleasure to my Bosom as yours of the 28th of December to , has given to mine. This Letter was taken by the Enemy, carried into  New York, and published by them, and republished  Edes. For what reason the Enemy published it I cannot tell, as it contains nothing which can possibly  [injure] us or the writer. It has proved a cordial to my anxious Heart for by it I find you were then living, and in  Amsterdam, two facts that I have not received under your own hand for 8 months. This Letter is 3 months later than any which has reachd me. Dr. Dexter by whom I have before written, has since, been polite enough to visit me, that he might, as he expresses it, have the pleasure to tell you, that he had seen me, and take from me any verbal message, that I would not  to write, but my pen must be the faithfull confident of my Heart. You I could not say to a stranger, that which I could not write, nor dare I even trust to my pen the fullness of my Heart. You must measure it, by the contents of your own when softned by recollection. Dr. Dexter appears to be a sensible well bred Gentleman, and will give you much information respecting our state affairs which may not be so prudent to commit to paper. I have written to  the House of de Neufvilla for a few articles by an other opportunity and have now inclosed a duplicate. I  you my dearest Friend to forward Letters to the various ports in  France as you have some acquaintance with many of them. I should then be able to hear oftner. Our Friends from  P-h  have made me a visit upon their remove to Neponset Hill which they have purchased of Mr. Broom. You will congratulate me I know upon my acquisition in the Neighbourhood, it is a very agreable circumstance. By them I learnt that the late vessels from  France had brought them Letters from their Son up to the 10 of March, in which he mentions being with my dear Friend, my Sons, and Mr. T-r  [Thaxter]. They have received five Letters, by different vessels yet not a line has yet blest my hand. May I soon be made happy, and the Number compensate for the delay. I hope you do not think it necessary to continue in  Holland through the summer. I am very anxious for your Health -- so flat a country will never agree with you. Pray do not be negligent with regard to an article which so nearly concerns the happiness of Your Ever affectionate   "
August 1 1781,"O that I could realize the agreeable reverie of  last Night when my dear Friend presented himself and two Son safely returnd to the Arms of the affectionate wife and Mother. Cruel that I should wake only to experience the a renual of my daily solicitude. The next month will compleat a whole year since a single Line from your Hand has reachd the longing Eyes of Portia. No vessels have arrived here since the declaration of war from  Holland. Congress have no dispatches later than october from you. I hope the and hope till hope is swallowed up in the victory of Dispair. I then consider all my anxiety as vain since I cannot benifit any one by it, or alter the established order of things. I cannot relieve your mind from the burden of publick cares, or at this distance alleviate the anxiety of your Heart, tho ever so much distressed for the welfare of your Native land or protect you from the Slanderous arrow that flieth in Secret, a Specimin of which you will find inclosed in a Letter from Mr. C-h  [Cranch] but which you must I think have received before as many coppies have been sent. My  [Indignation] is too big for utterance. I will not comment upon this low this dirty this Infamous  diabolical peice of envy  [illegible]  and malice  [illegible]   as I have already  [done] it where I thought I might be of service -- to your two Friends L  [Lovell] and G-y  [Gerry]. and the firm patriot whose views extend to the welfare of Mankind  obstructed by faction and vice, tho crossed by fortune, tho wounded by calumny and reproach, shall in the find in the end that his generous Labour is not lost -- even tho he meets with no other reward than that self approveing hour, which the poet tells us out weighs  whole years out weighs of stupid starers and of loud  [Huzzas]. When ever any opportunity occurs write, o write me a volume to amuse, to comfort and inform me. I turn to the loved pages of former days and read them with delight. They are all my comfort, all my consolation  in the long long interval of time that I have not received a line. Should I name my dear Boys a tear will flow with the Ink -- not a word line have I received from them for more than a Year. May they be their Fathers comfort and their Mothers delight. No very important military events have taken place since I wrote you last which was by Capt. Young to  Bilboa. Green is driving Cornwallis acting with much Spirit and . We are here looking upon each other in a mere maze. Our old currency died suddenly, the carkases remain in the hands of individuals, no Burial having been yet provided for it. The New was in Good repute but for a time, but all of a Sudden and in one day followed  [its] Elder Brother -- so that with old and New in my hand, I can not purchase a single Sixpence worth of any thing yet taxes must be paid, men must be raised for  Road Island and  West Point and paid too, yet the profits of what each one has sold for paper avails them not. This was a stroke of our Enemies by employing Emissaries to depreciate it who were detected and put into jail. Barter and hard money is now the only trade. The strugle will be to supply our army. How after having sold our commodities for paper we can raise hard money to pay the next demand which must be speedy, I know not. I had collected a sufficient Sum of paper to pay a very large tax which the last Session of the court levied. It now will avail me not a groat. I mentioned in  a former Letter  that  [I] wished you to send me a chest of Bohea tea by any vessel of Mr. Tracys or Smiths. It would turn into  [money] quicker   [The remainder of the letter is missing.]  "
Sepbr. 29 1781,"My dearest Friend Three days only did it want of a year from the date of  your last Letter , when I received by Capt. Newman in the Brig Gates  your welcome  of May 22d . By various ways I had collected some little intelligence of you, but for six months past my Heart had known but little ease -- not a line had  me from you, not a syllable from my children -- and whether living or dead I could not hear. That you have written many times, I doubted not, but such is the chance of War; and such the  [illegible]  misfortune attending a communication between absent Friends. I learn by Mr. Brush, that Mr. Dana is gone to Petersburgh, and with him . For this I am not sorry. Mr. Danas care and attention to him, I shall be well satisfied in -- and  Russia is an Empire I should be very fond of his visiting. My dear Charles I hear is comeing home in with Gillion. I know not your motives for sending him but dare say you have weighty reasons. That of his Health is alone sufficient, if the low countries are as prejudicial to him, as I fear they are -- and will be to his Father too. Why did you not write me about it? At first I  it, only by hearing of a list of passengers who were to come in the Indian, amongst which was a son of Mr. A-s. This made me very uneasy -- I had a thousand fears and apprehensions. Nor shall I be much at ease, you may well suppose, untill I hear of her arrival. I fear she will be an object, for the British to persue. The Event I must commit to the Supreme Ruler of the universe. -- Our Friends here are all well, your Mother has recoverd beyond my expectation, my Father too is in good Health for his years. Both our parents remember you with affection. General Green, is making the Requisition you require, and  the preliminarys for a Peace, by extirpating  the British force from  Carolina. We are from the present prospect of affairs in daily expectation that Cornwallis will meet the Fate of Burgoine. God Grant it -- and that this winter may produce to  America an honorable Peace. But my fears are well grounded when I add, that some of your Colleagues are unfit for the Buisness and I really am in suspence whether you will hold your Garbled commission, for reasons to which you will be no stranger before this reaches you. But if you resign, I am not the only person by hundreds who dread the consequences, as it is probable you will find, from instructions which I hear are to be sent, from several States to their delegates in Congress. You have a delicate part to act. You will do what you esteem to be your duty, I doubt not; fearless of consequences, and futurity will discriminate the Honest Man from the knave tho the present Generation seem little disposed to. I cannot write so freely as I wish. Your Memorial is in high estimation here. So you have set down at  Amsterdam in the House keeping way. What if I should take a trip across the  Atlantick? I tell Mrs. Dana we should pass very well for Natives. -- I have received a very polite Letter from Mr. DeNeufvilla. How did this Man discover, that extolling my Husband was the sweetest  in my ears? He has certainly touched the key which vibrates Harmony to me! I think I have requested you to send me a chest of Bohea Tea, by any vessel of Mr. Tracys. Do not think me extravagant -- I economize with the utmost Frugality I am capable of, but our Taxes are so high, and so numerous, that I know not which way to turn. I  60 hard dollars this week for a State and county Rate. I have 30 more to pay immediately for hireing a Man for 6 months in the Service, and a very large town tax, now comeing out. Hard Money is our only currency. I have a sum of old and new paper which lies by me useless at present. Goods of the  West India kind are low as ever they were -- Bills Sell  greatly below par. Hard money is very scarce, but I hope never to see an other paper Medium. Difficult as the times are, and dull as Buisness is, we are in a better situation than we were before. Where is my Friend Mr. Thaxter? that not a line has  me from him? His Friends are all well, but longing and impatient to hear from him. We see by the paper that he was well enough to celebrate independence on the fourth of july. -- The Robinhood had Letters to all my Friends which I hope you have received. I send many to  Bilboa, do you get any from thence, pray write to me by way of  France and  Bilboa. This is to go by a Brig to  France which I heard of but yesterday. You have I suppose received a commission for forming a  alliance -- such an one is made out. O my dear Friend, how far distant is the day when I may expect to receive you in your Native Land? Haughty  Britain sheath your sword in  to yourselves. Let not an other village be added to the long list of your depredations. The Nations around you shudder at your crimes. Unhappy  New London Named after your capital -- may she close the devastation. How many tender Sentiments rise to mind when about to bid you adieu. Shall I express them or comprise them all in the  of being ever Ever Yours  "
October 21 1781,"My dearest Friend It is now four weeks since Capt. Newman arrived in the Brig Gates and brought me  your Letter of the 22d of May . It wanted but a few days of a year from the date of  your last  when this reached me. Time which is said to soften and alleviate Sorrow,  anxiety when connected with expectation. This I hourly experience, and more particularly, since Mr. Brush acquainted me that my dear Charles was on Board Commodore Gillion. 3 frigates of the Enemies and a 50 Gun Ship the Chatham, are cruising upon our Coast for the vessels which are expected from  Holland. I tremble for the dangers to which he may be exposed from the Enemy, and of our coast, if he should not speedily arrive, but there is one consolation to which I must ever resort, in all my . I thank Heaven who has given me to believe in a superintending providence Guiding and Governing all things in infinate wisdom and ""to look through and trust the Ruler of the Skye."" From Mr. Brush I  something of your domestick affairs that you had taken a House in  Amsterdam, that you had Sent our eldest Son to  Petersburgh with Mr. Dana, and Charles Home on account of his Health -- and the desire he had to return again to his native Country, which must have been great indeed to induce the poor fellow to cross the atlantick without Father or Brother. How much does the anxious Heart of a Mother feel upon this occasion. No doubt you have some kind Friends, to whose care you have entrusted him, but I should have felt easier if you had written to me about it. The  arrived here and did me the honour of a visit soon after. He brought me  your favour from  Leyden dated March 11th . He has kindly offerd me a safe conveyance of my Letters, by covering them  himself to you, and by particular orders which he has promised to give about them. If you should write by way of  France I could wish you would send under cover to him. I am not without Suspicion that you have written by way of  France, and that they have been stoped. I know not how else, to account for my not hearing from you for so long a space of time. No doubt their are British Emissaries and American knaves employed for that purpose. I am told D--n is in  Holland -- for no good I dare say. The whole junto will be soon known in  America for a set of wicked unprincipled debauched wretches, from the old Deceiver down to the young Cockatrice. You flatter me with a pleasing Illusion that if ever you see your Native land again you will not quit it. If you once see it at peace, I should hope you would not, but  then, I can have little faith in the promise -- for tho you should return with that desireable object unaccomplished, the same principle which first led you to quit your family and Friends would opperate again, when ever you could be brought to believe that you could render your Country more Service abroad than at Home; altho providence has been pleased to seperate us, it is not with the mortifying reflection that you quited your Native Land through fear, malice or Ill Will towards it, but by the unanimous voice of a free people you were deputed to give peace to  Britain. Her haughty and unjust principles and sentiments have heitherto obstructed the Benevolent wishes of the  United States. -- Some late measures of   [Congress] have led the Friends of American Freedom to fear that an undue influence presides in her C-ls  [Councils], and that partiality will confer the recompence due to freedom virtue upon elegant and polished vice -- that  complasance is preferred to honest zeal, adulation, to Truth, and meaness of Spirit, to Elevation of Soul. Are We an Independant Nation? If we  are, why not speak a language becomeing a free people? You will receive dispatches no doubt before this will reach you that will serve to explain what I have said. You will see with whom and what you are colleagued. Some you can have little hopes of assistance from, considering their present situation -- and some will have no Inclination, but to obstruct your measures. But at present I see no prospect of your negotiating jointly or . Yet Cornwallis is in a most deplorable situation, his out works all taken, himself cooped up, and must be necessitated to surrender with his army soon from present appearences. Green is fighting like a Hero, as he is. I believe he has fought more Battles than any General in the Army, and has been as successfull. Our affairs look Brilliant I assure you. My dear dearest Friend write by every opportunity, why not by  Bilboa. It is  good and safe a way as any I know of. Do not if you can possibly prevent it, let me pass such an other twelve month as the year past. I have sighd enough to have borne your Letters over could they have reachd you. -- My Charles, o when shall I see him. May no misfortune befall him prays your ever   "
December 9 1781,"My Dearest Friend I hear the Alliance is again going to  France with the Marquis Fayett and the . I will not envy the Marquis the pleasure of Annually visiting his family, considering the risk he runs in doing it. Besides he deserves the good wishes of every American and a large portion of the Honours and applause of his own Country. He returns with the additional  of Laurels won at  York Town by the Capture of a whole British Army.  America may boast that she has accomplished what no power before her ever did, contending with Britain -- Captured two of their celebrated Generals and each an Army of thousands of veteran Troops to support them. This Event whilst it must fill  Britain with despondency, will draw the union already formed still closer and give us additional Allies; if properly improved must render a negotiation easier and more advantageous to  America. But I cannot reflect much upon  affairs; untill I have unburthend the load of my own Heart. Where shall I begin my list of Grievences? Not by accusations, but lamentations. My first is that I do not hear from you. A few lines only dated in April and May, have come to hand for 15 Months. You do not mention receiving any from me, except by Capt. Caznew, tho I wrote by Col. Laurence, by Capt. Brown, by Mr. Storer, Dexter and many others. By Babson to  Bilboa by Trash, and several times by way of  France. You will refer me to Gillion I suppose. Gillion has acted a base part, of which no doubt you are long e'er now apprized. You had great reason to suppose that he would reach  America, as soon or sooner than the Merchant vessels and placed much confidence in him, by the treasure you permited to go on Board of him. Ah! how great has my anxiety been, what have I not sufferd since I heard my dear Charles was on Board and no intelligence to be procured of the vessel for 4 months after she saild. Most people concluded that she was founderd at Sea, as she sailed before a voilent Storm. Only 3 weeks ago did I hear the contrary. My unkle dispatchd a Messenger the Moment a vessel from  Bilboa arrived with the happy tidings that She was safe at  Corruna, that the passenger had all left the Ship in consequence of Gillions conduct, and were arrived at  Bilboa. The vessel saild the day  that the passengers arrived at  Bilboa so that no Letters came by Capt. Lovett but a Dr. Sands reports that he saw a child whom they told him was yours and that he was well. This was a cordil to my dejected Spirits. I know not what to wish for. Should he attempt to come at this Season upon this coast, it has more Horrours than I have fortitude. I am still distresst. I must resign him to the kind protecting Hand of that Being who hath heitherto preserved him, and submit to what ever dispensation is alloted me. What is the matter with Mr. T-r , has he forgotten all his American Friends, that out of four vessels which have arrived, not a line is to be found on Board of one of them from him? I could  with the climate, but surely if it is subject to the Ague, there is a fever fit as well as the cold one. Mr. Guile tells me he was charged with Letters, but left them with his other things on Board the frigate, She gave him the Slip, he stept on Board Capt. Brown and happily arrived safe. From him I have learnt many things respecting my dear connextions, but still I long for that free communication which I see but little prospect of obtaining. Let me again intreat you to write by way of Guardoca,  Bilboa is as safe a conveyance as any I know of. -- Ah my dear John, where are you -- in so remote a part of the Globe that I fear I shall not hear a Syllable from you. -- Pray write me all the intelligence you get from him, send me his Letters to you. Do you know I have not a line from him for a year and half. -- Alass my dear I am much afflicted with a disorder call'd the  Heartach, nor can any remedy be found in  America, it must be collected from  Holland,  Petersburgh and  Bilboa. -- And now having recited my Greifs and complaints, the next in place are those of my Neighbours. I have been applied to by the Friends parents of several  Braintree youth to write to you in their behalf, requesting your aid and assistance if it is in your power to afford it. Capt. Cathcart in the privateer Essex from  Salem, went out on a cruise last April into the  Channel of England, and was on the 10 of June So unfortunate as to be taken and carried into  Ireland, the officers were confined there, but the Sailors were sent prisoners to  Plimouth jail 12 of whom are from this Town, a list of whom I inclose. The Friends of these people have received Intelligence by way of an officer who belonged to the Protector, and who escaped from the jail; that in August last they were all alive, several of them very destitute of cloathing, having taken but a few with them, and those for the Summer, particularly Ned Savils and Jobe Feild. There request is  that if you can, you would render them some assistance, if not by procuring an exchange, that you would get them supplied with necessary cloathing. I have told them that you would do all in your power for them, but what that would be I could not say. Their Friends here are all well, many of them greatly  for their Children, and in a particular manner the Mother of Jeriah Bass. I wish you to be very particular in letting me know by various opportunities  ways, after the recept of this, whether you have been able to do any thing for them, that I may relieve the minds of these distresst parents. The Capt. got home about 3 months ago, by escapeing to  France, but could give no account of his Men after they were taken. Two years my dearest Friend have  away since you left your Native land. Will you not return e'er the close of an other year? I will purchase you a retreat in the woods of  Virmont and retire with you from the vexations, toils and hazards of publick Life. Do you not sometimes sigh for such a Seclusion -- publick peace and domestick happiness, May the time, the happy time soon arrive when we may realize these blessings so elegantly  by Thomson, for tho many of your country Men talk in a different Stile with regard to their intentions, and express their wishes to see you in a conspicuous point of view in your own State, I feel no ambition for a share of it. I know the voice of Fame to be a mere weathercock, unstable as Water and fleeting as a Shadow. Yet I have pride, I know I have a large portion of it. I very fortunately received by the Apollo, by the Juno and by the Minerva the things you sent me, all in good order. They will enable me to do I hope without drawing upon you, provided I can part with them, but Money is so scarce and taxes so high, that few purchasers are found. Goods will not double, yet they are better than drawing Bills, as they cannot be sold but with a large discount. I could not get more than 90 for a hundred , should I attempt it. I shall  an invoice to the House of Ingraham Bromfild, and one to de Neufvilla. There is nothing from  Bilboa that can be imported with advantage, hankerchiefs are sold here at 7 dollers & half per dozen.  There are some articles which would be advantageous from  Holland, but Goods there run high, and the retailing vendues which are tolerated here ruin the Shopkeepers. The articles put up, by the American House were better in Quality, for the price than those by the House of de Neufvilla. Small articles have the best profit, Gauze, ribbons, feathers and flowers to make the Ladies Gay, have the best advance. There are some articles which come from  India I should suppose would be lower priced than many others -- bengalls, Nankeens, persian Silk and Bandano hankerchiefs, but the House of Bromfeild & C. know best what articles will suit here. I have been fortunate and unfortunate. The things which came in Jones remain at  Philadelphia yet. Our Friends here are all well.  is rather in better Health, and my Father is yet sprightly.  Believe me with more affection than Words can express ever Ever Yours, P.S. I have  a memorandom of some articles. I have not written to any one about them. You will give it to whom you think best and send it when you can. I shall in some future Letter mention a list of articles which I wish you to bring home with you whenever the happy time comes, but which I do not want without you. Adieu.  "
" December 23. 1781
","My Dearest Friend I knew not  half an hour ago that Mr. Guile intended for  Europe, he did not know it himself, it was a suden movement. He has not been able to come  [up?] as the vessel is expected to sail tomorrow, the Marquis and Count are already gone on Board.  I have written by them , but should have been more full and particuliar by Mr. Guile if I had sooner known of his intention. He can give you a full and particular account of our Situation at present. I need say nothing on that Head. He can tell you how anxious we have all been for , of whom I hear nothing further since his arrival at  Bilboa. He can tell you how much dissapointed I was that he should have all his papers on Board Gillion so that not one line reachd me. I have not a syllable of a later date than May. It seems as if a fatality attended all our exertions for cloathing, and for intelligence. I have so short warning that I have not a line for my Russian vissiter, have you heard from him? When O when shall I? I hope you enjoy your Health. I am anxious for you. My own I find infirm enough, my Nervous System is too easily agitated. I am frequently confined by slight indispositions to which I was always subject. I hope you have not experienced so much anxiety for our dear little Boy, as I have. It is not over.  I fear the Dangers of our coast, every Storm agitates me least he should be comeing upon the coast. I have written to you already that the things you  me all came safe to hand by the Minerva, by the Apollo and the Juno. I have  by the Count an invoice but have not written to any Body but to you about the articles. I also  to you a coppy of a Letter, said to have been published abroad. You may have seen it before, but if you have not, it is a curiosity. There is a great scarcity of Money here, and will be a greater I believe when our taxes are paid. I shall not draw upon you if you can continue to make me remittances as you have done. I enter not into the present stile and mode of living. The whole of your Sallery would be inadequate to the expence in which some live now, in furniture, equipage, cloathing and feasting, who were not worth ten Spanish milld Dollors when the war commenced. But this rant cannot last long, they must again descend to their nothingness. Excuse this hasty Scrawl. I would not that Mr. Guile should go without a line. Believe me at all times most assuredly yours. Inclosed is a letter. You will understand more about it when you receive my Letter by the Count de Noiales.  "
March 17th 1782,"My Dearest Friend  I know not of a single opportunity by which I can convey to You my constant anxiety and solicitude for your Health; or obtain from you any knowledge of your present situation, yet I cannot refrain writing my sentiments upon the knowledge I have been able to obtain concerning you here. There has been a motion in C-s  [Congress] to recall all their M  [Ministers] and s  [secretaries] except at  V-s  [Versailles] but it did not obtain. I have been in daily expectation for months past, that Letters would arrive from you requesting leave to resign your employments; and return again to your Native Land, assured at least of finding one Friend in the Bosom of , who is sick, sick of a world in which selfishness predominates, who is sick of counsels unstable as the wind, and of a servility to which she hopes your mind, will never bend. Most sincerely can she unite with you in the wish of a sequestered Life, the shades of  Virmont, the uncultivated Heath are preferable in her mind to the servility of a court. Some writer observes ""that censure is a tax that a Man pays the  for being eminent."" It is in the power of every Man to preserve his probity; but no man living has it in his power to say that he can preserve his reputation. Is it not in your power to withdraw yourself from a situation in which you are certain, no honour can be obtained to yourself or Country? Why Letters have not reached  America from you as well as from the minister at  Versails, and  Madrid since the extrodonary revocation of former powers, I cannot devine -- unless purposely stoped by Intrigues and Cabals. The minister at  Madrid has done himself and country Honour by refuseing to take a part in the New instructions. What changes may have taken place in the cabinets abroad since the Capture of Cornwallis, we have not yet . If  America does not improve it to her own advantage, she is deficient in that Spirit of Independance which has on former occasions distinguished her. It is true that her Finances are rather in an  state. Her Faith has been so often pledged, and having no stable funds, it has been so often forfeited to the undoing of those who confided most, that their is a distrust amongst her best Friends; C-s  [Congress] have not been able to obtain an impost of 5 pr cent which was recommended to be laid upon the importation of all Foreign articles, salt and military stores excepted, for the purpose of raising a revenue to be at the sole disposal of C-ss  [Congress]. it passt the House Thus  I wrote and laid by my pen untill I could hear  of an opportunity of conveyance. By a Letter last evening received from my unkle I was informed of a vessel soon to sail for  France. I reasume my pen, but my trembling anxious Heart scarcly knows what to dictate to it. Should I discribe all that has passd within it, since I heard of your illness, you would pitty its distresses. I fear the anxiety you have felt for the disgracefull concequences which your  [country] was about to involve themselves itself in, have affected your Health and impaired, your constitution. I well know how Essential the Honour and dignity of your country, its Independance and safety is, to your peace of mind and your happiness; if that cannot be promoted under present circumstances, let me intreat you to withdraw. Let me beg of you to resign; your Health suffers; my Health suffers from a dejection of Spirits which I cannot overcome --  It is this hope, this distant Idea that cheers my languid spirits and supports me through   [illegible]   perplexities. I mentioned to you that I had received no Letters from you of a later date than July, and in a former Letter I acquainted you that our dear Charles arrived here in January in good Health, and by him I first learnt that you had been sick. My Friends were not Ignorant of it, having some months before been made acquainted with it; by Letters from Mr. Ingraham to Mr. Daws, but they had carefully concealed it from me, knowing the distress it would give me, and supposeing it would be long before I should hear again from you. Your Letter to Charles in  Bilboa greatly alarmed me. God Grant that you may have recoverd your Health, and preserve a Life essential to the happiness of Portia. What a cordial, what a comfort would a Letter, with the happy tidings of your returned Health prove to the distressed Bosom of Portia. Heaven grant it speedily.  appears is perfectly happy in his safe return, to his dear Native Land, to which he appears the more attached from having visited foreign climes. May the promiseing dawn of future usefullness grow with his Growth and strengthen with his Strength whilst it sweetens the declining Life of those to whom he is most dear. Major Jackson to whose care you intrusted him, was high in his  and commendations. As I did not know in what  situation he was placed, I inquired of Major Jackson. He informd me that when he arrived at  Bilboa he drew a Bill upon you for money to answer his expences, that he had kept an account of Charles's which together with a small Balance he would leave at Col. Crafts where he lodged in  Boston for me; he was a second time at  Braintree, but said he had forgot his papers. Soon after he went for  Philadelphia, and I heard no more of him; or his papers -- which after a reasonable time I thought proper to inquire for, at his Lodgings, but was assured nothing was ever left for me. With regard to Charles passage the Captain and owners demand 25 guineys for it, which my unkle thinks very extravagent as he is well acquainted with passages, having both paid and received them from  Bilboa, 80 dollors being the extent, he ever gave or received even when the Capt  [Captain] found stores, which was not now the case, but the Capt says the other passengers gave that, and he expects the same for him. I must therefore be under the necessity of drawing upon you for it, as I cannot answer it without dissapointing myself of a favorite object; I mean a Lot of Land of 300 acers for each of our children in the New State of  Virmont, for which I have been very assidiously collecting all I could spair from taxes. They sell only 300 acers in a share and will not admit of one persons purchaseing more, so that the deeds must be made out in each childs or persons Name who is the purchaser. Several of our Friends have been purchaseing in the same Township, which is well situated upon two Rivers. I wish it was in my power to purchase 12 000 hundred for each instead of 3, but I dare not run Ventures. The Goverment is like to be amicably setled and in a few years it will become a flourishing place. -- Land here is so high taxed that people are for selling their Farms and retireing back. I can Instance to you one tax Bill which will shew you the difference of the present with the former. There are two acers and half of salt medow which you know you own in  Milton, it formerly paid 3 shillings tax, and this year 36. -- Mr. Alleyne has Burried his Mother and sister. He now wishes to sell his Farm and has accordingly put it upon sale. It is a place I should be fond of, but know it must still be my castle in the air. You are loosing all opportunities for helping yourself, for those who are daily  more and more unworthy of your Labours and who will neither care for you or your family when their own turn is served -- so selfish are mankind. I know this is a language you are unwilling to hear. I wish it was not a truth which I daily experience. I do not recollect through all your absence that I have ever found the person who has been inclined to consider me or my situation either on account of my being destitute of your assistance  or that you are devoteing your time and talents to the publick Service (Mr. Tracy excepted who has twice  [illegible]  refused the freight of a few articles from  Bilboa). It is true my spirit is too independant to ask favours. I would fain believe you have Friends who would assist me if I really stood in need, but whilst I can help myself I will not try them. I will not ask a person to lend me money who would demand 30 per cent for it. I will within I never yet borrowed for my expences, nor do I mean to do it. Charles passage I must draw upon you for, if they will not take a Bill. They may wait your return for borrow I will not. I shall add a list of a few articles which I wish you to send me, or rather Bring -- as you will I hope whatever you have in the House keeping way, when ever you return. I should be glad the List may be given to the House of Ingraham &c. They best know what will suit here and do  with more judgement and exactness as I found by what they once put up before. I shall depend wholy upon the remittances you may make me from time to time in the same way you have done. As to draughts I can make none but with loss. Goods are dull, but do better than Bills. Not a word from John since he went to  Russia, not a Line from Mr. Thaxter. If I have not time to write to him, let him know that his Friends are well and his Sister Loring has a daughter.  was well this week. Her Brother and sister di dined here to day. So did our  Milton Friends who desired to be rememberd to you. Mrs. Gray is this week to be married to Mr. S.A. Otis. Are you not too old to wonder? Mr. Cranch is recovering from a very dangerous Sickness in which his Friends all dispaired of his Life. My regards to all my Friends abroad.

March 17th 1781  [1782],"My dearest friend Altho I no nought of a single opportunity,  "
April l0th 1782,"My dearest Friend How great was my joy to see the well  Signature of my Friend after a Melancholy Solicitude of many months in which my hopes and fears alternately preponderated. It was January when  arrived. By him I expected Letters, but found not a line; instead of which the heavy tidings of your illness reachd me. I then found my Friends had been no strangers of what they carefully conceald from me. Your Letter to Charles dated in November 2 was the only consolation I had; by that I found that the most dangerous period of your illness was pass'd, and that you considerd yourself as recovering tho feeble. My anxiety and apprehensions from that day untill your Letters arrived, which was near 3 months, conspired to render me unhappy. Capt. Trowbridge in the Fire Brand arrived with your favours of  October  and December   and in some measure dispeld the Gloom which hung heavy at my heart. How did it leap for joy to find I was not the misirable Being I sometimes feared I was. I felt that Gratitude to Heaven which great deliverences both demand and inspire. I will not distrust the providential Care of the supreem disposer of events, from whose Hand I have so frequently received distinguished favours. Such I call the preservation of my dear Friend and children from the uncertain Element upon which they have frequently embarked; their preservation from the hands of their enimies I have reason to consider in the same view, especially when I reflect upon the cruel and inhumane treatment experienced by a Gentleman of Mr. Laurences age and respectable character. The restoration of my dearest Friend from so dangerous a Sickness, demands all my gratitude, whilst I fail not to supplicate Heaven for the continuance of a Life upon which my temporal happiness rests, and deprived of which my own  would become a burden. Often has the Question which you say staggerd your philosophy occured to me, nor have I felt so misirable upon account of my own personal Situation, when I considerd that according to the common course of Nature, more than half my days were allready passt, as for those in whom our days are renewed. Their hopes and prospects would vanish, their best prospects, those of Education, would be greatly diminished -- but I will not anticipate those miseries which I would shun. Hope is my best Friend and kindest comforter; she assures me that the pure unabated affection, which neither time or absence can allay or abate, shall e'er long be crowned with the completion of its fondest wishes, in the safe return of the beloved object; the age of romance has long ago past, but the affection of almost Infant years has matured and strengthend untill it has become a vital principle, nor has the world any thing to bestow which could in the smallest degree compensate for the loss. Desire and Sorrow were denounced upon our Sex; as a punishment for the transgression of Eve. I have sometimes thought that we are formed to experience more exquisite Sensations than is the Lot of your Sex. More tender and susceptable by Nature of those impression which create happiness or misiry, we Suffer and enjoy in a higher degree. I never wonderd at the philosopher who thanked the Gods  that he was created a Man rather than a Woman. I cannot say, but that I was  when I found that your return to your native land was a still distant Idea. I think your Situation cannot be so dissagreable as I feared it was, yet that dreadfull climate is my terror. -- You mortify me indeed when you talk of sending Charles to Colledge, who it is not probable will be fit under three or four years. Surely my dear Friend fleeting as time is I cannot reconcile myself to the Idea of living in this cruel State of Seperation for  [4?] or even three years to come. Eight years have already past, since you could call yourself an Inhabitant of this State. I shall assume the Signature of Penelope, for my dear Ulysses has already been a wanderer from me near half the term of years that, that Hero was encountering Neptune, Calipso, the Circes and Syrens. In the poetical Language of Penelope I shall address you You will ask me I suppose what is become of my  virtue? It is that which most ardently calls for your return. I greatly fear that the climate in which you now reside will prove fatal to your Life, whilst your Life and usefullness might be many years of Service to your Country in a more Healthy climate. If the Essentials of her political system are safe, as I would fain hope they are, yet the impositions and injuries, to which she is hourly liable, and daily suffering, call for the exertions  of her wisest and ablest citizens. You know by many years experience what it is to struggle with difficulties -- with wickedness in high places -- from thence you are led to covet a private Station as the post of Honour, but should such an Idea generally prevail, who would be left to stem the torrent? Should we at this day  possess those invaluable Blessings transmitted us by our venerable Ancestors, if they had not inforced by their example, what they they taught by their precepts? Why should I indulge an Idea, that whilst the active powers of my Friend remain, they will not be devoted to the Service of his country? Can I believe that the Man who fears neither poverty or dangers, who sees not charms sufficient either in Riches, power or places to tempt him in the least to swerve from the purest Sentiments of  and Delicacy; will retire, unnoticed, Fameless to a Rustick cottage there by dint of Labour to earn his Bread. I need not much examination of my Heart to say I would not willing consent to it. Have not Cincinnatus and Regulus been handed down to posterity, with immortal ? Without fortune it is more than probable we shall end our days, but let the well earned Fame of having Sacrificed those prospects, from a principal of universal Benevolence and good will to Man, descend as an inheritance to our .  The Luxery of Foreign Nations may possibly infect them but they have not before them an example of it, so far as respects their domestick life. They are not Bred up with an Idea of possessing Hereditary Riches or Grandeur. Retired from the Capital, they see little of the extravagance or dissipation, which prevails there, and at the close of day, in lieu of the Card table, some usefull Book employs their leisure hours. These habits early fixed, and daily inculcated, will I hope render them usefull and ornamental Members of Society. -- But we cannot see into futurity. -- With Regard to politicks, it is rather a dull season for them, we are recruiting for the Army. The Enemy make sad  with our Navigation. Mr. Lovell is appointed continential Receiver of taxes and is on his way to this State. It is difficult to get Gentlemen of abilities and Integrity to serve in congress, few very few are willing to Sacrifice their Interest as others have done before them. Your  of december 18th  came by way of  Philadelphia, but all those Letters sent by Capt. Reeler were lost, thrown over Board. Our Friends are well and desire to be rememberd to you. Charles will write if he is able to, before the vessel sails, but he is sick at present, threatned I fear with a fever. I received one Letter from my young Russian to whom I shall write -- and from Mr. Thaxter. If the vessel gives me time I shall write. We wait impatiently for the  result of your demand. These slow slugish wheels are move not in unison with our feelings. Adieu my dear Friend. How gladly would I visit you and partake of your  and cares, sooth you to rest, and alleviate your anxieties were it given me to visit you even by moon Light, as the faries are fabled to do. I cheer my Heart with the distant prospect. All that I can hope for at present, is to hear of your welfare which of all things lies nearest the Heart of  "
April 25 1782,"My Dearest Friend Whenever any difficulty encompasses me, my  thought is how would my Friend conduct in this affair. I wish to know what his mind would be and then to act agreable to it. If I err in my conduct it is an error of the judgement, not of the Heart. Wholy deprived of your aid, and even advice in domestick occurences, my next resource is in that of my Friends. My present difficulty arrises from the demand upon me for C-s  [Charles] passage Home. I have once written to you  respecting it, but least you should not receive it, I repeat several things already written together with what has since . When Mr. J-n  [Jackson] arrived and came to  B-e  [Braintree] to see me, I inquired of him what measures he had taken with regard to C-s  [Charles] expences after he left Gillion, where I presumed you had provided for him. I had received no Letters from you, so that I was wholy Ignorant. He replied that when he arrived at  Bilboa he drew a Bill upon Mr. de Nuffville a part of which he appropriated to C-s use, of which he had informd you, that he had not his accounts with him, a memorandum excepted of a few articles, that he had not paid the expences from Beverly, where they first arrived, but as soon as he had done it, he would make up the account and send it, to together with a balance which he had left, of a few dollors. He then Shew me the Mem'dum, which containd as near as I can recollect a charge of 57 dollors for Stores, one peice of linnen of an ordinary Quality, the price I forget (this he thought necessary as C-s had lost half his shirts together with one pair of sheets, stockings &c. stolen from him), 2 yard of Cambrick, 2  Barcelona hank-fs  [handkerchiefs] and a Hat which was charged 4 dollors, C-s having his in Mr. Guiles Trunk with some other articles and that I suppose you know before this time was on Board Gillion. A Sailors Baize jacket and trousers compleated the mem'dum. With regard to the expences of living there, you are better acquainted than I am, and must judge for yourself, as I have not a single paper that will enable me to do it. After waiting some time I sent to Col. Crafts where Major J. lodged for the papers, but he was not at home, and there was none left. The same Week he went to  Hingham to see General L-n  [Lincoln], and calld upon me. He then told me that he had left a Letter at Col. Crafts together with the papers which belonged to me but comeing unexpectedly he forgot to take them. He returnd in a day or two from  Hingham and immediately set of for the Army since which I have neither heard of him or his papers, for upon applieing for them, I received for answer that there was not any thing left for me, if there had have been, the earliest opportunity would have been taken to have forwarded it. I have stated facts. You know this Gentleman much better than I do, so I shall not comment. After he had informd me with regard to the Bill he drew, I inquired what had been done with regard to the passage. To this he replied that no agreement had  been made with Capt. Hill respecting C-s, but that the other passengers paid 25 Guineys.Supposeing that they would not make the like demand for the passage of a child, I wrote to Capt. Hill desireing to know what I was indebted to him, but I heard not a word from him untill some time this MonthI received a Letter a coppy of which I inclose together with my unkles Letter   [this enclosed letter from Isaac Smith to Abigail Adams has not been found] , my reply to Hill and his answer. Upon my unkles hearing what the other passengers gave, he said it was an unreasonable demand, and that advantage was taken of the situation of the passengers. He went to the Agent and then to Capt. Hill, but to no purpose, as you see by the inclosed.Hill says, they were a month in passing from  Corunna to  Bilboa and that they then lived at the expence of his owners, that the other passengers agreed to give it, and that he will not take less. I think you would not advise me to enter into an altercation with him which would give me much trouble, and very little if any relief. You see by the inclosed that I requested him to take Bills and by his reply that he wanted a discount of 15 per cent. I sent him word that I would draw Bills, but that I would not discount. He said if he had the money he could Buy Bills at 20 per cent discount, and he would not take them at a less than he had offerd. I went to Town to see if I could not do better, I tried one and then an other. Some had no money, others did not want Bills. At last a cousin of mine in whose favour it is probable I must draw the Bills,offerd to pay the money for me, and take the Bills at 10 per cent discount, if I could not do better. I might try and if I could dispose of them to better advantage he should be content, he accordingly paid the money, and I am still trying to get them accepted, but cannot yet effect it. I could pay the Money myself but I must then relinquish the object I have in view, of purchaseing an original Right in the State of  Virmont and I have brought that matter so near a close that I think you would not advise me to do it. I expect the deeds in a week or two for 16 hundred and 20 acres of Land when I must pay the money. As it is in the Neighbourhood of some of our Friends who are purchasers, and I have set my Heart upon it, I am loth to relinquish it. The Town is called  Salem, laid out in lots of 300 & 30 acres, no one person permitted to own more than one Lot in the same township, but you may purchase in the Names of yourself and children. I have engaged one for my best Friend and each of our children. The 5 lots will amount to 200 Dollors. At the expiration of 5 years there is a House to be built of 18 feet square and a family setled, or 5 acres of Land cleared upon each Lot. No taxes to be paid untill the expiration of 5 years. I shall soon be able to be more particular. Every person of whom I have inquired agree, that it is a fine Country, and will daily become more and more valuable. This Town is situated upon two 
Page 3
 navigable Rivers. There internal affairs are in a good way, and they are now sending delegates to congress. If you approve of what I have done, and should like to purchase further I shall have more opportunities. Remittances in Goods, tho they will only double the sterling cost, are preferable to Bills in which I am under a necessity of becomeing a looser. I told you before that I had very seldom met with any person who either considerd my situation or yours, any other than to make a proffit if they could. Our Brother C-h would help me if it was in his power, and is every ready and willing to do for me what ever he can. About six months ago I placed a hundred pounds Sterling in the hands of a Friend but I am loth to break upon it, as I know it to be in good hands and promised not to call for it without giving them 3 months warning. I have  to make the best of what ever remittances you have made me. The necessary repair of Buildings, the Anual Call for 3 years Men, and the very large taxes which are laid upon me oblige me to the strickest frugality. I cannot but think I am hardly delt by, being rated in to 20 shillings as much as Mr. Alleyne of this Town, who has 3 polls, and I none. He estimates his place at 3000 sterling, whilst I believe you would take half the money for yours, but he cannot find a purchaser for his. The rage for purchaseing land ceased with the paper currency, and the taxes are felt severely enough. I complain but without redress. With regard to remittances calicos answer well especially chocolate ground, as they are  Blew ground or Green ground. They should be coulourd stripes or flowers; ribbons are still more profitable gauze tape fine threads  [Menting ?]hankerchiefs Bandano hankerchiefs coulourd tamies or Calimincos, black serge denim Bindings either shoe or Quality. The House of Sigourney Bromfield &c. best know what will answer here. I close this Letter being wholy upon Domestick Matters with assureances of the affectionate regard of your       "
June 17. 1782,"My dearest Friend There is not any thing in this Life, now my Dear Friend is  from me, that can communicate equal delight and pleasure to that which I feel upon the Sight of Letters written in the well known Hand of my Friend. My Heart Leaps forward to meet them, whilst the trembling Hand uncloses the Seals, and my eager Eyes devour the contents; tho unwilling to reach the close. Capt. Deshon had the good fortune to arrive safe and brought me Letters only six weeks old   ; these were a cordial to my Spirits; since your first residence in  Holland, I have not experienced the happiness of hearing from you in so short a space of time. The prospect which was opening before you, and the Success with which I hope before this time your negotiations have been Blessed, has communicated a pleasure to my mind, which no one can feel in an equal degree with her, whose happiness is so nearly connected with all you Hope, and all you wish. What  old ocean rolls between these vehicles of transitory duration, the immortal Spirit can unite with its kindred mind, and participate in its pains and pleasures. My dear Friend will feel the truth of what I have now asserted, and mingle the sorrowing tear with Portia, and with a distressed family over the almost departing  of our Dear Brother Cranch. I wrote you some time ago  an account of the severe fit of Sickness with which he was visited, during the winter, but it then pleased Heaven to restore him to some degree of Health. His eager desire to be upon his duty in the  Service, overpowerd the advice of his Friends: and he went to Town, before he had sufficiently recoverd his Health, where he was: only a few days, before he was seized with a pain in his Breast and Side, which terminated in a fever upon his Lungs and immediately threatned his Life. He however struggled through the fever, but is now apprehended by his phisicians and Friends to be in a Hectick, accompanied with dropsical Symptoms. He however, as is common in such cases, flatters himself that he shall get well, tho tis 7 weeks since he was taken, and he can scarcly walk his room. He rides out, but cannot bear food equal to an Infant, whilst a cough and swelling of his Stomack, bowels and Legs indicate a speedy dissolution. For him we need not heave an anxious Sigh -- but his family -- his Friends. -- You who know his worth can feel their, and your own loss. I dare not flatter myself -- my Hopes and fears are at varience. The anxious distress of an afflicted Sister Bears a load of Sorrow to my Heart, whilst I supplicate Heaven that I may not be called to experience a like overwhelming calamity. ""O! Spair him, Spair him, Gracious power: O! Give him to my latest Hour"" is the constant prayer of Portia. I reassume my pen, and would tell you that I last evening received from  Philadelphia a Letter written May 29, 1781 written Immediately after you took a House in Amsterdam; I suppose it to be one of those which was put on Board Gillion -- as he has at last arrived at  Philadelphia, having been commodore at the taking of  Providence by the Spainards. Our poor Charles would have had a fine time of it, if he had continued on Board.  I wrote you  by the Fire Brand, that I had drawn a Bill upon you for C-s  passage, but finally finding I could not do it without a discount of ten per cent, and failing in an object which I then had in view, making a purchase in  Virmont, on account of the dissagreable turn which affairs took at that time, relative to that state, when it was in the fairest way of being setled, I was advised not to purchase for the present, upon which I paid the passage. I shall not pretend unless upon a pressing necessity, which I do not at present see, to draw any Bills. The Remittances which you have from time to time made me, and which I have been very fortunate in receiving, assist me much better than Bills upon which I must pay a discount. I shall inclose a List of Articles upon which the best profit arrises, and which have the quickest sale. I have a Friend or two, into whose Hands I put what I do not want for my own family, who dispose of them for me. Accept my thanks for those received by Deshon. They came in good order. Mr. L--l not long since  me with the sight of two Letters from you dated in February."" With regard to the cypher of which you complain, I have always been fortunate enough to succeed with it. Take the two Letters for which the figure stands and place one under the other through the whole Sentance, and then try the upper Line with the under, or the under with the upper, always remembering, if one letter answers, that directly above or below must be omitted, and sometimes several must be skiped over. The contents of those Letters gave me a clearer Idea of the difficulties you have had to encounter, than I before had conceived of. But it must be a pleasing reflection to you that your Labours are at last like to be crowned with Success. I wish there was as fair a prospect of an Honorable peace. I hope the late Naval disaster of our Allies will not have a dissagreable Effect upon the  united provinces. The english will puff and vaunt their Dear Bought victory, without once recollecting that pride commeth before Humility and a haughty Spirit before a fall. The Cabinet counsels of  Britain are held in detestation here, and to be insulted by the New Ministry is  in a more contemptable Light, than the same offers would have been from the old.  America cannot but consider the virtues as all fled from that devoted Island. The different States are instructing their delegates to consider every offer as an insult from  Britain (which should give a new edge  to their Swords) if Independance is not made the Basis. Ardently as I long for the return of my dearest Friend, I cannot feel the least inclination to a peace but upon the most liberal foundation. Patriotism in the female Sex is the most disinterested of all virtues. Excluded from honours and from offices, we cannot attach ourselves to the State or Goverment from having held a place of Eminence. Even in the freeest countrys our property is subject to the controul and disposal of our partners, to whom the Laws have given a soverign Authority. Deprived of a voice in Legislation, obliged to submit to those Laws which are imposed upon us, is it not sufficient to make us indifferent to the publick Welfare? Yet all History and every age exhibit Instances of patriotick virtue in the female Sex; which considering our situation equals the most Heroick of yours. ""A late writer observes that as Citizens we are calld upon to exhibit our fortitude, for when you offer your Blood to the State, it is ours. In giving it our Sons and Husbands we give more than ourselves. You can only die on the field of Battle, but we have the misfortune to survive those whom we Love most."" I will take praise to myself. I feel that it is my due, for having sacrificed so large a portion of my peace and happiness to promote the welfare of my country which I hope for many years to come will reap the , tho it is more than probable unmindfull of the hand that blessed them. Your Friends complain that you do not write to them. I say all I can in excuse, but I wish you to notice them all, and in a particular manner to continue your affectionate Regard and attachment to   "
July 17 1782,"My dearest Friend I have delayed writing till the vessel is near ready to Sail, that my Letters may not lay 3 weeks or a month after they are written, as is commonly the case.  and Lady are going passengers in this vessel; and tho I have only a slight knowledge of them I shall commit my Letters to their care. I have not heard from you since the arrival of Capt. Deshon. Your last Letters were dated in March   .  I replied to them  by the last vessel which saild for France dated about a month ago tho she has not sailed more than a fortnight. I again grow impatient for intelligence. From the last accounts which reachd us by way of  Nantys we learn that the Dutch are acquiring a firmness of conduct, that they have acknowledged the independance of  America, and are determined to turn a deaf Ear to that prostituted Island of  Britain. If this is true, and I sincerely hope it is, I congratulate you upon the Success of your negotiations, and hope your Situation is more eligible than for the time past. If I know you are happy, it will tend to alleiviate the pains of absence. The Count de Grasse misfortune in the  West Indias, we sensibly feel. The British will feed upon it for ages, but it will not save their Nation from the destruction which awaits them. The Season has advanced thus far without any military Exploit  on either Side. We want the one thing necessary for persueing the War with Vigor. Were we less Luxurious we should be better able to support our Independance with becomeing dignity, but having habituated ourselves to the delicacies of Life, we consider them as necessary, and are unwilling to tread back the path of Simplicity, or reflect that Man By the  I gave you a particular account of the dangerous Situation our dear Brother Cranch is in. He still continues, but we have little to build our hopes upon of his long continuance here upon with us. Heaven be better to us than our fears. The rest of our Friends are well. Charles has been to see a publick Commencement; and has returned to night much gratified with the exhibitions. He has followed his Studies with attention, since his return, under the care of a Mr. Thomas of  Bridgwater; who appears well calculated for the instruction of youth; and is said by good judges, to be an admirable proficient in the Languages. But with him we are obliged to part immediately, as he is going into Buisness. I know not what to do with my Children. We have no Grammer School in the Town, nor have we had for 5 years. I give this Gentleman 2s. 6 pr week a peice, for my two. I must (could I find a School abroad to my mind) Board them at 18 Shillings pr week which is the lowest. In  Boston 6 and 8 dollers is given by Gentlemen there for Board, formerly a Gentleman Boarded as well for 12 Shillings, but such is the difference.  I know not how to think of their leaving Home. I could not live in the House were it so deserted. If they are gone only for a day, it is as silent as a Tomb. What think you of your daughters  to keep House for you? She proposes it. Could you make a Bridge she would certainly present herself to you, nor would she make an ungracefull appearence at the Head of your table. She is rather too silent. She would please you the better. She frequently mourns the long absence of her Father, but she knows not all she suffers in consequence of it. He would prudently introduce her to the world, which her Mamma thinks proper in a great measure to seclude herself from, and the daughter is too attentive to the happiness of her Mamma to leave her much alone, nor could repeated invitations nor the solicitation of Friends joined to the consent of her Mamma, prevail with her to appear at commencement this year. But much rather would the Mamma and daughter embrace the Husband and Father in his Native Land than think of visiting foreign climes. Will the cottage be sweet? Will Retirement be desirable? Does your Heart pant for domestick tranquility, and for that reciprocation of happiness you was once no stranger to. Is there ought in Courts, in Theaters or Assemblies that can fill the void? Will Ambition, will Fame, will honour do it. Will you not reply -- all, all are inadequate, but whether am I led? I cannot assume an other Subject -- the Heart is softned. Good night. Sol rises this morning with great splendor. I had much rather have seen his face overspread with clouds  their fruitfull drops to the thirsty earth. It is very dry. Our Corn suffers. Should we be cut of or shortned in our crops we should more sensibly feel it, as our celebrated Siberian wheat is universally blasted, and much of the Rye. Our Success with a little last year led my Tennant to sow 3 acres this year, which we were obliged to mow for foder. Col. Quincy succeeded last year, and raised a hundred and sixty Bushels of as fine wheat as I ever saw, but his Has shared the same fate, and it is so where ever I hear of it. My favorite  Virmont is a delightfull Grain Country. I cannot tell why, but I feel a great fondness for the prosperity of that State. I wrote you in my last that I had laid aside the thoughts of being an adventurer there for the present -- but soon after Col. Davis of  Woster to whom the township was granted, with his associates, brought me the Charter, and the proceedings of Congress with Regard to  Virmont by which it appears that  Virmont had complied with the requisitions of Congress and the committe to whom, the Matter was committed, report that having complied they consider Congress as obliged to set them of and ratify their independance. This Gentleman has taken pains to have every propriater persons of character and property and that they should all belong to this State. He says it is one of the best situated townships in the State, and will rise in value daily.  Salem is the Name  it bears. As he had got the deeds all drawn and executed I recollected the old adage Nothing venture nothing have; and I took all the Lots 5 in number 4 of which I paid him for, and the other obligated myself to discharge in a few months. You are named in the Charter as original propriater, so no deed was necessary. Each lot is to contain 300 and 30 acres at about 11 pounds a Lot. This payment has reduced my purse pretty low; having a little before paid Charles passage and repaird Buildings to the amount of a hundred dollers. My taxes I might mention as a heavy load, but as every Body complains, I will be silent, tho I might with as much reason; my continental tax which I am calld upon to pay next week, and is only a half year tax, amounts to 50 dollers. 19 pounds 15 & 10 pence I paid about a Month ago for a State tax and 7 pounds 10 & a pence for a town tax and 6 pound some shillings for a ministerial tax, to make up paper money deficiencies, besides 9 pounds 13 & six pence for Class number 7 towards hireing a Man for 3 years. All this I have discharged since April, as will appear by my Receits. I have not drawn any Bills and will not if I can possibly help it. I shall have no occasion to, if I can get black and white Gauze and Gauze . It may not be to the Credit of my country but it is a certain fact, that no articles are so vendible or yeald a greater profit. It was with difficulty I could keep a little for my own use of what I last received.  I inclosed a list of articles  by the Enterprize which I wish you to direct Ingraham and Bromfield to forward, and should they meet with the same Success my former adventures have, and arrive safe, they will be much more benificial than drawing Bills upon which I must discount. I shall inclose a duplicate of the articles with an addition of 5 yard of scarlet Broad cloth of the best kind and 3 yard of Sattin of the same coulour which I want for my own use leaving it at all times to you to determine the Quantity which you think proper to remitt. You have heard I suppose that Gillion arrived at  Philadelphia in . Only two Letters have come to hand. Dr. Waterhouse left him at the  Havanah but was unfortunately taken upon his passage home and carried to  New York, by which means the rest of the Letters perished. --  I wrote you  by the Alliance respecting the  Braintree prisoners, but have not received a line in which you make mention of them. That you took measures to relieve them several have testified to their Friends, but it would be more satisfactory if you had mentiond them yourself. There is in  Boston a Mr. Marstins' who belonged on Board Gillion who paid yesterday to Charles in  Boston a Jo which he said you lent him. I mention this to his Honour and justice. Of all the money due to you, upon Book or note, I have not received a copper since your absence and must have been distresst but for the remittances you have made me. I long to receive Letters  from all my dear Friends. I wish you would write by way of  France and send your Letters to Mr. Warren. He would be particuliarly carefull of them. Two vessels have  just arrived in 30 days passage from  Nants. Your Friends here make great complaint, that you do not write to them. Uncle S  [Smith] says he will not write you any more, yet believe he does not keep his word, for he writes by every vessel. Genrll. W-n  [Warren] says you have forgotton him and Dr. T-s  [Tufts] complains. You see how important a line from you is considerd. I say all I can for you, but wish you would find leisure to notice those Friends who write to you. Uncle Q-y  desires his regards to you. Your aged Mamma wishes to see you, but fears she never will shall. My Father injoys as Good State of Health as his years will admit. My most affectionate regards to my Dear John from whom I have received but one Letter since his visit to  P  [Petersburg].  has just been giving me a Letter for you. I read it, and really beleive the child thinks herself serious; but you can give her better advice.   [This enclosed letter has not been found.]  Mr. Foster has just sent me word that he designs to wait upon me to morrow for Letters so that I shall give them to Him as he is kind enough to come out to see me. You will not fail to take notice of him.  Mrs. Warren has left this  with a request that she may have these articles and she will pay the money to me or send to her Son for any thing I may want from  France, but at present I know of nothing, so that I should be glad if they are sent they may not be put with any thing which belongs to me, but invoiced and put up by them selves. "
August 5th '82  [1782],"My dearest Friend I know not any pleasure equal to that which arises from feeding the Hungry,  the Naked and making the poor prisoners Heart sing for joy. All the Honours which your Country has conferd upon me you has never excited in my mind half the Satisfaction which your Benevolent exertions and generous aid to the poor prisoners which  I recommended to you , has given me. I am sorry not to have learnt any thing from your own pen with regard to them, but they have not been deficient in manifesting their gratitude to you, and making mention of their your kindness, to their Friends here by every opportunity, nor could I help feeling the Lamentation of a  Milton prisoner to his Friends, that it was his misfortune not to be a  Braintree Man. Your Benevolence would lead you to do all in your power for the releaf of all those unhappy persons who are in confinement, yet those who were your towns Men and Neighbours have a particular claim to your attention. I expect a Letter to inclose from the Father of Lewis Glover. If you could forward it to him they will consider it as an additional favour and further let them know that all their Friends are well, which I suppose may be done through the commissary of prisoners. They frequently send Letters to their Friends here, but how I know not. I yesterday saw Mr. Foster, as  I hope he will tell you in a months time, I gave him Letters which he has promised to deliver safe. You so seldom acknowledge the recept of any Letters from me, that but for many of the vessels arriveing safe, I should suppose they never reachd you. There are Letters in  Boston from Mr. Ingraham I am told so late as May, by the Ship Thomas from  Nants. How happy would it have made me to have learnt by a line from you that you was well. What greater hazard would your Letters meet with by way of  France than mine, especially coverd to the Consul Le Etomb. You will find in  one of the Letters  a   [from] Mrs. W-n  [Warren] the articles of china which she has mentiond she supposes may be purchased for 20 dollors. I think she must be mistaken. She has given a different direction as you will see per the inclosed. I should like to prog a little too if I thought you could afford it. I will not disown having already done it in some things, but tis but a little. I sent for a compleat set of china for a dining table some time ago, I know not whether you received the Letter and if you did whether you will know what a set is. Now I take it to consist in a doz. of dishes 6 different sizes, 3 doz. of table flat plates and 2 of Soup, 6 pudding dishes, 2 pr. Butter Boats, to which I should like 2 pr. of double flint cut Salts -- all to set my table ""neat and trim"" when dear Collin returns. Perhaps you are  house keeper enough allready to know what is necessary but I fancy you must have been often imposed upon before you got your Learning. They tell me you have purchased a House at  the Hague and some have gone so far as to say you have sent for all your family. I wish you were with your family. I hear Mrs. Jay is unhappy. Is Mrs. A.  [Adams] happy? No. Is Mrs. D.  [Dana] happy? The world say she is, but I believe she would say no. She is younger than Mrs. Adams and does not think it so necessary to domesticate herself critical as the Situation of a Lady is separated from the dear  [illegible]  Protecter of her Life and honour my course  [illegible]   that in every Step I have looked on all sides and steared clear of  [illegible]   nor has she learnt a lesson the World will soon teach her. Thus far I wrote with an intention of sending by the  Amsterdam vessel, but she has given me the slip. I laid by my paper but  I do not know of a present opportunity I feel a new Inducement to write. Dr. Waterhouse yesterday made me a visit. He tell me he has written to you by the late vessel? so it will be unnecessary for me to say any Thing concerning his Situation. The pleasure which I received from his company and conversation was next to that of seeing my dear absent Friend. He has lived in so much  Friendship and intimacy with you, with Mr. T-r  [Thaxter] and my dear Boys, related so many anecdotes, appeard to enter into all your feelings even of the tender domestick kind that he attached me more to him in a few hours than he could otherways have done in half a year, tho his manners are of that frank, open, unreserved kind which is are universally pleasing. He wished me exceedingly to go to you. He was sure it was necessary to your happiness and he could see no prospect of a peace. Even if one took place you certainly was the most suteable Man to reside at  the Hague, the Dutch had a Friendship for you and a confidence in you, you was on every account the best calculated to do essential Service to your country there. Your character was high throughout  Europe, even the tories respected it, but you was not happy abroad. You sighd for domestick tranquility, you longed for the peacefull shades of  Braintree and the kind softning care of Portia. Thus did this gentleman run on whilst I had not a wish to stop the  of his tongue for the sweetest of all praise is that which is given to those we best love. Had my dear Friend been half as earnest with me  to have taken passage with him as this Gentleman has been that I should go with to him, he would have prevaild over my aversion to the Sea. But great as I feel the Sacrifice is I believe he judged best that I should remain where I am. But will you can you think of remaining abroad? Should a peace take place I could not forgive you half a years longer absence. O there are hours, days and weeks when I would not paint to you all my feelings -- for I would not make you more unhappy. I would not  wander from room to room without a Heart and Soul at Home or feel myself deserted, unprotected, unassisted, uncounseld. -- I begin to think there is a moral evil in this Seperation, for when we pledged ourselves to each other did not the holy ceremony close with, ""What God has joined Let no Man put assunder."" Can it be a voluntary seperation? I feel that it is not. "
Sepbr. 3. 1782,"My Dearest Friend If my Letters have been as  as I wish them, you must have heard many times from me since I received a single line from your Hand. This is the sixth time I have written to you; since I received  your last Letters, which were dated in March   . From that time up to this 3d of September not a syllable has come to Hand. A few vague english News paper Reports, respecting a negotiation for a peace. I find your Name mentiond so late as june. Not a vessel has arrived from  Holland since Capt. Deshon. We cannot account for so long a space of times elapsing: since it is said the  United provinces acknowledged the Independance of  America, without receiving any official account of it. The enlargement of the prisoners from  Mill prison, together with the intelligence they brought of the proposed acknowledgment of our , coincideing with the general wish for peace, the specious Letters sent out of  New York by Carleton and Digby about the same time, so facinated all Ranks of people that a General joy pervaded every class; I hardly dared to oppose, to the congratulatory addresses I received upon the occasion, the obstinate persuasion I had; that it was only a tub to the Whale. I ventured to say in some companies, where my unbelief appeared very singular, that  I ardently wished for peace, I could not conceive that an object, of so great Magnitude, could be the Work of a few weeks, or Months; and altho the acknowledgment  of our Independence, was an indispensable preliminary, yet there were many other important articles to be adjusted by the contending powers. I thought it would be better to suspend those warm expressions of joy; which could only be warranted by an assureance that an honorable peace had taken place. If any real foundation existed for such reports, a week or two would give us official assureances of it, and I must beg to suspend my belief untill that period. It really pained me to see the sanguine hopes of my Country perish like the baseless  of a vision. Yet in less than ten days they reflected, and doubted, the elated joy subsided, and they spurned the Idea of a seperate peace. The  arrived in  Boston harbour about a fortnight ago with 13 ships of the Line. His intention is to repair the damaged ships. The two Armies have past an inactive Summer. When when shall I receive any Letters from my dear Friend? Instead of being more and more reconciled to this , every day makes it more painfull to me. Can I with any degree of calmness look Back and reflect that it is near 3 years since we parted, and look forward without seeing, or being in the least able to form an Idea of the period which is still to take place. In  my last Letter  I made you a serious proposal. I will not repeat it at present. If it is accepted one Letter will be sufficient. If it is rejected, one Letter will be too many. We have had a most uncommon Season. Cold and dry -- not one rainy day since the  of June, and very few showers. The drought has been very extensive, and our corn is near all cut of. Scarcly a spire of green Grass is to be seen. The  B-n  [Boston] prisoners have all reachd home except the 3 who were exchanged. There have been 3 of the Number to see me -- to thank me for  writing to you , and to acknowledge your kind attention to them. Beals and the two Clarks have offerd to repay the money you advanced to them; which they say was four pounds sterling a peice, but as I never received a line from you respecting them, or what you had done for them I am at a loss what to do. Some of them are able enough, others are not. I have the very great pleasure to acquaint you that our dear and worthy  is raised in a manner from the dead. His dropsical Symptoms have left him and he has for a month past surprizingly mended. His Cough still continues, but we have great hopes now of his recovery. He is not able to attend to any buisness nor will he be for many months, even tho he should get no relapse. Let me beg you my dear Friend to be particularly attentive to your Health. Do not  so indiscriminately Being with your windows open, it certainly is a bad practise in a country so damp as  Holland. My Notice of this opportunity is so short that I cannot write to Mr. T-r  [Thaxter] or my Son from whom I long to hear.  was well when I last heard from her. She has been at  Newport ever since july. Our Friends are all well and desire to be rememberd. They make great complaints that you do not write to them, and will in Spight of all I can say, think themselves neglected. I feel in my Heart a disposition to complain that when you write, you are so very concise. I am sorry I cannot prevail with you to write by way of  Spain or  France, but you must have reasons to which I am a Stranger. Our  are very studious and attentive to their Books and our daughter thinks of nothing else but making a voyage to her pappa.  "
Sepbr. 5 1782,"My dearest Friend Your kind  of  May 14th  and  June 16th  came to Hand last Evening; and tho I have only just time to acknowledge them, I would not omit a few lines; I have written before by this vessel; which is Bound to  France. Mr. Allen your old fellow traveller is a passenger on Board, and promises to be attentive to the Letters. In my other Letter I mention a serious proposal made in a former; but do not inform you of the Nature of it, fearing a rejection of my proposal and it is of so tender a Nature I could scarcly bear a refusal; yet should a refusal take place, I know it will be upon the best grounds and reasons. But your mention in your two kind favours, your wishes with more seariousness than you have ever before exprest them, I shall leads me again to repeat my request; it is that I may come to you, with our daughter, in the Spring, provided You are like to continue abroad. In my other Letter I have stated to you an arrangement of my affairs, and the person with whom I would chuse to come; I have slightly mentiond it to him; and he says he should like it exceedingly and I believe would adjust his affairs and come with me. Mr. Smith is the person I mean, I mention him least my other Letter should fail. I am the more  to come now I learn Mr. Thaxter is comeing home. I am sure you must feel a still greater want of my attention to you  and I will endeavour to find out the disposition of Congress, but I have lost my intelligence from that Quarter by Mr. Lovels return to this State. I have very little acquaintance with any Gentleman there. Mr. Jackson and Mr. Osgood are the only two Members there from this State. Mr. Lovell has lately returnd. I will see him and make some inquiry; as to peace you have my opinion in the Letter referd to by this vessel. The acknowledgment of our  by the  United provinces is considerd here as a most important Event, but the Newspapers do not anounce it to the world with that Eclat, which would have been rung from all Quarters had this Event been accomplished by a certain character. Indeed we have never received an official account of it untill now. Let me ask you Dear Friend, have you not been rather neglegent in writing to your Friends? Many difficulties you have had to encounter might have been laid open to them, and your character might have had justice done it. But Modest Merrit must be its own Reward. Bolingbrook in his political tracts observes, rather Ironically (but it is a certain fact,) that Ministers stand in as much need of publick writers, as they do of him. He adds, ""in their prosperity they can no more subsist without daily praise, than the writers without daily Bread, and the further the Minister extends his views the more necessary are they to his Support. Let him speak as contemptuously of them as he pleases, yet it will fare with his ambition, as with a lofty Tree, which cannot shoot its Branches  into the Clouds unless its Root work into the dirt."" You make no mention of receiving Letters from me, you certainly must have had some by a vessel which arrived in  France some time before the Fire Brand   Holland. She too had Letters for you. Accept my acknowledgement for the articles sent. As the other arrived safe, I could have wished my little  by the Fire Brand had reachd you before this vessel saild; but no Matter, I can dispose of them. My Luck is great I think. I know not that I have lost any adventure you have ever sent me. Nabby requests in one of her Letters a pair of paste Buckles. When your hand is in you may send a pair for me if you please. Adieu my dearest Friend. Remember that to render your situation more agreable I fear neither the Enemy or old Neptune, but then you must give me full assureance of your intire approbation of my request. I cannot accept a half way invitation. To say I am happy here, I cannot, but it is not an idle curiosity that make me wish to hazard the Watery Element. I much more sincerely wish your return. Could I hope for that during an other year I would endeavour to wait patiently the Event. Once more adieu. The Messenger waits and  me. -- Ever Ever yours,  "
september october 8th 1782,"My dearest Friend Your  of August 17th  is just put into my hands with word that Capt. Grinnel is to sail tomorrow, all of a sudden without having been to see me, or warning me of his going. I made a little excursion to  Haverhill with our daughter and son Charles which prevented my getting my Letters ready. However I am determined not to close my eyes to Night untill I have written to you, and will send Charles of tomorrow morning by sun rise. Mr. Guile is come safe and sends me word he will see me tomorrow or next day. I shall be impatient untill he comes. I want to know all about my dear Friend -- O! that I could add Companion. Permit me my Dearest Friend to renew that Companionship. My Heart sighs for it. I cannot O! I cannot be reconcild to living as I have done for 3 years past. I am searious. I could be importunate with you. May I? Will you let me try to soften, if I cannot wholy releave you, from your Burden of Cares and perplexities? Shall others for their pleasure hazard, what I cannot have courage to incounter from an affection pure as ever burned in a vestal Heart -- Warm and permanant as that which glows in your own dear Bosom. I Hardly think of Enemies of terrors and storms. But I resolve with myself, to do as you wish. If I can add to your Happiness, is it not my duty? If I can soften your Cares, is it not my duty? If I can by a tender attention and assiduity prolong your most valuable Life, is it not my duty? And shall I from Female apprehensions of storms of winds, forego all these Calls? Sacrifice them to my personal ease? Alass I have not even that, for wakeing or sleeping I am ever with you. Yet if you do not consent so much is my Heart intent upon it, that your refusal must be couched in very soft terms, and must pledge yourself to return speedily to me. Yet my dear sir when I can conquer the too soft sensibility of my Heart; I feel  you should quit your station untill an Honorable peace is Established, and you have added that to your other Labours. Tis no small satisfaction to me that my country is like to profit so largely by my sacrifices. I doubt not of your Numerous  avocations. Yet when you can get time to write to your Friends here, it is of vast service to you. It sets tongues and pens at work. It informs the people of your attention to their Interests, and our negotiations are extolled and our Services are held up to view. I am unfortunate in not having in my possession a News paper to inclose, in which some person, has done justice to your patience  to your perseverance, and held up as far as was prudent the difficulties you have had to encounter. I hope you are  by my last Letters in some measure from your anxiety about our dear Friend and Brother Cranch. He is recoverd far beyond our expectations; he is for the first time this week attending Court. I am of opinion that his Lungs are affected, and am in terrors for him least he should have a relapse. He owes his Life the doctors say under providence, to the incessant, unwearied, indefatigable watchfull care of his wife; who has almost sacrificed her own, to save his Life. -- O! my dear Friend, how often is my Heart torn with the idea, that I have it not in my power, let sickness or misfortune assail you thus to watch round your Bed and soften your repose. To the Care of a gracious providence I commit you.  went from here this afternoon, and desires her kind Regards to you. Uncle Q-y  [Quincy] send his Love, is always attentive to hear from you. He applied to me a little while ago, to send for a yards of green velvet proper for a pulpit cushing with fring and tassels for it or half a pound of green sewing silk. He would have sent the Money, but I refused it, because I knew it would give you pleasure to make this little present to our Church. You will be so good as to order it put up by the next conveyance. The Fire Brand is not yet arrived. We are under apprehension for her. We have a large French Fleet in our Harbour, yet are daily insulted by British cruizers. There are several officers who belong to the Fleet who hire rooms in the Town, some of them Men of learning and Character. Several of them have got introduced to me. I treat them with civility, but rather avoid a large acquaintance. I have been on Board one 84 gun ship by the particular invitation of the Captain. Col. Quincy and family accompanied me. This afternoon a Sweed, in the French Service made me a second visit. He speaks english, is a Man of learning and is second in command of the America; which is given by Congress in lieu of the ship which was lost in comeing into the Harbour. These Gentry take a good deal of pains to get an introduction here; seem to consider an acquaintance of much more importance to them, than the people who call themselves geenteel, and who compose our Beau Mond, but who have chiefly risen into Notice since you left the Country. As I have not sought their acquaintance, nor ever appeard in publick since your absence. I am have not the Honour to be known to many of them -- consequently am forgotten or unnoticed  by them in all their publick entertainments. Our Allies however recollect that the only Gentleman who is employed in abroad in publick Service from this state May probably have a Lady and a daughter, and it may be proper to notice them out of Regard to the Gentlemans publick Character; and accordingly Send out their invitations which I decline and send the daughter. This has been repeatedly the case. I care not a stiver as it respects my own country. Mrs. D-a  [Dana] is treated in the same Manner, but people who are accustomed to politeness and good Manners notice it. The Manners of our Country are so intirely changed from what they were in those days of simplicity when you knew it, that it has nothing of a Republick but the Name. Unless you can keep a publick table and Equipage you are but of very small consideration. What would You have thought 15 years ago, for young  at the Bar to be setting up their Chariots, to be purchaseing -- not paying for -- their country seats. P. M-n, B-n H-n, riding in their Chariots who were clerks in offices when we removed from Town. Hogarth may exhibit his world topsa turva. I am sure I have seen it realized.  has been writing to you. Indeed my dear sir you would be proud of her. Not  [that] she is like her Mamma. She has a Stateliness in her manners which some misconstrue into pride and haughtyness, but which rather results from a too great reserve; she wants more affability, but she has prudence and discretion beyond her years. She is in her person tall large and Majestick, mammas partialiaty allows her to be a good figure. Her sensibility is not yet sufficiently awakend to give her Manners that pleasing softness which attracts whilst it is attracted. Her Manners rather forbid all kinds of Intimacy; and awe whilst they command. Indeed she is not like . Had not her Mamma at her age too much sensibility, to be very prudent. It however won a Heart of as much sensibility -- but how my pen runs. I never can write you a short Letter. My Charles and Tommy, are fine Boys. My absent one is not forgotten. How does he, I do not hear from him. Adieu my dear Friend. How much happier should I be to fold you to my Bosom, than to bid you this Languid adieu, with a whole ocean between us. Yet whilst I recall to your mind tender scenes  of happier days, I would add a supplication that the day May not be far distant, that shall again renew them to your 1  of white blond Lace 2 pr  Moroco Shoes for Nabby 4 yd Book Muslin thread for working Muslin 6 pr Black Worsted Breaches patterns. This is written in so much haste that I cannot revise. I took  Letter to inclose and found I was mistaken. That it is to Mr. Thaxter instead of papa. So I will recall some of my observations about sensibility.  "
October 25 1782,"My Dearest Friend The family are all retired to rest, the Busy scenes of the day are over, a day which I wished to have devoted in a particular manner to my dearest Friend, but company falling in prevented nor could I claim a moment  this silent watch of the Night. Look -- (is there a dearer Name than Friend; think of it for me;) Look to the date of this Letter -- and tell me, what are the thoughts which arise in your mind? Do you not recollect that Eighteen years have run their  Circuit, since we pledged our mutual Faith to each other, and the Hymeneal torch was Lighted at the Alter of Love. Yet, yet it Burns with unabating fervour, old ocean has not Quenched it, nor old Time smootherd it, in the Bosom of Portia. It cheers her in the Lonely Hour, it comforts her even in the gloom which sometimes possessess her mind. It is my Friend from the Remembrance of the joys I have lost that the arrow of affliction is pointed. I recollect the untitled Man to whom I gave my Heart, and in the agony of recollection when time and distance present  together, wish he had never been any other. Who shall give me back Time? Who shall compensate to me those years I cannot recall? How dearly have I paid for a titled Husband; should I wish you less wise, that I might enjoy more happiness? I cannot find that in my Heart. Yet providence has wisely placed the real Blessings of Life within the reach of moderate abilities, and he who is wiser than his Neighbour sees so much more to pitty and Lament, that I doubt whether the balance of happiness is in his Scale. I feel a disposition to Quarrel with a race of Beings who have cut me of, in the midst of my days from the only Society I delighted in. Yet  No Man liveth for himself, says an authority I will not dispute. Let  draw satisfaction from this Source  and instead of murmuring and repineing at my Lot consider it in a more pleasing view. Let me suppose that the same Gracious Being who first smiled upon our union and Blessed us in each other, endowed him my Friend with powers and talents for the Benifit of Mankind and gave him a willing mind, to improve them for the service of his Country You have  honour and Reputation at Home and abroad. O may not an inglorious Peace wither the Laurels you have won.  I wrote you  per Capt. Grinnel. The Fire Brand is in great haste to return, and I fear will not give me time to say half I wish. I want you to say many more things to me than you do, but you write so wise so like a minister of state. I know your Embarassments. Thus again I pay for titles. Life takes its complexion from inferiour things; it is little attentions and assiduities that sweeten the Bitter draught and smooth the Rugged Road. I have repeatedly  my desire to make a part of your Family.  ""But will you come and see me""  cannot be taken in that serious Light I should chuse to consider an invitation from those I Love. I do not doubt but that you would be glad to see me; but I know you are apprehensive of dangers and fatigues. I know your Situation may be unsettled -- and it may be more permanant than I wish it. Only think how the word 3 and 4 and 5 years absence sounds!! It sinks into my Heart with a Weight I cannot express. Do you look like the Minature you sent? I cannot think so. But you have a better likeness I am told. Is that designd for me? Gracious Heaven restore to me the original and I care not who has the shadow. We are hoping for the fall of  Gibralter, because we imagine that will facilitate a peace -- and who is not weary of the war? The appointment of  to the Sweedish Court is considerd as a curious step, especially at his own Instances Tis probable others will write you more particularly (the French Fleet still remain with us and the British cruizers insult them -- more American vessels have  been captured since they have lain here than for a year before  [)]. The Generall Green is taken and carried into  Halifax, by which I suppose I have lost some Small Bundles or packages. Beals told me that you gave him 7 small packages which he deliverd Capt. Bacon for me. The prisoners have all arrived except Savil who is yet in  France. I mentiond to you before; that some of them had been with me, and offerd to repay the money with which you supplied them. I could only tell them that I had never received a line from you concerning the Matter, that I chose first to hear from you: I would not receive a farthing unless I had your express direction and your Hand writing to prove that what you had done was from your private purse -- which I was confident was the case; or you would have been as ready to have relieved others if you had any publick fund for that purpose as those which belonged to this Town. I found a story prevailing that what you had done, was at the publick expence; this took its rise either from Ignorance or ingratitude -- but it fully determined me to receive your direction. The persons who have been with me are the two Clarks, the two Bealses and Jobe Feild. I have a cousin in  England for whom his good Mother is greatly distresst, she wishes me to write to you concerning him, if you should find by way of C. S-r  [Storer] that he is needy and should supply him with 5, 6 or 10 Guineys, they will be repaid to me upon your noticeing it. I have been  Virmont Mad I suppose you will say. I own I have straitned myself in concequence of it -- but I expect they will be fine Farms for my children or Grand children or great Grand children. If you send me any thing per the return of the Fire Brand, pray Let an attest come that nothing is British every thing is unBritish. I believe I will inclose a small invoice of proper articles. [Such an invoice has not been found.]  Adieu my dear Friend.  Ever Ever Yours   [Endorsement -- see page image]  "
November 13 1782,"My dearest Friend I have lived to see the close of the third year of our . This is a Melancholy Anniversary to me; and many tender Scenes arise in my Mind upon the recollecttion. I feel unable to sustain even the Idea, that it will be half that period e'er we meet again. Life is too short to have the dearest of its enjoyments . The Social feelings grow Callous by disuse and lose that pliancy of affection which Sweetens the cup of Life as we drink it. The Rational pleasures of Friendship and Society, and the still more refined sensations to which delicate minds only are susceptable like the tender Blosom when the rude Nothern Blasts assail them shrink within collect themselves together, deprived of the all chearing and Beamy influence of the Sun. The Blosom falls, and the fruit withers and decays -- but here the similitude fails -- for tho lost for the present -- the Season returns; the Tree vegetates anew; and the Blossom again puts forth. But  with me; those days which are past, are gone forever: and time is hastning on that period, when I must fall, to rise no more; untill Mortality shall put on immortality, and we shall meet again, pure and unimbodied Spirits. Could we live to the age of the Antediluvians we might better support this seperation, but when three score Years and ten circumscribe the Life of Man, how painfull is the Idea, that of that short space only a few years of social happiness are our allotted portion. Perhaps I make you unhappy. No you will enter with a soothing tenderness  into my feelings; I see in your Eyes the Emotions of your Heart, and hear the sigh that is wafted across the  Atlantick to the Bosom of Portia. But the philosopher and the statesman stiffels these Emotions, and regains a firmness which arrests my pen from my Hand. I last evening received a line from  Boston, to hasten my Letter down or I should again lose an opportunity of conveyance. I was most unfortunate by the Fire Brands sailing and leaving all my Letters behind. A storm prevented my sending the day appointed, and she  by sun rise the Next morning. Tho my Letters were in town by nine o clock they missd. I know if she arrives how dissapointed you will feel. I received from  France per the Alxander  yours bearing no date , but by the contents written about the same time, with those I received per Mr. Guild. Shall I return the compliment, and tell you in a poeticall Stile No give me the Man I love. You are neither of an age or temper to be allured with the  of a Court -- or the Smiles of princessess. I never sufferd an uneasy sensation on that account. I know I have a Right to your whole Heart, because my own  never knew an other Lord -- and such is my confidence in you that if you was not withheld by the strongest of all obligations those of a moral Nature, your Honour would not suffer you to abuse my confidence. But whither am I rambling? We have not any thing in the political way worth . The Fleet of our Allies still remains with us. Our Friend  is chosen Member of C-s  [Congress]. I should be loth he should for the 3d time refuse as it leaves impression upon the minds of our good Citizens no ways to his advantage. But this good Man is some how or other embitterd. His Lady opposes if not by words, by that which has as strong an influence. Who is there left that will sacrifice as others have done?  I think stands alone, alone alass! in more senses than one. This vessel will convey to you the packets designd for the Fire Brand. I hope unimportant as they are, they will not be lost. Shall I close here without a word of my voyage? I believe it is best to wait a reply before I say any  further. Our Friends desire me to remember them to you. Your daughter your Image your Superscription desires to be affectionately rememberd to you. O! how many of the sweet domestick joys do you lose by this Seperation from your Family. I have the satisfaction of seeing my children thus far in life behaveing with credit and honour. God grant  the pleasing prospect may never meet with an alloy and return to me the dear partner of my early years Rewarded for his past sacrifices by the consciousness of having been extensively usefull, not having lived to himself alone, and may the approveing voice of his Country crown his later days in peacefull retirement in the affectionate Bosom of  "
December 23. 1782,"My dearest Friend I have  writing by the last opportunity to  Holland; because I had but small Faith in the designs of the owners or passengers. The vessel sails from  Nantucket, Dr. Winship is a passenger, a Mr. Gray and some others -- and I had just written you so largely by a vessel bound to  France, the General Galvaye, that I had nothing New to say. There are few occurences in this Northen climate at this Season of the year to divert or entertain you -- and in the domestick way should I draw you the picture of my Heart, it would be what I hope you still would Love; tho it containd nothing New; the early possession you obtained there; and the absolute power you have ever mantaind over it; leaves not the smallest space unoccupied. I look back to the early days of our acquaintance; and Friendship, as to the days of Love and Innocence; and with an undiscribable pleasure I have seen near a score of years roll over our Heads, with an affection heightned and improved by time -- nor have the dreary years of absence in the smallest degree effaced from my mind the Image of the dear untittled man to whom I gave my Heart. I cannot sometimes refrain considering the Honours with which he is invested as badges of my unhappiness. The unbounded confidence I have in your attachment to me, and the dear pledges of our affection, has soothed the solitary hour, and renderd your absence more supportable; for had I have loved you with the same affection, it must have been misiry to have doubted. Yet a cruel world too often injures my feelings, by wondering how a person possesst of domestick attachments can sacrifice them by absenting himself for years. If you had known said a person to me the other day; that  would have remained so long abroad; would you have consented that he should have gone? I recollected myself a moment, and then spoke the real dictates of my Heart. If I had known Sir that Mr. A. could have affected what he has done; I would not only have submitted to the absence I have endured; painfull as it has been; but I would not have opposed it, even tho 3 years more should be added to the Number, which Heaven avert! I feel a pleasure in being able to sacrifice my selfish passions to the general good, and in imitating the example which has taught me to consider myself and family, but as the small dust of the balance when compaired with the great community.  most sincerely regreets your absence, she sees me support it, yet thinks she could not imitate either parent in the disinterested motives which actuate them. She has had a strong desire to encounter the dangers of the sea to visit you. I however am not without a suspicion that she may loose her realish for a voyage by spring. The tranquility of mine and my dear sisters family is in a great measure restored to us, since the recovery of our worthy Friend and Brother. We had a most melancholy summer. The young folks of the two families together with those of Col. Q-ys  [Quincy] and General W-n  [Warren] preserve a great Intimacy, and as they wish for but few connections in the Beau Mond, it is not to be wonderd at that they are fond of each others company. We have an agreable young Gentleman by the Name of Robbins who keeps our little school, son to the Revd. Mr. 
 Robbins of  Plimouth. And we have in the little circle an other gentleman who has opend an office in Town, for about nine months past, and boarded in Mr. Cranch family. His Father you knew. His Name is Tyler, he studied Law upon his comeing out of colledge with Mr. Dana, but when Mr. Dana went to congress he finished his studies with Mr. Angers. Loosing his Father young and having a very pretty patrimony left him, inheriting possessing a sprightly fancy a warm imagination and an agreable person, he was rather negligent in persueing his buisness in the way of his profession; and dissipated two or 3 years of his Life and too much of his fortune for to reflect upon with pleasure; all of which he now laments but cannot recall. At 23 the time when he took the resolution of comeing to  B-n  [Boston] and withdrawing from a too numerous acquaintance; he resolved to persue his studies; and his Buisness; and save his remaining fortune which sufferd much more from the paper currency than any other cause; so that out of 17 thousand pounds which fell to his share; he cannot now realize more than half that sum; as he told me a few days past. His Mamma is in possession of a large Estate and he is a very favorite child. When he proposed comeing to settle here he met with but little encouragement, but he was determined upon the trial. He has succeeded beyond expectation, he has popular talants, and as his behaviour has been unexceptionable since he has been his residence in Town; in concequence of which his Buisness daily increases -- he cannot fail making a distinguished figure in his profession if he steadily persues it. I am not acquainted with any young Gentleman whose attainments in literature are equal to his, who judges with greater accuracy or discovers a more delicate and refined taste. I have frequently looked upon him with the Idea that You would have taken much pleasure in such a pupil. I wish I was as well assured that you would be equally pleased with him in an other character, for such I apprehend are his distant hopes. I early saw that he was possest with powerfull attractions, and as he obtaind and deserved, I believe the character of a gay; tho not a criminal youth, I thought it prudent to keep as great a reserve as possible. In this I was seconded by the discreet conduct of a daughter, who is happy in not possessing all her Mothers sensibility. Yet I see a growing attachment in him stimulated by that very reserve. I feel the want of your presence and advise. I think I know your sentiments so well that that the merit of a gentleman will be your first consideration, and I have made every inquiry which I could with decency; and without discloseing my motives. Even in his most dissipated state he always applied his mornings to study; by which means he has stored his mind with a fund of usefull knowledge. I know not a young fellow upon the stage whose language is so pure -- or whose natural disposition is more agreable. His days are devoted to his office, his Evenings of late to my fire side. His attachment is too obvious to escape notice. I do not think the Lady wholy indifferent; yet her reserve and apparent coldness is such that I know he is in misirable doubt. Some conversation one Evening of late took place which led me to write him a Billets and tell him, that at least 
Page 3
 it admitted a possibility that I might quit this country in the Spring; that I never would go abroad without my daughter, and if I did go, I wished to carry her with a mind unattached, besides I could have but one voice; and for that I held myself accountable to you; that he was not yet Established in Buisness sufficient to think of a connection with any one; to which I received this answer Madam I have made an exertion to answer your Billet. I can only say that the second impulse in my Breast is my Love and respect for you; and it is the foible of my nature to be the machine of those I Love and venerate. Do with me as seemeth good unto thee. I can safely trust my dearest fondest wishes and  in the hands of a Friend that can feel, that knows my situation and her designs. If reason pleads against me, you will do well to hestitate. If Friendship and reason unite I shall be happy -- only say I shall be happy when I deserve; and it shall be my every exertion to ag augment augment my merit, and this you may be assured of, whether I am blessed in my wishes or not, I will endeavour to be a character that you shall not Blush once to have entertaind an Esteem for. What ought I to say? I feel too powerful a pleader within my own heart and too well recollect the Love I bore to the object of my early affections to forbid him to hope. I feel a regard for him upon an account you will smile at, I fancy I see in him Sentiments opinions and actions which endeared to me the best of Friends. Suffer me to draw you from the depths of  to endearing family scenes. I know you cannot fail being peculiarly interested in the present. I inclose you a little paper which tho trifling in itself, may serve to shew you the truth of my observations. The other day the gentleman I have been speaking of; had a difficult writ to draw. He requested the favour of looking into your Book of forms, which I readily granted; in the Evening when he returned me the key he put in to my hands a paper which I could not tell what to make of; untill he exclaimed ""O! Madam Madam, I have new hopes that I shall one day become worthy your regard. What a picture have I caught of my own Heart, my resolutions, my designs! I could not refrain breaking out into a Rhapsody. I found this coppy of a Letter in a pamphlet with observations upon the study of the Law and many excellent remarks; you will I hope forgive the theft, when I deliver the paper to you; and you find how much benifit I shall derive from it."" I daily see that he will win the affections of  who has as much dignity as a princess. She is handsome, but not Beautifull. No air of levity ever accompanies either her words or actions. Should she be caught  by a tender passion, sufficient to remove a little of her natural reserve and soften her form and manners, she will be a still more pleasing character. Her mind is daily improveing, and she gathers new taste for literature perhaps for its appearing in a more pleasing form to her. If I can procure a little ode which accompanied an ice Heart I will inclose it to you. It is now my dear Friend a long long time since I had a line from you. The Fate of  Gibralter leads me to fear that a peace is far distant, and that I shall not see you -- God only knows when; I shall say little about my former request, not that my desire is less, but before this can reach you  probable I may receive your opinion. If in favour of my comeing to you; I shall have no occasion to urge it further, if against it, I would not embarrass you; by again requesting it. I will endeavour to set down and consider it as the portion alloted me. My dear sons are well their application and improvements go hand in hand. Our Friends all desire to be rememberd. The Fleet of our allies expect to sail daily but where destined we know not; a great harmony has subsisted between them and the Americans ever since their residence here. I wish to write to Mr. T-r  [Thaxter] but fear I shall not have time. Mrs. D-a  [Dana] and children are well. The judge has been very sick of a fever but I believe is better. This Letter is to go by the Iris which sails with the Fleet. I hope it will reach you in safety. If it should fall into the hands of an Enemy, I hope they will be kind enough to distroy it; as I would not wish to see such a family picture in print; adieu my dear Friend. Why is it that I hear so seldom from my dear John; but one Letter have I ever received from him since he arrived in  Petersburgh? I wrote him by the last oppertunity. Ever remember me as I do you; with all the tenderness which it is possible for one object to feel for an other; which no time can obliterate no distance alter, but which is always the same in the Bosom of  Portia   "
"
December 30 1782[Endorsement -- see page image]
","My dearest Friend  I wrote you a very long Letter no longer ago than this day week; which went under convoy of the French Fleet, I cannot omit any opportunity which presents of telling you what I know always makes you happy -- that I am well that our children are so, and the rest of our Friends. Uninteresting as this is to the rest of the World; it is sweet musick to those who Love and are beloved. I know nothing which could make me happier than such an assureance from you; which I daily hope and pray for. It is now a long time since I heard from you; the Fate of  Gibralter is determined so much against my hopes that I now  of a speedy peace; and the Idea of seeing you is, blended with so many vissisitudes and events, with such a contingency of circumstances that I lose sight of you in the throng. I feel in a state of suspence -- and am at a loss for your determination with regard to comeing to you. I am determined to be content whatever it may be, because I know it will be the result of Love; and affection. In my last I wrote you many domestick occurrences. I hope you will receive it. Some of them I feel too much Interested in, wholy to omit here. In that I mentiond to you that I was apprehensive there was a connection forming in our family, and that I felt at a loss how to conduct in it. There is setled in this Town a young Gentleman whose Father and family you knew. He was too young when you resided here to be known to you. His Name is Tyler. He studied Law with Mr. Dana upon his comeing out of colledge, but upon Mr. Danas going to  congress he finished his studies with Mr. Anger. His Father died when he was a minor and left him, or there rather fell to him a handsome Estate, his Father dieing without a will and his mother insisting upon the elder Brothers giving up his right by Birth to a double portion; the Estate was equally divided. His Mother has in possession a handsome paternal Estate which fell to her by her Father. I believe she did not injure herself by her second connection. But his patrimony as he often expresses it has been his Bane, for with a disposition naturally volatile and gay; an easy address, an agreable person he became the favorite of the Gay and Fair -- and dissipated that time which he should have employed in distinguishing himself in his profession; in a round of pleasure and amusements; yet not withstanding all these temptations and allurement to vice, the world accuse him not of more than Gayety and volatility. His improvements in knowledge and literature shew that he has applied a considerable share of his time to study. About 18 months ago he made an excursion to  Falmouth with an intention of setling there, but his ambition and Genious could not brook a retirement like that, and he returnd and was advised by his Friends to make trial of this Town for his residence. He accordingly came, askd the opinion of the principal families here; who could not give him much encouragement. He applied to Mr. Cranch for lodgings and office, both of which he obtained there; and has conducted with great steadiness and application ever since he has resided there. Possesst with popular talants he has gained the Esteem and Buisness of the Town, which is daily encreasing. 
Page 3
 If he is steady he will shine in his profession. His disposition appears exceedingly amiable -- his attractions perhaps too powerfull even to a young Lady possesst with as much apparent coldness and indifference as ever you saw in one character, and with such a reserve as has many a time awed to the greatest distance the least approach towards her. I cannot however help noticeing the very particular attention and regard of this Gentleman towards her, and that it daily becomes more pleasing to her. I have been more particular in my Letter which I hope you will receive before this as it went a week ago; I there  that he had opend his mind to me; declared his attachment, but asked for my countanence no further than he should in future merit it. He has in some measure laid a state of his affairs before me. His interest sufferd to an amazeing degree by the paper currency -- and he foolishly squanderd too much of it away during the thoughtless part of his life. He is trying to purchase a Farm in Town, he meant to have purchased Mr. Borlands if it had been sold -- but I rather think it will not. If he should obtain the regard of the Lady he wishes for, I suppose he would think himself authorized to address you; but at present he is in a state of suspence. I mentiond in my last that I would inclose a little poetick Scrap which attended a Heat of Ice one very cold morning this winter, and which accidentially fell into my hand; I asked him for a copy, after some hesitation he complied without an Idea of what I meant to do with it. Possibly it may draw you a moment from the depths of politicks to  family Scenes, where I feel the want more than ever of your advise and direction. Merit I know will ever be the first consideration with you. This Gentleman well knows that he has no fortune to expect here, should he be admitted to a connection. My Letter is calld for. In haste I must conclude it with the constant assureance of my most affectionate regard.  Yours ever Ever yours.  "
Janry l0th 1783.,"My dearest Friend  who is the Bearer of this has acted for about 7 months in the capacity of preceptor to our children; I have mentiond him to you in former Letters, he is the son of the Revd Mr. Robbins of  Plimouth, a Modest worthy Youth; under whose care our children improved greatly, which makes us very loth to part with him; but an opportunity presenting greatly to his advantage we could not press his tarrying longer with us. A Mr. Mitchel and family are going to  Bordeaux to Establish an American House there; and have taken this Gentleman into their family, his Mamma being a near relation to Mr. Mitchels Lady; if you should chance to see this young Gentleman, or it should any way be in your power to serve and assist him, you would particularly oblige me by doing it, his merit will entitle him to your notice; and the particular attention he paid to our children whilst he acted as their preceptor, calls for my acknowledgment. I am impatient for intelligence from you; by a Letter which Mr. Storer received from  dated at  Paris, which came in the Julius Caesar, I had the pleasure of hearing that you were well, and at Paris; I need not say how greatly this pleasure would have been enhanced if I had received this intelligence from your own hand; I would fain flatter myself from your going there; that Some Ideas of a negotiation were taking place; but whether they will produce the desired object Time only can determine. Could I look forward to any given period, when I might hope again to embrace my dearest Friend in his Native Land, it would serve to mitigate the painfull absence. I have submitted to it with a meritorious patience, and hope the reward in safety and happiness to my country. With Sophonisba I can say, can rejoice to behold you in the character of citizen and patriot,  your private affections to the Publick Benifit. I will not examine how much of enthusiasm there is in this flight. It is the 10 of  a most voilent snow storm -- our family in Health, seated at this moment round a cheefull fire side, illumined   by the presence of a daughter who is the portrait of her dear Father, two sprightly Sons and a pretty Niece compose the present circle. In addition to these our winter Evenings are enlivened by the company and conversation of a gentlman who is a very frequent visiter here; and whom I have mentiond largely to you in two late Letters -- a Gentleman who has resided in Town about nine Months, who Boards in Mr. Cranchs family, and is a practitioner of Law; his Name is Tyler, his Father you knew. But what does all this mean, you will naturally ask, if you have not received my other Letters? It means that I see, what I believe scarcly believe in my power to prevent without doing violence to Hearts which I hope are honest and good. It means that I wish for your advise and counsel. I will say no more at present, but trust that you have received my other Letters. Adieu my Dearest Friend, heaven grant me good and speedy News from you; this  Storm I fear has cast away vessels which we hourly look for. My dear John, my heart aches when I think how seldom I hear from him; pray direct him to write to me, he is either very neglegent or I very unfortunate. I hope his conduct is such as his patron approves, and will ever be good and virtuous. The little social circle around me, who are all variously employed, Sewing, reading; Studying  &c. jointly and severally present their duty and affection. Pappa is often very often the subject of conversation, and Mamma is never so highly delighted, as when she can lay down to them Some excellent precept, and example, which she recollects from his writings, or his Lips. But she cannot make them enter into the Idea of his quitting his Native Land, and relinquishing all his domestick pleasures for the publick Service, yet relinquished as they are for a time, may they never Suffer any diminution by absence; but may they ever rise to your view as the objects of all others the dearest to you, and for which no foreign pleasure or amusement can compensate. Heaven Grant the day may not be far distant when you may realize all your Heart wishes, in the fond embraces of your children, and in the Reciprocal endearments  of your ever Ever affectionate  "
April 7 1783,"My dearest Friend Tis a long a very long time since I had an opportunity of conveying a single line to you. I have upon many accounts been impatient to do it. I now most sincerely rejoice in the great and important event which sheaths the Hostile Sword and, gives a pleasing presage that our spears may become prunning hooks; that the Lust of Man is restrained, or the powers and revenues of kingdoms become inadequate to the purposes of . I have had the good fortune to receive several Letters from you of late; I thank you for them; they are always too short, but I do not complain knowing the thousand avocations you must have upon your mind and Hands. Yours of December 4th, gave me the highest pleasure. are Ideas that have taken full possession of my Heart and mind. I had much rather see you in America, than Europe. I well know that real true and substantial happiness depend not upon titles Rank and fortune; the Gay coach, the Brilliant attire; the pomp and  of Courts; rob, the mind of that placid harmony, that social intercourse which is an Enemy to ceremony. My Ambition, my happiness centers in him; who sighs for domestick enjoyments, amidst all the world calls happiness -- who partakes not in the jovial Feast; or joins the Luxurious table, without turning his mind to the plain unadulterated food which covers his own frugal Board, and sighs for the Feast of reason and the flow of sense soul.  created perturbations, yet allayed anxiety. ""Your"" Image your ""Superscription, Your Emelia would tell you, if she would venture to write to you upon the subject; that it was not the superficial accomplishments of danceing, singing, and playing; that led her to a favorable  to a favorable opinion of Selim; since she knew him not, when those were his favorite amusements -- nor has he ever been in the practise of either, since his residence in this Town; even the former Beau, has been converted into the plain dressing Man; and the Gay volatile Youth, appears to become the studious Lawyer. Yet certain reasons which I do not chuse to enumerate here, have led me to put a present period, as far as advise and desires would go, to the Idea of a connection, to extirpate it from the Hearts and minds of either is not I apprehend in my power, voilent opposition never yet served a cause of this nature. Whilst they believe me their best Friend, and see that their Interest is near my Heart, and that my opposition is founded upon rational principals, they submit to my prohibition, earnestly wishing for your return, and more prosperous days; as without your approbation, they never can conceive themselves happy. I will be more particular by the first direct conveyance. Mr. Guile who kept  with me, tells me he has a vessel which will sail tomorrow for  Virgina; and from thence to  Europe, yet he knows not for certain to what part, but as this is the only opportunity since December; I would not let it slip. We are all well, our two Sons go on Monday with Billy Cranch to  Haverhill; there to be under the care and tuition of Mr. Shaw who has one in his family which he offers for colledge in july. I have done the best I could with them. They have been without a school ever since janry. I tried Mr. Shutes but could not get them in, he having seven in his family; and four more engaged to him.  Andover was full and so is every other private School. They do not like the thoughts of mammas going a broad, and my little Neice who has lived 5 years with me prays that her uncle may return, and hopes he will not  send her away when he returns comes. This day has been our meeting for the choise of a Governour. The vote in this Town was for Genll. Lincoln. There were proposals of chuseing an absent Man, but I discouraged it wherever I heard it mentiond. We want Be kind enough to let the young Gentlemen who reside with you know, that their Friends are well and that I will do myself the pleasure of answering their Letters by the first vessel which sails from this port.  is to be my Gaurdian and protector if I cross  the Atlantick. He comes whether I do or not. Emelia has spent the winter in  Boston, during that time it has been currently reported that preliminary articles were setled between this gentleman and her. She took no pains to discountanance this report -- but alass her Heart is drawn an other way -- and Mr. S. never entertaind an Idea of the kind.   "
April 28th 1783,"My dearest Friend At length an opportunity offers after a space of near five Months, of again writing to You. Not a vessel from any port in this state has sailed since , by which I could directly convey you a line. I have written twice by way of  Virgina but fear they will never reach you: from you I have lately received several Letters containing the most pleasing intelligence. ""Peace o'er the world her olive Branch extends."" ""Hail! Goddess heavenly bright profuse of joy, and pregnant with delight."" The Garbs of this favorite of  America, is woven of an admirable texture and proves the great skill, wisdom, and abilities, of the Master workmen. It was not fabricated in the Loom of  France, nor are the materials english, but they are the product of our own American soil, raised and Nurtured, not by the gentle showers of Heaven, but by the hard  and indefatigable industery and firmness of her Sons, and water'd by the Blood of many of them. May its duration be in proportion to its value, and like the Mantle of the prophet descend with blessings to generations yet to come. And may you my dearest Friend, return to your much loved solitude with the pleasing reflextion of having contributed to the happiness of Millions. We have not yet received any account of the signings the definitive Treaty, so that no  rejoiceings have taken place as yet. The 5th article in the Treaty has raised the old spirit against the Tories to such a height that it would be at the risk of their lives should they venture here; it may subside after a while, but I Question whether any state in the union will admit them even for 12 Months. What then would have been the concequence if compensation had been granted them? Your journal has afforded me and your Friends much pleasure and amusement. You will learn, perhaps from Congress that the journal, you meant for Mr. Jackson; was by some mistake enclosed to the Minister for foreign affairs; and concequently came before Congress with other  papers. The  Massachussets delegates applied for it, but were refused it. Mr. Jackson was kind enough to wait upon me, and shew me your Letter to him, and the other papers inclosed, and I communicated the journal to him. Mr. Higginson writes that it was moved in congress by Hamilton of Virgina and Wilson of  Pensilvana to censure their ministers, for departing from their duty in not adhering to their instructions, and for giving offence to the Court of  France, by distrusting their Friendship; they however could not carry their point; it was said the instruction alluded was founded upon Reciprocity, and that the C.V.  [Comte de Vergennes] had not acted upon that principal. When these gentry found that it would not be considerd  in the Light in which they wished, they gave out that if no more was said upon that subject, the other would drop. This is all I have been able to collect -- my intelligence is very imperfect since Mr. L-l  [Lovell] left congress. Mr. G-r  [Gerry] I believe is determined to go again. I shall then have a Friend and correspondent who will keep me informed. Upon receiving a Letter from you in which you desire me to come to you should you be longer detained abroad, I took the Liberty of writing to Dr. Lee, requesting him to give me the earliest intelligence respecting the acceptance of your resignation. I do not think it will be accepted, by what I have already learnt; if it should not; I shall still feel undetermined what to do. From many of your Letters I was led to suppose you would not return without permission; yet I do not imagine the bare renewal of a former commission would induce you to tarry. I shall not run the risk unless you are appointed minister at the Court of  Britain. Mr. Smith is waiting for me to hear from congress. He means to go whether I do or not, but if I do he will take charge of every thing respecting my voyage. Our two sons together with Mr. Cranch's, are placed in the family of Mr. Shaw. He had one young gentleman before whom he offers this year for Colledg. I doubt not he will contribute every thing in his power towards their instruction and improvement. I last evening received Letters from them and they appear to be very contented and happy. With Regard to some  affairs which I wrote you about last winter, certain reasons have  [prevented] its their proceeding any further -- and perhaps it will never again be renewed. I wished to have told you so sooner, but it has not been in my power. Our Friends are all well and desire to be affectionately rememberd to you. Where is our son, I hear no more of him than if he was out of the world. You wrote me in yours of December 4th that he was upon his journey to you, but I have never heard of his arrival. Need I add how earnestly I long for the day when Heaven will again bless us in the Society of each other. Whether upon European of American ground is yet in the Book of uncertainty, but to feel  happy and easy, I believe it must be in our own Republican cottage; with the Simplicity which has ever distinguished it -- and your ever affectionate My dearest Friend I last Evening received yours of  18th in which you are explicit with Regard to your return. I shall therefore let Congress renew or create what commission they please, at least wait your further direction tho you should be induced to tarry abroad. I have taken no step as yet with regard to comeing out, except writing to Dr. Lee as mentiond before. Heaven send you safe to your ever affectionate   "
 [April 28th 1783],
May 7th. 1783,"My dearest Friend Yesterday  waited upon me with your favour of Febry 4th. I am sorry you have sufferd so much anxiety with regard to a domestick occurrence, it has been wholy oweing to want of conveyance that you have not much sooner been informd that what you wish, has taken place, that is that it is done with -- and that this determination took place soon after my last Letter to you which was in December. In Jan'ry she went to  Boston and spent the rest of the winter there. It is not that any of those Qualities you justly dread have appeard in this Gentleman Since his residence in this Town. His conduct has been Regular, and his Manners pure -- nor has he discoverd any Love of Gaiety inconsistant even with your Ideas. I say this as it appears to me, to be the Truth, and in justification of my having had a partiality in his favour. The world look back to the days in which I knew him not: and remember him as a Beau and a Gay volatile young fellow, and tho I have never heard any vices asscribed to him, yet I think with Some of my Friends a longer period necessary to Establish a contrary Character. It has therefore been my advise and wish to put an end to the connection. I cannot affirm that it is wholy eradicated from their minds, but time will do it; your daughter has a firmness of mind and a prudence beyond her years. She will not act contrary to the advise of her Friends, and in a particular manner her parents. It is has not been a matter of indifference to either of them. Yet it is now so far laid asside as gives me reason to think it will never again be renewed; he visits here but seldom. When I received   and found your anxiety; it gave me pleasure to think I could tell you; that it was wholy done with. The spirit which rises here against the return of the Refugees is , you can hardly form an Idea of it. I think you are wanted much in your own Country; it must be to continue your Labours, but your Reward must be in a better State, you will Scarcly find Gratitude in this -- loaves and fishes are not for you or yours. As much as has been said with regard to wishing you were here for a certain office, I do not believe it would have been carried against the Golden Calf. Many efforts were made this year to shake his Interest. In this Town it was done; and Genll. Lincoln had the vote, in  Weymouth Mr. Bowdoin, in  Bridgewater Lincoln. But in the  Town of Boston H-k  [Hancock] carried it by a much fuller vote than ever. Some gave this reason why they were full for him this year, (Newburry port,  Andover and some other places), that they chose he should be continued rather than a New one chosen, because they saw a probality of making a better choice an other year and that it would be an affront to leave a Man out who had only served one year  when prehaps they had nothing particular against him. Some person of more activity and firmness is wanted, or our Goverment will become truly contemptable. Since I took my pen a Letter from  has reached me, he writes thus  ""I arrived in  Philadelphia this day 23 of April, and had the Honour of receiving your commands of the 9th. Tho we were exceeding delirious of Mr. Adamses assistance in what yet remains to be done in  Europe, yet his Letters were so pressing, that the Committee to whom they were referrd could not resist reporting in favour of his Resignation. Congress have not yet considerd that Report, but I think Madam you may rly upon it that leave will be given him, as he requests."" I shall accordingly look for you by the middle of summer, and I beg you would not make it late in the year, as this coast you well know is very dangerous in the fall and winter. Heaven preserve and send you safe to this peacefull cottage one more. I enclose a list of a few articles in the family way. I have done with  more. My last adventure from  Holland was most unfortunate. The Length of the passage was such, that the News of peace arrived a few days before; Goods fell and are now sold much below the sterling coast; many are lower than ever I knew them; Some persons are obliged to sell, and I believe the peace, will ruin more merchants and traders than the War. Many solem faces you see in concequence of it. No such rapid fortunes to be acquired now. Taxes heavy, very heavey -- trade stagnated, money scarce. Your daughter request by me 18 yd of white Lutestring, as that is a favorite coulour with her, and my Ladyship asks if she may now be permitted to have 10 yd of crimson English damask for a winter gown, and 18 yd of a light brown sattin, Mouse coulour. Mr. Storer has a good fancy and would purchase them if you give orders. 2 peices of good Irish linnen, ah dear  Ireland, no linnen like yours -- so white so strong &c.  France for Cambrick, so I should like a peice as I expect to close my mercantle affairs with this Letter.  Holland sends us the best tea, and if you take half a dozen pound of Hyson ditto souchong and congo, it may not be amiss -- and a few pounds of spice &c. You will as a housekeeper having many articles which you will bring home -- table linnen &c, which will make it unnecessary for me to write for any.   requesting you to send me a set of china for a dining table, but whether you never received the list' or thought me extravagant I know not. I have never written for any thing but what has past through your hands. I suppose you have a Quantity by you which when you return you will take with you: those articles have been here so very high that I have never purchased any here. Carpets I suppose you have which I wish you not to leave behind. I shall not make any draught if I can dispose of what articles I have yet remaining. The Board and  schooling of our sons runs up, and I have been purchaseing land again, tho not in  Virmont. You recollet a Woods at the foot of the hill which belonged to the Estate of Your uncle Adams and fell to the heirs of his Son. This with 4 acers of pasture was sold and I purchased it, as I felt loth it should go to any person who could not pass to it, but through land of yours. The wood upon the land is estimated at 45 cord. It cost me 2 hundred dollors, the whole is 7 acers. If it should so happen that you should be detained abroad longer than you expect you may make me a little remittance by a carefull hand. I shall not need it if I could dispose of what articles I have without giving them away; or even receive a sum which is due to me for some china which I sent for without Bills. I expected when I was requested to send for it, to have had a Bill for the purpose, but instead of this, 20 Livers Livres which were laid out for me, were charged to me a hundred and 10 pr cent, and I paid to the very person 10 dollors and half for only those 20 livres whilst upon the other side of the account stood 60 dollors worth purchased for them and charged at the Sterling coast for which I have never yet received a Livre. This is the Friendship of the World. I shall take care in future, I have Interest due upon loan office certificates to the amount of 90 dollors, but not a farthing can I get, whilst the Cry for taxes is no otherways appeased than by the payment of them. I have a good mind to grow selfish, but I have such an example of disinterestedness and constant Instances of personal sacrifices, family Sacrifices, pecuniary sacrifices that I shall never have resolution enough nor I hope, meaness of spirit enough to take advantage of the unprotected, the widow or the Fatherless. Adieu company calls. A family society meet here to day. How happy should I bee that you could make one. I would give you a fine Salmon, a pair of roast Brants and a custard, can you dine upon such a Slender number of dishes after having been accustomed to 50 and a hundred. Aya but say you true Friendship, tender affection and mutual Love are to be found there, and that is a feast I meet not with abroad. Come then and join in the Feast of reason and flow of Soul. Come and give happiness to her who know not either solid pleasure or real felicity seperated from you -- and who subscribes most tenderly and affectionatly My Pappa sets by and desires to be  to you, Uncle Q-y  [Quincy] dines here to day, hopes to see you at his House e'er long; Sister Shaw too sends her Love, and you are the subject of all our conversation. Enclosed is a publick paper. You will see you are not forgotten here. The writer is J.Q. Esqr.   "
"Braintree  June 20th 1783
","My Dearest Friend If I was certain I should welcome you to your native Land in the course of the summer, I should not regret Mr. Smiths going abroad without me. Should it be otherways, should you still be detained abroad -- I must submit, satisfied that you judge best, and that you would not subject me to so heavy a , or yourself to so severe a mortification as I flatter myself it would be, but for the general good: a European life would, you say, be the ruin of our Children. If so, I should be as loth as you, to hazard their embibeing sentiments and opinions which might make them unhappy in a sphere of Life which tis probable they must fill, not by indulging in luxuries for which tis more than possible they might contract a taste and inclination, but in studious and labourious persuits. You have before this day, received the joint commission for forming a commercial treaty with  Britain. I am at a loss to determine whether you will consider  so bound by it, as to tarry longer abroad. Perhaps there has been no juncture in the publick affairs of our country; not even in the hour, of our deepest distress, when able statesmen and wise Counsellors were more wanted than at the present day. Peace abroad leaves us at leisure to look into our own domestick affairs. Altho upon an Estimate of our National debt, it appears but as the Small Dust of the balance, when compared to the object we have obtained, and the benifits we have secured, yet the Restless spirit of man will not be restrained; and we have reason to fear that Domestick jars and confusions, will take place, of foreign contentions and devastations. Congress have commuted with the Army by engageing to them 5 years pay, in lieu of half pay for Life. With Security for this they will disband contented. But our wise Legislators are about disputing the power of Congress to do either; without considering their hands in the mouth of the Lion, and if the just and necessary food is not supplied, the outragious animal may become so ferocious as to spread horrour, and devastation, or another Theseus may arise who by his reputation, and exploits of valour, whose personal character and universal popularity, may distroy our Amphictinik system and subjugate our infant republicks to Monarchical domination. Our House of Representitives is this Year composed of more than a hundred New Members, some of whom no doubt are good Men. Near all the able and  Members who composed the last House have lost their Seats, by voting for the return of Mr. Brattle; notwithstanding the strongest evidence in his favour, and the many proofs which were produced of his Friendly conduct towards  America. For this crime, our worthy Friend Mr. Cranch was droped by this Towns The Senate is a loser this year by the resignation of some excellent Members. We have in this state an impost of 5 per cent, and an excise act, whilst the Neighbouring states  have neither. Foreigners finding this the case, cary their Cargoes to other states. At this the Merchant grumbles, the Farmer groans with his taxes, and the Mechanick for want of employ. Heaven Avert that like the Greek Republicks we should by civil discension weaken our power, and crush our rising greatness; that the Blood of our citizens, should be shed in vain: and the labour, and toil, of our statesmen; be finally bafled; through niggardly parsimony; Lavish prodigality; or Ignorance of our real Interest. We want a Soloman in wisdom, to guide and conduct this great people: at this critical acre, when the counsels which are taken, and the measures which are persued; will mark our future Character either with honour, and Fame, or disgrace, and infamy; in adversity, we have conducted with prudence and magninimity. Heaven forbid, that we should grow giddy with prosperity, or the height to which we have soared, render a fall conspicuously fatal. Thus far I had written when your welcome  of March 28th reached me; I was not dissapointed in finding you uncertain with regard to the Time of your return; should the appointment which I fear; and you have hinted at; take place, it would indeed be a dull day to me. I have not a wish to join in a scene of Life so different from that in which I have been educated; and in which my early and I must suppose, happier days, have been Spent; curiosity satisfied and I should sigh for tranquil Scenes, Well  home is my chief delight, and the affectionate domestick wife with the Relative duties which accompany that character my highest ambition. It was the disinterested wish of sacrificeing my personal feelings to the publick utility, which first led me to think of unprotectedly hazarding a voyage. I say unprotectedly for so I consider every lady who is not accompanied by her Husband. This objection could only be surmounted by the earnest wish I had to soften those toils which were not to be dispenced with, and if the publick welfare required your Labours and exertions abroad, I flatterd myself that if I could be with you, it might be in my power to contribute to your happiness and pleasure, but the day is now arrived, when with honour and well earned Fame, you may return to your native land -- when I cannot any longer consider it as my duty to submit to a further Seperation, and when it appears necessary that those abilities which have crownd you with Laurels abroad, should be exerted at home for the publick Safety. I do not wish you to accept an Embassy to  England, should you be appointed. This little Cottage has more Heart felt Satisfaction for you than the most Brilliant Court can afford, the pure and undiminished tenderness of  Love, the filial affection of a daughter who will never act contrary to the advise of a Father, or give pain to the Maternal Heart. Be assured that she will never make a choice without your approbation which I know she considers as Essential to her happiness. That she has a partiality I know, and believe, but that she has submitted her opinion to the advise of her Friends, and relinquished the idea of a connection upon principals of prudence and duty, I can with equal truth assure you. Yet nothing unbecomeing the Character which I first entertaind has ever appeard in this young Gentleman since his residence in this Town, and he now visits in this family with the freedom of an acquaintance, tho not with the intimacy of a nearer connection. It was the request of Emelia who has conducted with the greatest prudence, that she might be permitted to see and treat this Gentleman as an acquaintance whom she valued. ""Why said she should I treat a Gentleman who has done nothing to forfeit my Esteem, with neglect or contempt, merely because the world have said, that he entertained a preferable regard for me? If his foibles are to be treated with more severity than the vices of others, and I submit my judgment and opinion to the disapprobation of others in a point which so nearly concerns me, I wish to be left at liberty to act in other respects with becomeing decency."" And she does and has conducted so as to meet with the approbation of all her Friends. She has conquerd herself. An extract from a little poetick peice which Some months ago fell into my Hands may give you some Idea of the Situation of this Matter. You will tell me you do not want a poet, but if there is a mind otherways well furnished, you would have no objection to its being a mere amusement. You ask me if this Gentleman is a speaker at the Bar. He attends  Plimouth Court and has spoke there. He is not yet sworn in to the  Superiour Court, but is proposed to be sworn in the Next court, with his cotemporaries. I cannot say what he will make, but those who most intimately know him, say he has talants to make what he pleases, and fluency to become a good Speaker. His buisness encreases here, and I know nothing  but what he is well esteemed. His temper and disposition appear to be good. The family in which he boards find no fault with his conduct. He is Regular in his liveing, keeps no company with Gay companions, seeks no amusement but in the society of two or 3 families in Town, never goes to  Boston but when Buisness calls him there. If he has been the Gay thoughtless young fellow which he is said to have been and which I believe he was, he has at least practised one year of reformation. Many more will be necessary to Establish him in the world, whether he will make the man of worth and steadiness time must determine.  are placed under the care, and in the family of Mr. Shaw. They have been near 3 months absent from me. This week with my daughter and Mr. Smith to accompany us I go to see them. My dear John, where is he? I long to see him. I have been very anxious about him. Such a winter journey. I hope he is with you. I want to receive a Letter from him. If you should continue abroad untill fall I should be glad you would make me a small remittance, goods will not answer. We are glutted with them. I do not wish for any thing more, than I want for my family use. In this way a few peices of Irish linnen and a peice of  Russia sheeting together with 2 green silk umbrellas I should be glad of as soon as convenient. If you should have an opportunity from  France to send me 3 Marsels cotton and silk quilts I should be very glad; they are like the jacket patterns you sent me by Charles. I want a white, a Blew and a pink. Mr. Dana sent 3 to Mrs. Dana; I think she said Mr. Bonfeild procured them. I mentiond in   a few other articles. I am going to marry one of my family to a young fellow whom you liberated from jail, a son of Capt. Newcombs, to the Jane Glover who has lived 7 years with me and as she never would receive any wages from me I think myself obligated to find her necessaries for house keeping. I have been buying land, and my last adventure came to so poor a market, that I am quite broke. My letter is an unreasonable long one, yet I may take an other sheet of paper -- not to night however. I will bid you good  [night] by I seal this least Mr. Smith should sail before I return. Mean to write more. Have a Letter for Mr. T  "
june 30 1783,"My Dearest Friend I wrote you a Letter  a fortnight ago to send per this opportunity, but meeting with the Consul in  Boston, he  me, that the America would sail in a few days. I gave it to him and hope it has reachd you as he promised a particular attention to it. Mr. Smith will be the Bearer of this; I need not ask your particular attention to him. He is most worthy and Good, Benevolent and kind, Generous to his Friends and connections who stand in need of his assistance; he has been industerous and successfull in Buisness, and is untainted by the vices of the age. Yet with all these virtues and accomplishments he has not found Success among the Fair. Why? Because he has not address. I know not any other reason. He can inform you of our little excursion to  Haverhill where he was kind enough to accompany me, on a visit to my sister and our two dear Boys, whom I found well pleased with their Situation. I tarried with them 8 days. Whilst I was there, Charles whose constitution is exceedingly delicate was seazd with a pluratick disorder. Giving him an Emetick and attending immediately to him, he so far recoverd as to be able to ride home with me, to which the doctor advised. And it was of so much service to him, that I hope he will be able to return to his studies in a week or ten days. The weather was so extreemly hot, and the fatigue of my journey, has so enfeabled me that I scarcly know how to hold my pen. The Country looks well, and the season is promising, tho rather dry. But I never shall take a journey which will be truly pleasent to me, unaccompanied by my Friend. And yet how few in the course of 19 years that we have been connected, have we taken together? Tho your life has been one continued Scene of journeying, in the early part of my Life, Maternal duties prevented my accompanying you, and in the Later the Stormy Scenes of war. Few persons who so well Love demestick Life as my Friend; have been calld, for so long a period, to relinquish the enjoyment of it; yet like the needle to the pole, you invariably turn towards it, as the only point where you have fixed your happiness. It is this belief which has supported me thus far through the voyage, but alass how often have I felt the want of my pilot, obliged  ""to act my little part alone."" I cannot say with Dyanthe that I wished not for my associate. And is the time near at hand, when Heaven will again bless us in the Society of each other? I would fain flatter myself that it is. O! May we taste, may we drink of the cup of happiness without one alloy, and be as blest as we can bear,  ""all Various Nature pressing on the Heart."" Thus let us retire into ourselves, and rejoice in the purity of our affections, the simplicity of our manners and the Rectitude of our Hearts, for without an ostentatious boast we may claim them all. But from this picture of  felicity shall I reverse the Medal and shew you a political state of discontent, jealousy, and rangling. The Stormy Scenes of war have subsided -- but in lieu of them, what have we -- a Legislature composed of wise Heads, and skillfull hands -- by their deeds shall ye know them. By the best information I can obtain few of these  parts are like to become troublesome to our Legislators the present year. In my last I gave you some account of them, and the principal upon which many of them were Elected. Last week came on the choice of delegates for Congress, and every Member who composed the last, was left out. They even went so far, as to propose recalling them immediately; and voting that they should never be again chosen. Here I believe they exceeded the bounds of the constitution, and the limits of Reason. So high does the spirit run against commutation to the Army.  Connecticut I hear has voted their Army one years pay, and  Road Island were doing something of the kind. All seem determined to act contrary to the Resolve of Congress. The Army are disbanding fast, without a six pence to bear their expences home; and live upon the kindness of the people. The New Members chosen for Congress are our Friend Mr. Gerry, who is gone on, Mr. Dalton your old Friend, Mr. Partridge, Mr. Danilson, Judge Sullivan. I have engaged our Friend Dr. Tufts to write you fully upon political matters. He will give you much better information than I am able to; yet I cautiond him not to coulour even to the Life, least you should reluct at the Idea of a return to us. Yet no one has experienced a larger share of the turbulent scenes of political Life than my Friend, or steared through them with more honour and reputation. I heed not the little sarcastick reflextions of Reviewers, Magazine writers or News paper scriblers and rather consider it as a compliment, than a reflextion, that they should have nothing to offer against my Friend, but that he was not nobly descended. Mean are those arts indeed which would derogate from the Merit of a Man, upon account of the honest occupation of his parents. The truly noble mind spurns the Idea. I hope my dear  is with you. I long to hear from him, much more to see him. I shall expect you by September. Do not delay it till late in the year. I shall continue writing to you untill you tell me You are about to embark. Continue to Frank your letters, if they catch one without they make me pay enormously. I Sent per the America  a little invoice  of a few articles. As there is little hazard of the loss of the Letter, I do not think it worth repeating. Our Friends are all well and desire to be affectionately rememberd to you. I call upon Nabby to write you and suppose she will.   "
july 21 1783,"My Dearest Friend I last evening received a Letter from  dated in April, and Mr. Storer received Letters from his Son, but not a line has yet come to hand from you. I Know not what to think. I should feel more anxious, but Mr. Thaxter mentiond you as well. I fancy you must feel impatient at the delay of your return. I fear you will compleat the four years before you reach  America. Do not think of a winter voyage, I dread this coast in winter. From a state of our publick affairs, the knowledge of which will reach you, if your Friends have written as they promised you will feel, both a wish, and a reluctance at a speedy return. A Gentleman observed to me the other day, that he believed you had served your Country almost long enough to be forgotten. But it will not be a forgetfulness that will diminish or depreciate your Services, but jealousy and envy of those abilities which have crowned you with Success; the insolence of wealth will  to trample down what it cannot emulate. But it is an observation of Swifts, that persons of transcendent merit force their way in spight of all obsticals, but that those whose merit was of a second third or fourth rate, were seldom able to perform any thing; because the Knaves and dunces of the World, had all the impudence, assiduity, flattery, and servile, compliance, divided among them; which kept them continually in the Way; and engaged every body to become their Solicitors. Swifts observations generally carry a Sting with them -- yet he had too much reason for his severity. There is a position in Machiavel says a late elegant writer that a country should sometimes be without order, and over run with all sorts of calamities, that Men of great Genius  may distinguish themselves by restoring it. We certainly see a country sufficiently disorderd, and embarrassed to satisfy any speculator in the utmost wantonness of his imagination. But where and to whom shall we look, for a restoration of internal peace and good order, so necessary for the preservation of that very freedom for which we have so long and so successfully contended. Tis a long time since I heard from You. I  myself that when there was no danger from enemies, that the communication would be much more frequent. I know but little of the movements of Congress, the States are jealous of their  too great power, and there are certain restless Spirits who keep up the Hue and cry, the impost will not go down in any shape, the treasury has no money, and was obliged to borrow of private persons to pay the last Sessions of the court, the most expensive that we ever had and the least performd. No money has ever been paid upon loan office certificates since  France stoped payment. Taxes are Still enormous, what becomes of the money I cannot say. The Soldiers have no pay, and every department is crying out -- give, give. I was lately in conversation with  upon our publick affairs. He told me that the British influence in Congress were all in your favour, and that he was certain, they wished to support you -- that it was matter of great Speculation among the Gallicians, how your aged Colleigue was brought to coinside and act in concert with you. This same Mr. Osgood is a sensible modest Man. When he came from congress, I wished to see him, and he was introduced to me. I made some inquiry of him respecting the situation of my Friend. Ever since that time he has taken  it into his head to be vastly civil to me. I told him I wished he would write you a state of publick affairs. He said he had not the honour of being personally known to you. I promised to introduce him to you, and he has promised to write you, if he goes again to Congress, of which he appears at present doubtfull. The House past a most pointed censure upon him by recalling all their Delegates at once, but when they cooled upon reflection, and when Mr. Dalton refused they chose Mr. Osgood again. I know I cannot recommend him more, than by saying, he appears to me a second Mr. Gerry. Mr. Dalton made me a visit in  Boston the other day, told me he had been writing you, was vastly pleased with your Letter to him not long since. He became acquainted with Nabby at the assembly, the last winter, and has always been very polite to her. He visited me with a request from his daughter, an agreable young Lady of about 16 that I would let Nabby go and tarry a month with her at his country Seat where the family reside in the summer, and at the same time deliverd a Letter from his Daughter pressing the same request. She became acquainted with Nabby at  Haverhill and then insisted upon her making this visit. Mr. Dalton was so polite as to insist upon sending for her when ever she could go. I promised him that as soon as my family got through the Measels which I daily expected them to have, she should go. I think I feel a greater regard for those persons who Love me for your sake, than I should if they Esteemed me on my own account only. Where is my wanderer, is he not yet arrived. I do not forget him, but am anxious to hear from him.   Mrs. Dana too, is desirious of hearing from her long absent Friend. I went to commencment this year at the pressing invitation of my Friends many of whom were there, but I have such unfashonable feelings that I cannot bear to go into publick assemblies. I always find some gentleman who is polite enough to tender me his service, yet I should be pained at receiving that particular attention which every Lady stands in need of when she goes into publick. Besides I have too so much pride, that if I cannot go by your side, and be introduced as your companion, I will not go at all. Adieu my Friend. Heaven bless and prosper you is the ardent wish of yours for ever "
August 24 1783,"My Dearest Friend By  Freeman who Sails on Sunday for  England I embrace the opportunity of writing you a few lines. Mr. Goreham is gone to  Portsmouth to embark from thence, impowerd by the  Town of Charlstown to solicit Charity for them. I have not the best opinion of his errant; nor of his politeness, or I should have Supposed that as he means to apply to you for assistance; he would have Supposed imagined that a Letter from your family would not have been unacceptable, but he moved off, without giving me any notice. I do not regret it much as Capt. Freeman will be so kind as to take this, and carefully forward it. I have written frequently, written by way of  England Since the Peace, and hope you have received my Letters. I have not heard so frequently from you as I wish;  your last date was the 30 of May . I hope it was not long after that date, that you remaind in the dissagreable suspence which you then appeard to be in, and I hope that your publick dispatches were agreable to your mind and that you will not be delayed by them. Every Letter which reaches me places your return at a further remove; I pray that it may not exceed November as I have a dread of our coast. I fear for your Health, and hope a voyage will prove benificial. When I reflect upon the many perplexing scenes, and difficulties through which you have passt in the last ten years, I conceive them sufficient, to batter down a stronger building than the Fabrick you occupy. It is however a pleasing consolation that the Deity which inhabits it, is formed for a duration, beyond the brittle tennament, and is capable of extending its views to an existance more suitable to its nature and capacity -- and where I trust it will meet with a due regard for that Benevolence and good will which upon all occasions, has been exerted for the benifit of Mankind. To the blessings of Peace, we have, that of plenty added. The Earth  in abundance, Ceres  flourishes with her sheaves and her cornicopia. Pomona cannot boast of being so richly laiden, Boreas committed a Robbery upon her in her Infancy which she is not like to recover, and the plague of Eygipt followed him. Our son  is just recoverd from the Measles, and is going again to  Haverhill. I wish his Brother Tom, had been here to have had them with him, my Niece too has had them and recoverd, tho it has proved very mortal in  Boston. Tis said 300 children have been buried since last March. Our Friends are all well, your Mother dined with me to day, and desires to be rememberd to you. I think she enjoys better health than she did a Year ago. I am going with Genll. Warrens family, and a small party of Friends to dine with my  Father. How happy would it make the good old gentleman could you be one of the party; alass the Sons his Daughters have given him, are those only in which he can rejoice. How often have I heard him both with pain and pleasure, say, when reflecting upon his misfortune, I desire to bless God, I have three comforts to one affliction -- and he might have added four, for his Daughter in Law is to him, like an own child in kindness and attention, to be otherways she must be a monster of ingratitude for to her he has supplied the place of Father Mother and husband. There are Six fine children as you would wish to see -- all without a Father, or what is worse. My little Neice who has lived 6 years with me is a sweet Girl, tho she is no Stranger to her unhappy lot. She never speaks a word upon the Subject, all that she ever said was the other day, a stranger had askd who she was. She came with tears in her Eyes and said she wished nobody would ask who she was, or whether she had a Father. She frequently asks whether I think you will let her live with me when you return.  and sister have been with me this week. She is very anxious to hear from Mr. Dana, her last letter was dated 7 months ago. She hopes you will not come without him. I know not how to realize that I shall see you soon. Hope and Fear have been the two ruling passions of a large portion of my Life, and I have been banded from one to the other like a tennis Ball. We are waiting with a degree of impatience for the definitive Treaty. There is nothing New in the political World -- cheating is an old story, even from the Days of Jacob. inclosed is a little poetical performance. You will be at no loss to comprehend it -- it has too much Truth for its basis. I hope  will find his pen once more, his Brother's and Sister desire to be affectionately rememberd. I shall write to him if the vessel does not Sail immediately. Uncle Quincy desires to be rememberd to you. Let Mr. Thaxter know his Friends were all well this week -- are so sanguine with regard to his speedy return that they do not think it worth while to write again. Adieu my dear Friend. So many Ideas  upon me when about to close, that I can utter only that I am Yours.   "
"Braintree  Sepbr 20 1783
","My dearest Friend Dearer if possible than ever; for all the parental props which once  and supported me are fallen! My Father, my Father, where is he? With Humble confidence I can say; he is with the spirits of just Men made perfect, become an inhabitant of that Country, from whose Bourn no traveller returns. In  my last Letter to you , I recollect to have particularly  both our dear and venerable parents. My Father then appeard to sustain his age, with fewer of the infirmities of it, than most aged persons are subject to, his Health, his spirits, and his activity were remarkable. He sat out upon a visit to my sister at  Haverhill, and with an intention of carrying our son Charles, who had just recoverd from the Measles: he reachd here for the Night, and tho he complaind of having felt rather unwell for a few days, he spent as pleasent and cheerfull an evening as I had known him for many Years. About midnight, I waked with his calling a servant, and desireing him to rise, upon which I rose, and went into his Chamber, I found him in great distress with the strangery; I made every application which I could think of untill morning, but his pain increasing he could neither lie nor set, he insisted upon being carried home. It was with great difficulty to himself, that he reachd his own House, where for 15 days he lived in most exquisite distress, during which time no medicine or outward application procured him relief. He supported himself through his distressing pain, and exemplified that Christian patience and fortitude, which he had, through his whole Life taught to others. Not a complaint fell from his Lips during his sickness, his reason was clear to the last moment of his Life; every hour of which, he exerted himself, to admonish and warn the youth, who attended round his Bed,  them to devote themselves early to their Maker. To them and to others, he was with a most Cheerfull resignation, manifesting the joy and comfort, derived from unfeigned piety; and a Life well Spent; he had a well grounded hope; and his last end was peace. His affection towards his children and his grandchildren seemed  by the Idea, of parting with them. O my children, said he, you are so kind and tender, I fear you will make me  to leave you. Through his sickness he was but once heard to say, that he wished it had pleased God to have spaired his Life longer, and that was, to have seen the return of my dearest Friend; but tell him says he, I hope to meet him in a better world. Sweet indeed, is the remembrance of this my dear parent; and his death bed Scene the greatest consolation for his loss.  as it was, I would not have exchanged it, for the triumph of the Greatest Monarch. How trifling, and of how little importance does such a scene, make all the wealth, power and greatness of the world appear. I have; Said my dear parent, made two things the principal Study of my Life, let me  the Same upon my  Children. I have endeavourd to do all the good I could with the talants committed to me, and to honour God with my substance. Well may his Children rise up; and call him blessed -- gratefully acknowledging the hand which bestowed upon them such a parent, doubling their diligence to walk in his Steps. Like good old Jacob, our parent blessed all his ofpring, may our children never forget the Solemn Scene. I know my dear Friend, you will most sensibly feel this bereavement. You have lost one of your firmest Friends, no man could be more delighted, with your successes, or  a higher sense of them, than my dear parent, he knew your Worth, and he honourd it at all times. No man was happier in the sons his daughters had given him, two of whom attended him in his last moments, administering to him, those kind offices, which his afflicted daughters could not perform. In the midst of my affliction several of your kind Letters were brought me. My Heart I hope was not unthankfull to Heaven for the blessing, but my Mind is not sufficiently calm to reply to them. I shall close this and wait a more tranquil hour; how much do I feel the want of the Soothing kindness of the Friend of my Heart. -- The Idea is too  -- adieu.  "
October 19 1783,"My dearest Friend My last Letter to you  was written in  I closed it, because I knew not how to think upon any other subject than the solemn one I had just past through; since that date I have received a Number of Letters from you, written in April, May, june and 2 in july. To hear from you is a satisfaction, but the whole tenor of your Letters rather added to my melancholy, than mitigated it. The state of your Health gives me great anxiety; and the delay of your return increases it. The Season is now so far advanced, that if you embark I shall have a thousand terrors for you; if you tarry abroad; I fear for your Health. If Congress should think proper to make you  appointment, beg you not to accept it. Call me not to any further trials of our long absence from your family, and upon the kind! Reflect upon the necessity there is, of your returning in order to recover that Health which you have unhappily impaired and lost abroad. Your Children have a demand upon You, they want your care, your advice and instruction; I mean at all times to consult and promote their interest and happiness, but I may be mistaken in it; I cannot feel so safe or so satisfied as I should if Your approbation was added to it. There was a time when I had brought my mind to be willing to cross the Seas to be with you, but  one strong tie which held me here, is dissolved, the train of my Ideas for six months past has run wholy upon your return; that I now think nothing short of an assurence from you, that. your happiness depended upon it, would induce me to alter my opinion The Scenes of anxiety through which you have past, are enough to rack the firmest constitution, and debilitate the strongest faculties. Conscious Rectitude is a grand support, but it will not ward of the attacks of envy, or secure from the attacks  assaults of jealousy. Both ancient and modern history furnish us with repeated proofs, that virtue must look beyond this shifting theatre for its reward; but the Love of praise is a passion deeply rooted in the mind and in this we resemble the Supreem Being who is most Gratified with thanksgiving and praise. Those who are most affected with it, partake most of that particle of divinity which distinguishes mankind from the inferiour  [illegible]  Creation; no one who deserves commendation can dispise it, but we too frequently see it refused where it is due, and bestowed upon very undeserving characters.  ""Treachery venality and villainy must be the Effects of dissipation voluptuousness and impiety says the Great Dr. Price and adds,  these vices sap the foundation of virtue, they render Men necessitous and Supple, ready at any time to sacrifice their consciences. Let us remember these Truths in judging of Men. Let us consider that true goodness is uniform and consistant; and learn never to place any great confidence in those pretenders to publick Spirit, who are not men of virtuous Characters. They may boast of their attachment to a publick cause, but they want the living root of virtue, and should not be depended upon."" You call upon me to write you upon a subject which greatly embarrasses me, yet I ought to tell you what I conceive to be the real Truth.  whom I formerly mentiond to you, resides here Still, and boards in the same family. I wrote you the Truth when I informd you that the connection was broken of -- and nothing particular has since past. Yet it is evident to me, as well as to the family where he lives, that his attachment is not lessned. He conducts prudently, and tho nothing is said upon the subject I do not immagine that he has given up the Hope, that in some future Day he may be able to obtain your approbation. Your daughter so highly values your esteem and approbation, that She has frequently said she never could be happy without it. That she will not act contrary to the opinion of her Friends, I am fully satisfied, but her sentiments with regard to this Gentleman she says are not to be  changed but upon a conviction of his demerrit. I wish most sincerely wish you was at Home to judge for yourself. I shall never feel safe or happy untill you are. I had rather you should inquire into his conduct and behaviour, his success in Buisness and his attention to it, from the family where he lives, than Say any thing upon the subject myself. I can say with real Truth that no Courtship subsists between them, and that I believe it is in your power to put a final period to every Idea of the kind, if upon your return you think best. There is a young Gentleman, who formerly kept our school, by the Name of Perkings, who is now studying Law with Mr. Tyler. He has been in  Virgina for a twelve month past and designs to return there again. I was very unhappy to find by your Letters that you was so long without any intelligence from  America, but I hope you have been amply compensated before this time. Your Letters which were dated in April May and  did not reach me untill Sep'br. I must request you in future to calculate those you send to  Philadelphia for the post office. Every line of yours is invaluable to me, yet blank paper is not so, and the double covers pay as large postage, as if they were wholy written. I have disputed the matter some time with the postmaster, and now he will not deliver a Letter untill the postage is pay'd. I payd 3 dollors the other day for what one sheet of paper would have containd. I do not yet believe that congress mean to make their foreign ministers subject to postage, and I design to write to Mr. Gerry upon the Subject. I hear of a vessel bound to  France. I will forward this and write to  by way of  England. I hear he is there, and that Mr. Smith arrived in after a short passage. At this I rejoice tho I was not his companion. Our two sons are gone to  Haverhill. I hope to hear frequently from you if I do not see   you, which I now almost dispair of, this winter.  "
"Braintree  November 11 1783
","My dearest Friend  has been so kind as to visit me, and request a Letter from me to you; I have promised him one. You direct me to write by every opportunity, I very seldom let one slip unimproved, but I find many more conveyances by way of  England than any other. I have written twice to you since the recept of  your last favour , which was dated july 17th. I wish you to write by way of  England but to send no letters to the southard. I pleased myself with the Idea of seeing you here during the summer, but when I found how  Buisness was delayed I endeavourd to banish the Idea, for one month of daily expectation, is more tedious than a year of certainty. I think it would be a releif to my mind if your next Letter was to assure me, that you had no intention of comeing out till next spring; Yet think not, that I am more reconciled to your absence, or less ardently desire your return, but your Life and Health are too dear to me, to gratify my wishes at the expence of either. I have but last evening , from a visit to  Haverhill, where I was led at this season, by the Sickness of Master Tommy, who has a Second time experienced a severe fit of the Rheumatism. It was an unfortunate bequest, but it is so Similar to what at his age I was excersised with, that I think it must have descended to him. He lost the use of his Limbs for a fortnight. It was attended with a fever, and a Stricture across his Breast. I had the Satisfaction to find him upon the recovery, and much better than my fears, for Seazing him at this Season and with so much voilence, I feard he would have been disabled all winter. Both , speak very well of our young Lads, who begin to think of a Colledge Life, as not more than a year and half distance. Charles is very desirious that he may be ready at 15, and Master Tommy is determined that he shall not out strip him, in his learning, what ever he may do in his entrance at colledge, for which purpose he requests that his lessons may be the same with his Brothers. He took great pains to overtake Charles, during his absence   and sickness with the Measles, nor did he rest untill he accomplished it. Mr. Shaw is I believe an excellent preceptor and takes great pains with them. Their Morals and Manners are strickly attended to, and I have every satisfaction I can wish with respect to care and tenderness both in sickness and Health. I wanted for nothing but to see you Mamma, says Master, during my sickness. Mrs. Shaw is the same amiable good woman you always knew her. She has one son and one daughter, but her Health is feeble and her frame exceedingly delicate and tender, her spirits lively, her temper placid. The children Love her with a  [parental?] filial affection. I longed for you to accompany me in this journey, and to have participated the pleasure of seeing our Children attentive to their studies, and  to be wise and good. While your own Heart dilates, you will tell me, that the season for temptation is not yet arrived, that  they are carefully Guarded against evil communications, and warned of the danger of bad examples, no humane foresight can effectually preserve them from the contagion of vice; true, but I have a great opinion of early impressions of virtue, and believe that they take such hold of the mind, as neither time, or temptations can wholy subdue. They recall the wanderer to a sense of his Duty, tho he has strayed many many times. Attend says the Good Ganganella, more to the Hearts, than the understanding of your pupils, if the Heart is good, all will go well. I have a thousand fears for my dear Boys as they rise into Life, the most critical period of which is I conceive, at the university; there infidelity abounds, both in example and precepts, there they imbibe the speicious arguments of a Voltaire a Hume and Mandevill. If not from the fountain, they receive  them at second hand. These are well calculated to intice a youth, not yet capable of investigating their principals, or answering their arguments. Thus is a youth puzzeld in Mazes and perplexed with error  untill he is led to doubt, and from doubting to disbelief. Christianity gives not such a pleasing latitude to the passions. It is too pure, it teaches moderation humility and patience, which are incompatable, with the high Glow of Health, and the warm blood which riots in their veins. With them,  ""to enjoy, is to obey"" I hope before either of our children are prepaird for colledge you will be able to return and assist by your example and advise, to direct and counsel them; that with undeviating feet they may keep the path of virtue. I have  been able to obtain their Love their confidence and obedience, but I feel unequal to the task of guiding them alone, encompassed as I know they must be with a thousand snares and temptations. I hope  abroad will not imbibe any sentiments or principals which will not be agreable to the Laws the Goverment and Religion of our own Country. He has been less under your Eye than I could wish, but never I dare say without your advise and instruction. If he does not return this winter, I wish you to remind him, that he has forgotten to use his pen, to his Friends upon this Side the water. With Regard to what passes in the political world I hear little said upon the subject. We are anxious to receive official accounts of the Signing the definitive Treaty. The Merchants will  if the commercial Treaty is not to their taste. The Peace necessitates many of them to a less extravagant mode of living, and they must retrench still more if ever they pay their debts abroad. Bills are now sold at par, if you continue abroad, I shall be under a necessity of drawing upon you, for tho the War is ceased, taxes have not. Since I took my pen, and within this hour, I have been visited by the collector with 3 tax Bills; the amount of which is 29 pounds 6 and 8 pence, the continental tax state tax and town tax, beside which, I have just paid a parish tax. I live with all the frugality in my power. I have but two domesticks, yet I find it as much as I can do to muster cash enough to pay our sons Quarter Bills and Cloath them decently. Of one thing you may rest assured, that I involve you in no debts,  go one Inch without seeing my way  Clear; you laugh at me with regard to my  Virmont purchase. I still value it, and do not doubt of its becomeing so. I have a Right in about  [2?] hundred acers of land some where in  Northburry which comes to me from my Mother; I will exchange with you. My Father left to me and Mrs. Shaw his  Medford Farm stock buildings &c. and his medow in  Malden the value of which is Estimated at near 800. Now what I wish is to persuade my Sister to sell you her part of the Farm, and make a purchase in the Town where they she lives, but I do not chuse to Say any thing upon the Subject at present. I Suppose it will sell for more than the apprizement, and as I hope you will return early in the spring, that will be as soon as any thing can be done about it. The estate is some cloged in concequence of a Numerous family but the personal estate will clear it and pay the Legacies which amount to about 300 pounds and Some small debts. "
NA,  
November 20 1783,"My dearest Friend Your  dated at  Amsterdam in july  was last evening handed to me; and this evening    by Col. Ogden reached me.   [John Adams sent two letters to Abigail on 10 September.]  I had for some time supposed that the delay of  buisness would retard your return; hearing that the definitive treaty was not compleated untill september, and knowing that the commercial Treaty was still to form; I had little reason to expect you; unless your State of Health required an immediate resignation of all your publick employments. Your Letter therefore which informs me of your determination to pass an other Winter abroad is by no means unexpected. That we must pass it with a vast ocean between us; is a painfull reflection to me, yet thus it must be; I am so much of a coward upon the Water, that even a summers voyage had its terrors. A Winter passage I cannot possibly think of encountering. If I was instantly to set about it, I could not adjust my affairs so as to leave them in any order under a month. Mr. Temple and family sail this week. I do not know any person except Mr. Jackson  [of] Newburryport, who is going abroad; with whom I should like to become  [a] passenger, and he goes to  Ireland. But I have a stronger objection than even a winters voyage against  at present. It is the undetermined counsels of Congress. They have not yet made any appointment to the Court of  Britain. Many are seeking for the place, with more splendid titles, if wealth can give them, and many more thousands to claim it with: I am informd that Mr. Jay, has written pressingly to Congress in your favour, at the same time assureing them, that he would absolutely refuse the appointment, if it should be offerd him; but whether you will finally be the person, is left to futurity. Of this I am sure, that I do not wish it. I should have liked very well, to have gone to  France, and resided there a year, but to think of going to  England in a  Character, and resideing there; engageing at my time of life in Scenes quite New, attended with dissipation parade and  Nonsence; I am sure I should make an awkward figure. The retired Domestick circle  ""the feast of reason and the flow of soul"" are my Ideas of happiness, and my most ardent wish is, to have you return and become Master of the Feast. My Health is infirm, I am frequently  with a nervious pain in my Head, and a fatigue of any kind will produce it. Neither of us appear to be built for duration. Would to Heaven the few remaining days allotted Us, might be enjoyed together. I have considerd it as my misfortune, that I could not attend to your Health, watch for your repose, alleviate your Hours of anxiety, and make you a home where ever you resided. More says a very skillfull Dr. depends upon the Nurse than the physician. My present determination is to tarry at home this winter; lonely as it is without my children; and if I cannot prevail upon you to return to Me in the Spring -- you well know that I may be drawn to you. One strong tie which held me here is dissolved, ; who used to say:  I cannot consent to you going child, whilst I live. An other cord and almost the only one which binds me to this place, is like to be loosed. I mean Mr. Cranchs family who talk of removeing to  Boston in the Spring. Should this take place  Braintree would indeed become a lonely spot to me.  will be able to give me when he arrives; the best intelligence upon the Subject. I hope I shall not miss the French Brig which was to sail , but may possibly be detained. I knew not of her going untill last evening. Adieu and believe me whether present or absent, most affectionately   "
"Braintree  December 7 1783
","My Dearest Friend Will you  a Bill of mine, drawn in favour of Uncle Smith for 60 pounds, to pay for 9 acres of wood land which I have purchased of William Adams being part of the estate of Benjamin Ruggles, which fell to Mr. Adams in right of his wife. You will think I have given a large price for it, but it is not so much as your Brother has given him for a 6 acre Lot adjoining to his. The Lot I have purchased is much nearer home, and much easier getting the wood of than any which you owned before of so large a Growth. I am informd that it is very well wooded, and if I was inclined to have a part cut of, for the market, I might at the price wood bears now; raise the money with a third of the wood; it fetches 7 dollors a cord, in  Boston, oweing to the few vessels which remained to us after the peace, and these all imployed in carrying Lumber, so that no wood comparitively speaking has been brought from  [the?] eastward this fall. I gave 6 pounds pr acre and have trusted to my  [credit] with you to reimburse me the money I have paid for it, it being what I had collected for the payment of my present taxes and my Quarters Board and Schooling for my children. The land cost a hundred and eighty dollors. I have drawn for 200 being an even Sum. I have not heard any thing further from you since your Letters of      , which I replied to immediately and hope you received the answers to them. Mr. Thaxter it is said arrived at  New York the 20 of November and proceeded on to Congress immediately.  Callihan in the Peace and Plenty, is not yet arrived, and we are anxious for him as he saild the 7 of October. I hope to receive Letters by him. We have had most terrible weather upon this coast. I have  your invitation to me, the arguments for and against it, with all the deliberation I am mistress of. I have arranged before me all your former objections, I have added to them the state of your Health  as you have discribed it, and upon the whole, your return here, is the object my Heart pants for. A relaxation from the fatigues and vexations of publick Life appears necessary for your Health, from these you cannot be exempted whilst you continue abroad. The envyed embassy to a certain Islands is surrounded with so many thorns, that the Beauty and fragrance of the Rose, would be but a small compensation for the wounds which might be felt in the gatheiring and wearing it. If you felt yourself under obligations during the dangers and perilous of war, to sacrifice, your Health your ease and safety, to the  and freedom of your Country, those obligations cannot now be equally binding. The Golden Fleese is won. If you have no female wiles to contend with, the dragon may secure it to us; but I believe it is as necessary that he should reside watch in  America as  Europe. Letters from  last  [night] from  Haverhill inform me of their Health, and of their intention of writing to their Pappa and Brother by the next opportunity.  lies very dangerously ill of a Lethargy I shall write you again very soon, for the present adieu. I know not whether I shall believe myself how well you Love me, unless I can prevail upon you to return in the Spring to your ever affectionate I have  that the vessel which carried  Letters from me  answers to your last from  Amsterdam and letters to Johnny in reply to his and Letters in reply to your of Sepbr. this vessel is dismasted and returnd into port  Cape Cod after having been out 3 weeks so that what fate the Letters will meet with I know not. Mr. Dana, arrived in  Boston yesterday from  Petersburgh. I have not time to Say what my Sensations were. A flood of tears unbidden flowed from my Eyes. Yet I am sure I sincerely rejoiced in his return. Mr. Thaxter has not yet reached  Braintree. I received a letter from him  [ . . . ]  dated  New York  [illegible]   December 3. He had been to  Philadelphia and was upon his return. I shall in a few days write you again.  "
"Braintree  December 15 1783
"," My Dearest Friend I returned last Evening from  Boston, where I went at the kind invitation of  and Aunt, to celebrate our Anual festival. Doctor Cooper being dangerously Sick, I went to hear Mr. Clark; who is Setled with Dr. Chauncey; this Gentleman gave us an animated elegant and sensible discourse, from Isaah 55 chapter and 12th verse --  ""For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with Peace; the Mountains and the Hill Shall break forth before you into singing, and all the Trees of the Field shall clap their Hands."" Whilst he  Glory and praise unto the most high, he considerd the Worthy disinterested, and undaunted Patriots as the instruments in the hand of providence for accomplishing what was marvelous in our Eyes; he recapitulated the dangers they had past through, and the hazards they had run; the firmness which had in a particular manner distinguished Some Characters, not only early to engage in so dangerous a contest, but in spight of our gloomy prospects they persevered even unto the end; untill they had obtained a Peace Safe and Honorable; large as our designs, Capacious as our wishes, and much beyond our expectations. How did my heart dilate with pleasure when as each event was particularized; I could trace my Friend as a Principal in them; could say, it was he, who was one of the first in joinning the Band of Patriots; who formed our first National Counsel. It was he; who  happy in his domestick attachments; left his wife, his Children; then but Infants; even surrounded with the Horrours of war; terified and distresst, the Week after the memorable 17th. of April, Left them, to the protection of that providence which has never forsaken them, and joined himself undismayed, to that Respectable Body, of which he was a member. Trace his conduct through every period, you will find him the same undaunted Character: encountering the dangers  of the ocean; risking Captivity, and a dungeon; contending with wickedness in high places; jeoparding his Life, endangerd by the intrigues, revenge, and malice, of a potent; tho defeated Nation. These are not the mere eulogiums of conjugal affection; but certain facts, and solid truths. My anxieties, my distresses, at every period; bear witness to them;  now by a series of prosperous events; the recollection, is more sweet than painfull. Whilst I was in Town,  arrived very unexpectedly, for I had not received  your Letter by Mr. Thaxter   . My uncle fortunately discoverd him, as he come up into  State Street, and instantly engaged him to dine with him, acquainting him that I was in Town, and at his House. The news soon reached my Ears. Mr. Dana arrived, Mr. Dana arrived -- from every person you saw, but how was I affected? The Tears involuntary flowed from my eyes, tho God is my witness, I envyed not the felicity of others. Yet my Heart swelled with Grief, and the Idea that I, I only, was left alone, recall'd all the tender Scenes of seperation, and overcame all my fortitude. I retired and reasoned myself into composure sufficient; to see him without a childish emotion. He tarried but a short time, anxious as you may well imagine, to reach  Cambridge. He promised me a visit with , in a few days, to which I look forward with pleasure. I  home last evening, having left Nabby in Town, to make her winter visit. I found Mr. Thaxter just arrived before me. It was a joyfull meeting to both of us, tho I could not prevail with him only for half an hour; his solicitude to see his Parents was great, and tho I wished his continuance with me  yet I checked not the fillial flow of affection. Happy youth! who had parents still alive to visit, Parents who can rejoice in a Son returned to them after a long absence; untainted in his morals, improved in his understanding; with a Character fair and unblemished. But O my dearest Friend what shall I say to You in reply to your pressing invitation; I have already written to you in answer to  your Letters which were dated  10th   and reachd me a month before those by Mr. Thaxter. I related to you all my fears respecting a winters voyage. My Friends are all against it, and Mr. Gerry as you will see, by the Coppy of his Letter inclosed, has given his opinion upon well grounded reasons. If I should leave my affairs in the Hands of my Friends, there would be much to think of, and much to do, to place them in that method and order I would wish to leave them in. Theory and  are two very different things; and the object magnifies, as I approach nearer to it. I think if you were abroad in a private Character, and necessitated to continue there; I should not hesitate so much at comeing to you. But a mere American as I am, unacquainted with the Etiquette of courts, taught to say the thing I mean, and to wear my Heart in my countantance, I am sure I should make an awkward figure. And then it would mortify my pride if I should be thought to disgrace you. Yet strip Royalty of its pomp, and power, and what are its votaries more than their fellow worms? I have so little of the Ape about me; that I have refused every publick invitation to figure in the Gay World, and sequestered myself in this Humble cottage, content with rural Life and my domestick employments in the midst of which; I have sometimes Smiled, upon recollecting that I had the Honour of being allied to an Ambassadors Yet I have for an example the chaste Lucretia  who was found spinning in the midst of her maidens, when the Brutal Tarquin plotted her distruction. I am not acquainted with the particular circumstances attending the renewal of your commission; if it is modeled so as to give you satisfaction I am content; and hope you will be able to discharge it, so as to receive the approbation of your Sovereign. A Friend of yours in Congress some months ago, sent me an extract of a Letter, requesting me to conceal his Name, as he would not  to have it known by what means he procured the Coppy. From all your Letters I discoverd that the treatment you had received, and the suspence You was in, was sufficiently irritating without any thing further to add to Your vexation. I therefore surpresst the extract; as I knew the author was fully known to you: but seeing a letter from G-n W-n  [General Warren] to you, in which this extract is alluded to; and finding by your late Letters, that your situation is less embarrassing, I inclose it; least you should think it much worse than it really is: at the same time I cannot help adding an observation which appears pertinant to me; that there is an ingredient necessary in a Mans composition towards happiness, which people of feeling would do well to acquire -- a certain respect for the follies of Mankind. For there are so many fools whom the opinion of the world entittles to regard; whom accident has placed in heights of which they are unworthy, that he who cannot restrain, his contempt or indignation at the sight, will be too, often Quarrelling with the disposal of things to realish that Share, which is allotted to himself."" And here my paper obliges me to close the subject -- without room to say adieu.  "
December 27 1783,"My Dearest Friend I did not receive  your Letter of August the 14th .  this very Evening; I was much gratified to find I had done what you directed, before your Letter reach'd me. That is, that I had bought a wood Lot. Concerning this purchase  I have already written to you ; but least that letter should not arrive, I will repeat, that the Lot I have purchased is a part of 27 acres which belonged to Samuel Ruggles, and in the division of that estate fell to William Adams in right of his wife. Out of regard to you, as he says whom he has carried about in his arms (and now I Suppose feels a merit in it) he came to offer it to me, and an other reason I told him I fancyed weigh'd full as much; which was that he wanted the money down. I inquired of my Neighbours and took the advise of your Brother, who purchased at the Same time a 7 acre Lot adjoining to his, and I bought the Lot containing 9 acres and gave him 20 donors per acre; which at that time I thought a large price. But this week 5 acres of wood, upon Ruggles'es homestead was sold at vendue at a hundred and fifty dollors per acre, for the wood only; and purchased by persons able to pay for it. They estimate the wood 3 dollors per cord standing; you will from hence conclude, that money is very plenty, or wood very scarce. The latter only is true. The scarcity of vessels to transport wood from the eastward has been such, that during all the war; the  Town of Boston was never so bare. The land I purchased before, is part of the Grove below the Hill, and not an ax has been put to it since the purchase. I had it immediately fenced in with stone wall; I wish I could have commanded the whole, but some of the Children are not of age, and the Father in Law is levelling this  woods without mercy. Mr. Vesey I hear is  to make me an offer of his Farm, but here I shall be wholy at a loss. He is determined to sell, and I dare not buy without hearing from you; taxes run so high upon land that he has discoverd that he is a looser, as he cannot himself improve it.  If my dear Friend you will promise to come home, take the Farm into your own hands and improve it, let me turn dairy woman, and assist you in getting our living this way; instead of running away to foreign courts and leaving me half my Life to mourn in widowhood, then I will run you in debt for this Farm; I have a hundred pounds sterling which I could command upon such an occasion, but which upon all others is a deposit I do not chuse to touch. I will however let you know his terms, and if he should not sell untill spring, I may possibly by that time learn your pleasure. I have had an offer of ten acres more of wood land, but having just purchased I dared not venture further,  I received your approbation, and now the owner does not chuse to part with it, and I could not advise him to, as he will be under no necessity of doing it. Mrs. Boreland since her return to  America, has sold her House and Farm in this Town. has made the purchase at a thousand pounds Lawfull Money. The estate chiefly came by her. None of it was ever confiscated; it is considerd in Town as a good Bargain, there is about a hundred and eight acres in the whole 50 of which is fine wood land. The Garden contains the best collection of fruit in Town, and there is land enough contiguous to it, to be sold, to make a very pretty Farm, when ever he finds himself able to make an addition. I should deceive you if I did not tell you that I believe this Gentleman has but one object in view, and that he bends his whole attention to an advancement in his profession and to an  in his affairs which enables him to pay for this purchase without being involved at all; he looks forward to some future day with a hope that he may not be considerd unworthy a connection in this family. The forms of courtship as the word stiles it, do not subsist between the young folks, but I am satisfied that both are fixed, provided your consent may one day be obtained. She intends however to take a voyage with me, provided I cross the water. The opinion you express with regard to the chief seat of  , is perfectly agreable to my sentiments. Ever since I  since I have been capable of observation I have been fully satisfied that it is a most unthankfull office, subject to continual wranglings. And tho by a very general voice, you are and have been named as a successor, and your return earnestly wished for on that account, yet I have generally chosen to be silent upon the subject. There was even a proposal of putting you up last year, upon the Faith of your being here during the summer. It was mentiond to me, and I beged that no such thing might take place, as I was certain it would be very dissagreable to you, and instead of serving your interest, would greatly injure you. The  Health is much upon the decline. He has been confined more than half of the last year and unable to do any buisness on account of the Goute. I most sincerely wish you would prosecute the plan  in  your Letter . I feel myself so much better calculated for private and domestick Life, that it is with pain I think of any other. And I cannot yet help hoping You will return in the Spring of the year. Your ill Health distresses me and your complaints allarm me. Congress have gone to  Anapolis in  Maryland. I shall constantly  to inform myself of what passes there respecting my Friend, and to transmit it to you. In this state we appear to be in a much better temper than we were at the commencment of the year; things appear Setling into their old channel. Many of our Gay Gentry are returning to  New York from whence they came. Commutation will go quietly down, the impost is passt in this state.Mr. Moris asscribes this, wholy to the extracts of your Letters which he sent to the Govenour, and through him to the assembly. They had  a great influence tis true, and turnd the scale in favour of it. Mr. Morris mentiond the success you had obtaind in  Holland respecting the loans with great approbation, as Mr. Thaxter informd me. He has been sick ever since his return confined to the house, so that I have only seen him for half an hour.  had furnished me with money to pay for my wood land before Mr. Thaxter arrived, upon my promiseing him a Bill. He wished to have it drawn upon  London, but the Sum he wanted was 300 Dollors and I wanted two only. He is uncertain with respect to the Bill whither it will be upon  Holland or  England. If it is drawn upon  Holland I had better apply to the Merchants you mention, because there is some expence attending the negotiation if it must be sent from thence to  Paris. Bills upon  London are in most demand, and would be more advantageous. I will make the best use of your remittance in my power. You do not mention having sent me the articles  I wrote for , the Irish  I should have been very glad of, and half a dozen pound of Hyson tea, we do not get any such as you used to send me. I  to you a paper containing Govenour Trumbles farewell, which would do honour to an old Roman. A scheme for a Bank, which I am informd is already nearly fill'd, the utility I am no judge of.  life is dispaird of, I shall mourn his loss. He has been by some very unkindly used and many gross falshoods reported of him, amongst the rest, that you had written a Letter last spring in which you had named 3 Gentlemen as pensioners to  France, the Govenour,Dr. Cooper and Judge Sullivan. This I denied upon all occasions, and traced it to the Temple of Scandle. Trust not that Man. He means to visit you, and will bring you letters I suppose. I hope you know him. Adieu. "
NA, 
Sunday Janry 3. 1784,"My dearest Friend I have already written you  3 Letters   , which have been waiting a long time for a passage; they will now all go in one ship, provided I can get this to Town ; tho She was ordered for sailing today, yet I trust to the delay which vessels usually have. Last evening I received a packet of Letters from  who has been in Town a month; inclosing  Your Letters   by Mr. Robbins, who arrived in a passage of 33 days only. By him, I was happy to hear you were well when he left you, but alass! you know not the anxiety I suffer upon account of your Health, or how often my Heart is overwhelmed, with the Idea that I never shall see you more.  I cannot without terrour, think of your going to reside at  the Hague, indeed you cannot live in that country, and you have repeatedly told me so. Why then will you risk a Life invaluably dear to me; and for the comfort and enjoyment of which, there is no earthly pleasure, I would not willingly relinquish; and it is the apprehension which I have for your precarious Health, and the hope that by a  attention I may be able to preserve it, that leads me to seriously to think of quitting all my Friends and my dear Boys, to cross the ocean, coward as I am; without Husband or son to protect or support me; it is one thing to encounter dangers or difficulties with you; and an other without you. Why with a Heart Susceptable of every tender impression, and feelingly alive, have I So often been called to Stand alone and support myself through Scenes which have almost torn it , not I fear, because I have more resolution or fortitude than others, for my resolution often fails me; and my fortitude wavers. As my own judgment, and the advice of my Friends, will prevent my  out this winter, I shall by spring  know the determinations of congress with respect to your situation, and in some measure be governed by them.  writes me thus,  ""this mor'g I was agreeably Surprized by the sight of Mr. Robbins, who came with Letters from Pappa and my Brother. You will see that I have taken the liberty to open them, which I hope your own feelings will lead you to excuse. I find my dear Pappa has again been sick with a severe fever. O Mamma what have we not to fear from his continuance abroad in climates so enemical to his Health? I shudder at the thought, and wish he could be prevailed upon to consider his danger."" ""I know perfectly well how I should act with regard to Pappas requests, were I exatly in your situation,  I own, I now dread the result. Yet my duty, and my fears for the critical state of his Health, operate so powerfully upon my mind being never absent from my thoughts, that I would rather influence than dissuade you from going."" In  of your last Letters I shall immediately set about putting all our affairs in such a train as that I may be able to leave them in the spring; you have written to me with Regard to Mr. Alleynes Farm, during the war he talked of selling; but I have heard nothing of it of late. I will have him sounded, and if he should sell, leave it in charge with some Friend to purchase if you can; the land you mention belonging to Col. Quincy I know he wants to sell. Mr. Tyler applied to him for it tho not very pressingly, before he purchased Mrs. Borelands Farm, but the  Col. had got such wild notions of foreigners of fortune comeing over to settle here, and the high value of Land, that there was no reason in him; but after he heard that Mrs. Boreland had sold her Farm, of which he had then no Idea, he was shagreen'd that he did not sell it, and has since offerd it to him, but he asked 26 pound pr acre. I will take the opinion of your Brother and one or two others, of the real value of it; and make him an offer, through some Friend, for if he  should suspect that you wanted it, he would immediately suppose that it was because you knew of gentlemen of fortunes comeing over, and supposed land would run very high near  Boston. There is a method of laying out money to more advantage than by the purchase of , which a Friend of mine advised me to, for it is now become a regular merchandize. Dr. T-s  [Tufts] has sold a Farm with a design of vesting it in this manner, viz in State Notes. Provision is now made for the anual payment of Interest, and the Notes have all been consolidated. Foreigners and monied Men have, and are purchaseing them at 7 shillings upon the pound, 6 and 8 pence they have been sold at. I have mentiond to you that I have a hundred pounds sterling in the hands of a Friend, I was thinking of adding the 50 you sent me, and purchaseing 600 pounds L M in state Notes provided I can get them at 7 shillings or 6 and 8 pence. This would yeald me an anual interest of 36 pounds subject to no taxes : and be some thing to leave in the hand of a Friend for the support of our Sons. If I should do this I shall have occasion to draw upon you,  not for any large sum. I wish you would put me in a way to have my Bills answerd in  London, as those will sell above par. If I come out in the Spring I hope to prevail with  to take under his patronage our little cottage and Farm. The care of our two sons I will leave in charge with my two Sisters, but as they reside at  Haverhill, it will chiefly devolve upon Mrs. Shaw. To Mr. Shaw I shall leave the trust of the  Medford estate which was left jointly between my sister and me. It will be his interest to take the best care of it, and to make such arrangements from time to time as he may find necessary. I shall direct him to receive my part of the Rent, as part pay for the schooling of the children. Forgive me if I sometimes use the singular instead of the plural, alass I have been too much necessitated  to it. Mr. Pratt our old tenant still lives upon the Farm. If he continues here it will be necessary to come into new conditions with him. Your account Books I put six months ago; into the hands of , that the whole might not be lost, by insolvent debtors and Refugee Tories as a great part already is. He is in a way to get them adjusted; some little money he has received, many of the accounts he has got into Notes of Hand, which if sued will not admit of dispute as accounts do. Many persons very barefacedly deny their accounts. This is not so much to be wonderd at, when they can totally forget Notes of Hand. The Sloans Bond I sued, and got some land under mortgage which I put upon record. I have some thoughts of selling at vendue part of the house furniture, as I suppose I could purchase new for what this would fetch. With regard to cloathing, there will be no occasion of my taking more than a change. I could wish to receive any particular directions which you may think proper to give before I embark. To my  I shall apply for to look me out a proper vessel captain &c. My Neice I must send to her Mother. She mourns sadly at the thoughts of my going. I must seem nearer to her than her own Parent, as she has lived 6 years with me, and has little remembrance of any thing before she came to me. She has been as earnest to know the result of every letter from you as if her life depended upon it. I have promised with your consent; that if I live to return she shall come again to me; but I fear that I can no more live in  Holland than you;  a climate no way suited to Rheumatick complaints, of which I have had a larger share than I have for many winters before, and I am so subject to a nervious pain in my head that I think my own Health in a precarious situation. Love to . I have written him by this vessel. "
Janry 15 1784,"My dearest Friend I write you again by this vessel  it seem's as if there was a Spell to detain her; she has  letters of various dates from me     as you will find, some of which I hoped had reachd you, but the vessels by which they were sent, met with bad weather and were dismasted obliged to return into port. This letter will not be able to boast of any other merit than that of being last dated, for I can tell you no News unless what has lately taken place in the natural world, occasiond by a very sudden thaw upon a Quantity of snow; which produced such a freshet as carried away all our Bridges, mills, and in some places houses; filld our cellars with water and distresst us for several days. The Bridge known by the Name of the  Iron Works Bridge in this Town was amongst the number, and for several days people were obliged to pass it in Boats. The Ship Rosamond Capt. Love, bound to  England is the one by which I have written you largely -- belonging to Guild and company. I am studying an arrangement of my affairs and getting into some method to be able if necessary to leave them in the spring. Mr. G-y  [Gerry] writes that the Situation at  Anapolis is pleasing, the New members are Men of abilities and appear right in politicks, that a committe of congress was appointed to take up foreign affairs upon a Broad and liberal basis. Who they are he does not mention, but he appears pleased with the present prospect. I beg you to continue to write me by every opportunity. Our Friends are all well, remember me to  who will find Letters to him by this conveyance. Samll. Cooper Johonet is just arrived, but not untill after the death of his Grandpappa.   "
Febry. 11th 1784,"Two days only are wanting to  six years since my dearest Friend first crost  the Atlantick. But three months of the Six Years have been Spent in  America. The airy delusive phantom Hope, how has she eluded my prospects. And my expectations of your return from month to month, have vanished    You invite me to you, you call me to follow you, the most earnest wish of my soul is to be with you -- but you can  form an Idea of the conflict of my mind. It appears to me such an enterprize, the ocean so formidable, the quitting my habitation and my Country, leaving my Children, my Friends, with the Idea that prehaps I may never see them again, without my Husband to console and comfort me under these apprehensions -- indeed my dear Friend there are hours when I feel unequal to the trial. But on the other hand I console myself with the Idea of being joyfully and tenderly received by the best of Husbands and Friends, and of meeting a dear and long absent Son. But the difference is; my fears, and anxieties, are present; my hopes, and expectations, distant. But avaunt ye Idle Specters, the desires and requests of my Friend are a Law to me. I will sacrifice my present feelings and hope for a blessing in  of my duty. I have already arranged all my family affairs in such a way that I hope nothing will suffer by my absence. I have determined to put into this House  Pheby, to whom my Father gave freedom, by his Will, and the income of a hundred a year during her Life. The Children furnished her to house keeping, and she has   ever since lived by herself, untill a fortnight ago, she took unto her self a Husband in the person of Mr. Abdee whom you know. As there was no setled minister in  Weymouth I gave them the liberty of celebrating their nuptials here, which they did much to their satisfaction. I proposed to her taking care of this House and furniture in my absence. The trust is very flattering to her, and both her Husband and She Seem pleased with it. I have no doubt of their care and faithfullness, and prefer them to any other family. The Farm I continue to let to our old , as no one thinks I shall supply myself better. I am lucky too in being able to supply myself with an honest  Man Servant. I do not know but you may recollect him, John Brisler, who was brought up in the family of Genll. Palmer, has since lived with Col. Quincy and is recommended by both families as a virtuous Steady frugal fellow, with a mind much above the vulgar, very handy and attentive. For a maid servant I hope to have a Sister of his, who formerly lived with Mrs. Trott, who gives her a good character. It gave me some pain to refuse the offerd service of an old servant who had lived 7 years with me, and who was married from here,  as I wrote you some time ago . Both she and her Husband solicited to go, but I could not think it convenient as Babies might be very inconvenient at Sea, tho they offerd to leave it at Nurse if I would consent to their going, but tho I felt gratified at their regard for me I could not think it would answer. On many accounts a Brother and sister are to be prefered. Thus far have I proceeded  but I know not yet what Ship, or what month or what port I shall embark for, I rather think for  England. I wrote you largely by  Love, who saild for England 3 weeks ago. By him I mentiond a set of Bills which I expected to draw in favour of Uncle Smith for 200 dollors. He did not send me the Bills untill yesterday. Instead of 60 pounds Lawfull, he requested me to sign a Bill for 60 Sterling, as that was just the sum he wanted, and that it would oblige him. I have accordingly drawn for that as I supposed it would not make any great odds with you; whether I drew now; or a month hence, as I suppose I shall have occasion before I embark. You will be so kind as to honour the Bill. I have not heard from you since  arrived. I long to hear how your Health is. Heaven preserve and perfect it. Col. Quincy lies very dangerously ill of the same disorder which proved fatal to my dear and honourd parent. The dr is apprehensive that it will put a period to his life in a few days.  is as well as usual. The thoughts of my going away is a great Grief to her, but I shall leave her with a particular request to my sister Cranch, to pay the same attention to her during her Life, which I have done, and to supply my place to her in sickness and Health. However kind sons may be disposed to be, they cannot be daughters to a Mother. I hope I shall not leave  undone which I ought to do. I would endeavour in the discharge of my duty towards her, to merit from her the same testimony which my own parent gave me, that I was a good kind  considerate child as ever a parent had. However undeserving I may have been of this testimony, it is a dear and valuable Legacy to me and will I hope pruve a stimulous to me, to endeavour after those virtues  [illegible]   which the affection and partiality of a parent asscribed to me.  are well. I hope your young companion is so too. If I should not now be able to write to him, please to tell him I am not unmindfull of him. I have been  to spend a few Hours with our good Uncle Quincy, who keeps much confined a winters and says he misses my two Boys almost as much as I do; for they were very fond of visiting him, and used to go as often as once a week when they lived at home. There is nothing  in the political world. The Cincinati makes a Bustle, and will I think be crushed in its Birth. -- Adieu my dearest Friend.  "
March 15 1784,"My Dearest Friend I have not received a Line from you, nor heard a Syllable Since  yours of November 18th ,  which I have  acknowledged.  I am impatient now, to receive further intelligence from you; and to learn where you are.  Love in the Ship Rossamond, bound to England, must have arrived before this time, by him I trust you have received many Letters from me. I have had but one opportunity of writing since which was by a Vessel bound to  Amsterdam.  In that Letter  I was particular with regard to the manner in which I had adjusted our affairs so as to leave them. Mr. Jones designs to have his vessel ready to sail the latter end of May, and from present prospects I think it most probable that I shall accompany Mr. Jones and his Lady. We have intelligence here, of the fluctuating State of the British Ministry. Whether it bodes well or ill for  America time must determine, it is not a matter of so much Concequence to us, as it has been in times past. The Court of this commonwealth is now sitting. They have taken up the recommendation of Congress Respecting the  and there has been, as you may well suppose, much debateing upon it. And it is generally thought, that the Court will rise, without any thing final taking places Dr. Gorden, it seems has been making use of a private Letter, of yours, to him upon this subjects the contents of which are variously reported. The Committe I am informed who have this matter under consideration, have sent for the Letter, which will speak for itself: I do not feel very anxious with regard to it, Since I think I know your prudence so well, that you would not communicate, to that Gentleman; any private sentiments, which you would be loth should be made publick.  sends me word, Mr. A. has written to judge, such a one --  ""pray desire him to be cautious, he is not his  Friend."" And an other tells me Mr. A. has written a Letter to Mr. Speakers --  ""he is not to be confided in, he has no discretion, he communicates the contents of his Letter to persons who are not to be trusted, he is in a certain Box without knowing it.""  ""And pray,"" I ask these persons,  ""why do you not make use of your own pens to give these cautions, and your reasons for so doing. Why do you not give Mr. A. information respecting those matters which are of importance for him to know?"" ""O I am so perplext and worried with buisness, that I have not time.""  ""Very well sir, these Gentlemen of whom you speak, I suppose have found time to write to Mr. A. One of them I know has. I know Mr. A. has always had a Friendship for that Gentleman, a Friendship of an early date, contracted when they were at Colledge -- and I believe the regard he professes for Mr. A. is Sincere.""  ""I dont pretend to say that it is not, but he wants prudence."" I have not heard any thing from Congress since my last to you; nor can I learn a single step they have taken since. I am now going to write to  for information. Our family is well. Of whom does it consist? Myself and Neice, and two domesticks,  is at Milton. Genll Warren is like to lose his Son Charles, whom they apprehend far gone in a Hectick. Col. Quincy died last week with the disorder which I mentiond to you, he made a donation in his will of a hundred pounds to the Society of Arts and Sciences. The Land you wish to purchase he has given to his Grandsons Samll and Tommas, to be appropriated for the benifit of their education. Mr. Storer is their Gaurdian. They are not yet of age, but I Suppose it will be sold. Dr. Tufts is executor to the Col. and he will take care to procure it when ever it is to be sold. I send this Letter by way of  Lisbon, and beg you to write me by every Opportunity. Yours most tenderly and affectionately "
April 12th. 1784,"My Dearest Friend I hope this will be the last Letter which I shall have occasion to write to you, before I embark for  Europe.  has been urgent with me to embrace the present opportunity and take passage on Board Capt. Calihan, and Captn. Callihan has sent me word that he would wait ten days for me, but I cannot think it prudent to embark untill I hear again from you, which I am daily expecting. Not a line has reachd me from you Since  yours of November   by Mr. Robbins, nor have I heard of you since. I am very anxious to know where you are, and how you do! We have had an uncommon long and severe winter and  the 12 of April it Snows like Janry. All communication Seems to have been cut of for five months past.    [illegible]  by way of  Lisbon, about 3 weeks ago. If I receive letters from you in the course of a few days; I shall embrace the first good opportunity, which offers in May; Mrs. Jones continues in so bad Health that I fear She will never be able to go abroad: there is no prospect of my being able to be accommodated to any place but  London. Mr. Winslow Warren to whom I commit this Letter is a passenger on board ; it would have been agreeable to me to have accompanied him. He appears an amiable modest young Gentleman and I hope will succeed abroad: he is going to fix himself in  Lisbon. Our Friends will lose their 3d son, Charles who is far gone in a Hectick. And now I have adjusted all my affairs and determined upon  out, I summon all my resolution that I may behave with fortitude upon the occasion. The Hope, the Soothing flattering hope of meeting my dearest best Friend rejoiced, and rejoiceing with him, buoys me up, and supports my Spirits in parting with my Dear connexions. I derive a pleasure from the regret of others, a pleasure which perhaps I might never have experienced if I had not been called to quit my Country, the blessing and regret of the poor and the needy, who bewail my going away. The World furnishes us with real objects of Charity where ever we are placed, but the circle around me have been particularly necessitous through this long and severe winter. The real want of employment has multiplied  the necessities of those, who are disposed to industery; and willing to obtain a livelihood by their Labour; and the expence of fire wood through this winter has far exceeded the ability of the widow, and the Fatherless. Much happier should I be if my abilities were such as would enable me to be more extensively usefull; that I might Streatch out my hand to the needy, and manifest the Law of kindness which is written upon my Heart. With regard to  I hardly know what to write you. Our General Court resembles the Parliments of Charles 2d. and James the 2d. By that time it has set a few days, it gets so turbulent that there is no manageing of it. Commutation, taxation, and Tories, set them all in a Flame. You know this people, they will Squable a while but do right in the end, when once they comprehend the whole System and are rightly informd they will submit. We have had our Anual meeting in this Town. The Govenour had the Majority of votes, but many persons at the meeting publickly declared that they voted for him upon no other principal, than that of keeping him in untill an other gentleman should return. I told Some of the persons who mentiond this to me, that however that gentleman might be flatterd by their good opinion of him, yet he would not approve of the principal, upon which they acted.  Since if a better Man was to be had, it was their duty as good citizens to Elect him, without favour or affection to any other. But there is a Town pride as well as a national pride, and they plume themselves that  Braintree has given Birth to such Great Men, that the first Govenour of the common Wealth originated from them, that their foreign minister originated from this Town, and they say; God willing that their second Govenour shall be a Native of this Town too. Who can withstand the Majesty of the people! Our Brother  had the vote here for Senators We hope for a House chosen upon more liberal principals than the last. The passions of the people with regard to refugees are much cooler than they were, and I am ready to think they will attend to the Spirit of the Treaty and perform it with good Faith. But we have Some among us who love to fish in troubled waters, and who are more wroth at being neglected than at the measures of Goverment on any other account. Remember me tenderly to  to whom I wrote by way of  Lisbon. I press our Daughter to write and hope she will. Our Sons I heard are well. A Letter from Charles last week. His Aunt in speaking of him says, he studies as if he considerd the importance of Time. Tom, a Rogue loves his Birds and his Doves, makes bad Lattin and says as he grows older he shall grow wiser. Adieu my dear Friend and believe me  "
"Boston  May 25 1784
","My dearest Friend I came to Town yesterday and have engaged My passage on Board the ship Active , agreable to the advise of my Friends: she will sail in about a fortnight or 3 Weeks and is the only good vessel now going. Mrs. Jones with whom I hoped to have been a passenger is still in so poor Health that there is no prospect of her going very soon and my Uncle Smith upon whose judgment and care I place much dependance advises me by no means to delay my passage. It gives me some pain that I can only hear of you by second hand; and that not since the last of Janry. I find Congress have commissiond the Gentlemen now abroad to transact and form all their commercial Treaties, and Mr. Gerry wishes me to give you the earliest notice; and requests that Mr. Jay may be prevented from returning. There was a trial to add Mr. Jefferson to you, but I cannot learn that it is done. And now my dear Friend let me request you to go to  London some time in july that if it please God to conduct me thither in safety I may have the happiness to meet you there. I am embarking on Board a vessel without any Male Friend connection or acquaintance, my servant excepted, a stranger to the  and every person on Board, a situation which I once thought nothing would tempt me to undertake. But let no person say what they would or would not do, since we are not judges for ourselves untill circumstances call us to act. I am assured that I shall have a state room to myself  and every accommodation and attention that I can wish for. It is said to be a good vessel copper Bottom and an able Captain. Should I arrive I know not where to apply for accommodations. I shall carry with me a Number of Letters and rely upon the Captains care of me.  The United States, Capt. Scot, is not yet arrived tho we are in hourly expectation of it. I hopeto hear from you by her. Tis six months since a single line reachd me from you. All communication seems to be shut out between  Amsterdam and  America. I think after the arrival of the Letters by Capt. Love, that you would write as you would not then look for me untill july. I have given you my reasons for not going with Capt. Callihan. I could get no satisfaction from Mr. Gerry with regard to the movements of Congress untill this month. Our children are all well.  and Tommy are both at home now but will return to  Haverhill next week. The expence attending my voyage will be great I find. The Captns. have got into a method of finding every thing and have from 20 to 25 guineys a person. I shall draw Bills upon you for this purpose but in whose favour I do not yet know. I shall embark with a much lighter Heart if I can receive Letters from you. I dare not trust my self with anticipating the happiness of meeting you; least I should unhappily meet with a bitter alloy. I have to combat my own feelings in leaving my Friends. And I have to combat encourage and Sooth the mind of my young companion whose passions militate with acknowledged duty and judgments I pray Heaven conduct  me in safety and give me a joyful and happy meeting with my long long seperated best Friend and ever dear companion and long absent son to whom my affectionate Regards. I hope to be benefitted by the voyage as my Health has been very infirm and I have just recoverd from a slow fever. I have one anxiety on account of the Maid who attends me. She has never had the small pox. The one I expected to have come with me undertook to get married and dissapointed me. The one I have is a daughter of our Neighbour Feilds and has lived with me ever since Jinny was married. I shall be very happy in two excellent servants. Adieu my dear Friend. Heaven preserve  to each other.  "
"London  july 23. 1784.  Osbornes new family Hotel, Adelphi at Mrs. Shffields No. 6","My dearest Friend At length Heaven be praised I am with  safely landed upon the British Shore after a passage of 30 days from  Boston to  the Downs. We landed at  Deal the 20 instant, rejoiced at any rate to set our feet again upon the land. What is past, and what we sufferd by sickness and fatigue, I will think no more of. It is all done away in the joyfull hope of soon holding to my Bosom the dearest best of Friends. We had 11 passengers. We travelled from  Deal to  London all in pany, and  thrown together by chance, we had a most agreeable Set, 7 Gentlemen all except one, American, and marri'd men, every one of whom strove to render the passage agreeable and pleasant to us. In a more particular manner I feel myself obliged to Mr. Foster who is a part owner of the Ship, a modest kind obliging Man, who  [paid] me every Service in his power, and to a Dr. Clark who Served his  [time] with Dr. Loyd and is now in partnership with him. took a kind charge of Nabby in a most Friendly and Brotherly way shewed us every attention both as a Gentleman physician and sometimes Nurss, for we all stood in great want of both. My Maid unfortunately sick the whole passage, my Man servant was so sometimes, in short for 2 or 3 days the Captain and Dr. who had frequently been to sea before, were the only persons who were not sick. Capt. Lyde is a Son of Neptune, rather rough in his Manners, but a most excellent Sea man, never leaving his deck through passage for one Night. He was very obligeing to me. As I had no particular direction to any Hotel when I first arrived a Gentleman passenger who had formerly been in  London advised me to   [Lows] Hotel in  Covent Garden, where we stoped. My first inquiry  was to find out Mr. Smith, who I presumed could inform me with respect you. Mr. Spear a passenger undertook this inquiry for me, and in than half an hour, both he and Mr. Storer, were with me. They kindly provided lodgings for me to which I removed in the morning, after paying a Guiney and half for tea after I arrived and lodging and Breakfast a coach included to carry me to my lodgings. I am now at lodgings at 34 and 6 pence per week for myself daughter and two servants, my Man servant I left on Board the Ship to come up with it, but it has not yet got up. I drew upon you before I left  America one Bill in favour of Dr. Tufts of an hundred pound Lawfull Money, 98 of which I paid for our passages. This Bill is to be paid to Mr. Elworthy. I drew for two hundred more in favour of Natll. Austin to be paid in  Holland. One hundred and 80 pounds of this money I Shall bring with me to  the Hague as I cannot use it here without loss, it being partly Dollors partly french crowns and French Guineys. Mr. Smith has advised me to this and tells me that what money I have occasion for he can procure me here. My expences in landing travelling and my first Nights entertainment have amounted to 8 Guineys. I had a few english Guineys with me. I shall wish to shelter myself under your wing immediately for the expences frighten me. We shall be dear to you in more senses than one. Mr. Jefferson I left in  Boston going to  Portsmouth where he designd spending a week and then to return to  Newyork to take passage from thence to  France. He urged me to wait his return and go with him to  New York, but my passage was paid on Board Capt. Lyde, the Season of the Year was the best I could wish for, and I had no desire to take Such a journey in the Heat of summer. I thanked him for his politeness, but having taken my measures, I 
Page 3
 I was determined to abide by them. He said Col. Humphries the Secretary to the commercial commission had sailed before he left  Philadelphia, and that he did not doubt I Should find you in  France. I have a Letter from him which I inclose and Several other Letters from your Friends. Mr. Smith thinks Master John will be here to Night from the intelligence he forwarded to you before I arrived. I do not wish to tarry a day here without you, so that if he comes I shall immediately set out, provided I have not to wait for the Ship to come up. How often did I reflect during my voyage upon what I once heard you say, that no object in Nature was more dissagreeable than a Lady at sea. It realy reconciled me to the thought of being without you, for heaven be my witness, in no situation would I be willing to appear thus to you. I will add an observation of my own, that I think no inducement less than that of comeing to the tenderest of Friends could ever prevail with me to cross the ocean, nor do I ever wish to try it but once more. I was otherways very Sick, beside Sea Sickness, but you must not expect to see me pined, for nothing less than death will carry away my flesh, tho I do not think I eat more the whole passage than would have sufficed for one week. My fatigue is in some measure gone of and every hour I am impatient to be with you.    "
 [30 July 1784.],"My dearest Friend I was this day made very happy by the arrival of a  in whom I can trace the strongest likeness of a parent every way dear to me. I had thought before I saw him, that I could not be mistaken in him, but I might have set with him for some time without knowing him. I am at a loss to know what you would wish me to do, as  arrived last week at  Portsmouth, immediately from  Boston, altho he saild a fortnight after me, and went on to  Paris. Some of my Friends suppose that you would rather I should proceed from hence; and agree upon meeting at  Brussels than make the journey first to  the Hague. If I was to follow my own inclinations I should set off next , but our son thinks I cannot come with convenience untill fryday. We have concluded upon this, to wait your replie to these Letters untill this day week, and come to  the Hague or set of for  Paris as you think best, or meet you at any place you may appoint. As to the article of cloathing I am full as much at a loss as you can possibly be. I have bought a Lutestring for myself and Nabby which I have had made, and Nabby is equipt with a  rideing dress, but I thought the fewer I purchased here the better, as I was so soon to go to  Paris, where I suppose it will be necessary to conform to the fashion. If by comeing on first to  the Hague, I could relieve you from any trouble, or render you any assistance, I will most cheerfully perform the journey, but Mr. Storer thinks it will be attended with less trouble and expence; which is a matter worth considering, to proceed with my family to  Paris. The sooner we meet the more agreeable it will be to me, for I cannot patiently bear any circumstance which detains me from the most desirable object  in my estimation that hope has in store for me. I hardly dared flatter myself with the prospect of your comeing for me yourself, and was the less dissapointed when Master John arrived. I shall feel myself perfectly safe under his care. There are many American in this city, most of whom I believe have called upon me, some of whom were quite strangers to me. I have not been to any publick entertainment or even seen the curiositys of the city. I chose to wait yours or my Sons comeing. I have not sent on the Letters which I have for you as they contain no particular intelligence, are mere Letters of Friendship. Nabby has had Letters from  Boston, from  and her Cousin Betsy written only 25 days since. Mr. Tracy came out with Mr. Jefferson. I have two excellent servants  they are not used to the manners and customs of the country, one of whom the maid I am anxious for, never having had the small pox. Dr. Clark would have innoculated her upon her first comeing but I knew not whether we should stay here till she got through it.   "
"Abbe Green, Bath  decem 23 1786
","We arrived here about four oclock a  afternoon, after a very pleasent journey, the weather was somewhat cold, but a clear Sky and a fine Sun Shine was ample compensation. We found convenient apartments, good Beaf mutton and excellent fish for dinner; it was fortunate that we engaged Lodgings before we came, as every House is full, to day being rainy and fogy we have not made any excursion, or looked about us, we wanted a little remit after rising 3 mornings by candle light and riding through the cold. I hope an additional quantity of bed Cloaths will make you comfortable; we had the city musick this morning to wait upon us, and welcome us to Bath, I Suppose we Shall have Some more compliments of the Same kind. I think the Bath road has more of an American appearence than any I have traveld in this Country, the Stone Walls and the Hills and the Towns bearing the Same Names,  Reading  Malborough  Newbury all reminded me of  New England. I think you would have been better pleasd if you had come with us, than you was when you traveld this road formerly, in Summer it must be delightfull, I think very often of your being alone, but whilst the Book lasts you will not want employment, tho you may amusement. Be so good as to let me hear from you, tell me how you do, and direct under cover to Col. Smith at Mr. 5 Abbe Green, but why it is calld so I know not, as it is a Small paved Square and nothing Green to be seen about it. A Good Nights repose to you tho more than a hundred miles distant my thoughts are very often in  Grosveneur Square, and we drink your Health every day. Mr. and Mrs. Smith present their duty.    "
"
december 30th 1786  Bath","My dearest Friend I yesterday received your kind  by Mr. Murry and the day before; yours by Mr. Bridgen,Mr. and Mrs. Rucker left us this morning, but I did not write by them knowing that the post would be much Spedier. You tell me to keep a journal, but you do not think what a task you impose or how every Hour is occupied at this place by those who stay only ten or twelve days, and run the circle of amusement, or rather dissapation, the Young are delighted here, because they feel less restraint in their amusements and pleasures than in the city, the excercise they take, together with the clear Sun Shine and fine air of  Bath tends to exhilirate the Spirits, the aged and the infirm receive Health and Spirits from the Bethsadian pools and not a little Satisfaction is derived to all parties from visiting a place of fashionable resort, as it may be more amusement to you in my absence to read a little detail of my excursion than if I brought home a journal to you, I will endeavour to recollect the events of the past week; you know I had but one acquaintance who resided here, and him I determined to find out and leave a card at his Lodgings, but on Sunday last, before I had made any inquiry for him, he heard of my arrival and came immediately to see me, he was wonderfully polite and civil to us, offerd us every attention in his power. We invited him to dine with us the next day, and the old Gentleman came, he told us that he had not for 3 years past been a Subscriber to any of the publick amusements the concerts excepted, and to that he would have the honour of conducting us. This he did the next Evening and procured us Seats to much advantage, the next day he invited us to a Breakfast with him and entertaind us with great Elegance and Hospitality, he has taken Such a prodigious fancy to Col. Smith that he has made him a confident in his private affairs, Col. Smith brought a letter of introduction to Mr. Fairfax who is Mr. Boylstones most intimate Friend,Mr. Fairfax was Sick confined to his Chamber and his Lady quite an invalide but they have been very obliging to us, Sent us cards for the benifit Ball and yesterday we dinned with them,tho Mr. Fairfax was not able to Set at table, he deputed Mr. Boylstone to do the Honours of it, and the old gentleman appeard as happy as if he had, had So many of his children about him and Mrs. Fairfax Said She had never Seen him in Such Spirits in her Life. In the Evening we went to a party at Miss Hartlys, a musical Route I believe I must call it, as we had both vocal and instrumental, we had Stars and Garters Lords and Ladies present, Miss Hartly is quite a criple having lost one of her feet by a mortification, very infirm, and delicate but quite well bred polite and Soft in her manners, her mind
Page 3
 Seems much more cultivated than most of the Ladies we meet with. She is very fond of Musick and a performer. She is moved about in a chair Set upon wheels, quite helpless her hands excepted. She reads or hears a young companion whom She keeps with her, is very pleasent and cheerfull and was once a very handsome woman. I drank tea with her once before without company and it was then I made my observations. We have been to three Balls one concert one play, two private parties, to the publick walks &c and all this in one week is enough to Surfeit one, the Ball tomorrow Evening will conclude our amusements at  Bath, we then propose a visit to the Hot well of  Bristol, that accomplished we Set out for  Grosvenour Square which we mean to reach on Saturday next, perhaps on fryday, but as it is not convenient for all of us to travel fast; I rather think we Shall make 3 or four days of our return. I have lost my bedfellow to day, but as the weather is so much moderated I think I Shall do without an Abbe the remainder of my Stay. You recollect in  France that they are so polite to the Ladies as to accomodate them with an Abbe, when they give the Gentleman a Nun -- even the Chaste and immaculate Dr, used to take a Nun to his Bed. I am happy at the intelligence  received from  Boston, and hope all will be well.  present their duty; Mr. Cutting writes that he had dinned with you 3 times out of 8 Days, I wish I could Send you some of the fine fish of  Bath in which they greatly excell any part of  England that I have visited, Small Bear Bread mutton and fish are excellent here, but I begin to wish myself at Home notwithstanding, having visited  Bath once I am Satisfied, as you have no fancy for that which makes it so delightfull to most people, I do not wonder that you preferd building up Republicks, and establishing Governments. Be so good as to let John and Esther know that we Shall be at Home on Saturday next.  "
"London May 29 1787
","My dearest Friend I received Mr. Cuttings Letter on Monday morning, and was glad to find you had  short of  Hardwich. I prognosticated from the wind on Saturday that you made your passage by nine or ten on Sunday morning. I commisirated your sickness, and that I might feelingly sympathize with you, used Mr. Hollis's prescription yesterday morning, finding a return of some of my former complaints. The effect proved the necessity of the application. I hope you will be benifited by your journey, but the weather here is not favourable, cold and sour. I fancy it is not mended  [by?] passing over stagnant waters and meddows. Your companion  [however], will I hope exhilirate your spirits by the brilliancy of his fancy. Neptune and the Naides cannot be invoked in vain in their own particular Element. Inclosed you will find a Letter which came last evening. I do not suppose you can do any thing, yet it may be proper you should know the unfortunate situation of the Gentleman. Nothing new has transpired since you left usexcept the Bill which has past making four free ports in the  West Indies,  Kingstone in Jamaica,  St Georges in Grenada,  Mosea in Dominica,  Nassau in New Providence, but till we see the Bill it will be uncertain what benefit  America can derive from it. The Prince of Wales is  with a voilent fever occasiond by over heating himself in dancing at the Dutchess of Gordons Ball on Fryday evening last.  and I are quite solitary and should be more so, if it was not for the young one. Today  we shall have company.  sends Duty to you and compliments to Mr. Cutting. The little fellow smiles assent. Let me hear from you by the next post. I shall be anxious to know how you got over, as well as the state of your Health, in which no one can be equally interested with your ever affectionate Compliments to Mr. Cutting and thanks for his Letter. Since writing the above the  Letter has come in.    Minister Plenipotentiary &c To the care of Messrs. Willinks Amsterdam  "
"London June 7th. 1787
","My Dearest Friend I expected to have heard from you by the last post, but was , only a few lines from Mr. Cutting have come to hand Since you left me.  I wrote you on the 29th. of May , and inclosed two Letters respecting Mr. Barclay. Since that time a Letter from the Frenchs, has arrived, in which they inform you that Mr. Barclay was liberated by applying to the  Parliament of Bordeaux in virtue of his commission to  Moroco, but they make most heavy complaints Stating their case to you, and conceiving it in your power to relieve them. I do not think it prudent to commit the Letter to the post. Mrs. Smith has a Letter from Mr. Smith dated at  Bayonne the 26 of May, he had received a Letter from his Friend Mr. Harrison informing him that Mr. Charmical had procured him Letters, and a passport from the King of Spain, which might facilitate his progress and serve him on his Journey. The News here is that stocks have fallen 5  in concequence of a paragraph ln his Majestys Speach respecting  Holland. The News papers tell us of terible Roits committed by the patriotick party and make one almost anxious for their Friends there. The  of Wales has been most dangerously Sick, has been Bled six times, his disorder a voilent fever which fixd upon his Lungs. The papers tell us that his Royall highness bore his disorder with Christian fortitude; he is better to day. The Monthly Reviewers have made open war upon the  of the American constitutions, and torn it all to peices. ""Ostentatious Display of learning, an embarressed affectation of Elocution. The balances the balances are perpetually rung in our ears like Lord Chesterfields graces, but in all the constitutions here passed in Review before the reader, those of  America and  England not excepted, there is not given a distinct account of the real balancing powers of any State, or the particulars in which the balance consisted. Had the Book been written by a Youth with a veiw to obtain some academical prize we should have said, that if afforded indications of an active mind that gave hope of future acquirements, but that the Young Man too eager to discover the extent of his reading, had carelessly adopted some confused notions of Government and hastily skimmed the Surface of the subject without having taken time to investigate particulars and Sift the matter to the bottom. But we cannot bring ourselves to think that a Man of Dr. Adams's known abilities could possibly be in the same prediciment, for which reason we conclude that he must have some point to carry, some object in view beyond  the Atlantick, with which we are not acquainted. The Book may indeed amuse the ignorant, it may mislead the unwary, but neither can inform nor entertain the phylosopher nor the Man of Letters."" In various parts I thought I  Satans cloven foot, but did not know that any individual was permitted to send in his comments upon a work untill I heard this peice ascribed to that poor envy ridden,contemptable, Ignorant self conceited wretch Silas Dean. This at once disarmed me of my resentment, (for I own it fretted me for one Night so that I did not sleep quietly) and I felt in perfect good humour. I have only given you a small portion of the compliments of which he has been very profuse, and having got his lesson by Heart has retaild it in all companies.Mr. Shippen is my Author. I am very anxious to hear from you, and to know when I may expect your return. The Weather remains very cold here. I hope you find it warmer in Holland. Compliments to Mr. Cutting.  From Your affectionate Just after writing this Letter, yours and Mr. Cuttings was brought me by the post. I was very glad to hear you were well and safe.Mr. Cuttings Letter carried me to  Holland made me sick on board the packet jostled me in the , in short So picturish were his descriptions that I realized them all. The little Boy is well and perks up his Head like a Robbin. His Mamma has had a little of the  Holland disorder bordering upon an ague. My Ladyship is better.

I am so unfortunate as to be confined for several days past with an  in my throat attended with canker and some fever. It is rather abated to day, and I hope is going of. We go on packing, but it is a such more labourious peice of business than I imagind and takes much more time. I hope we shall finish in a few days. The New  Minister was presented at court this week and makes a splendid appearence with his footmen in scarlet and silver and a gay page or running footman was vastly well Received at Court &c. &c.

","My Dearest Friend The Mail is this day arrived, but not a Line have I got from you, nor have I heard a word from you since you left me. I hope you are well. I am anxious to learn when you expect to get back. I find by Letters received yesterday from France that  is gone to meet you, which will render your visit to Holland much pleasenter to you. Callihan does not appear in any great Hurry, and I am full in the Mind that he had rather make it the middle of April before he sails than go sooner. He will not however have to wait for our things, as I hope they will all be on Board this week. I shall Stay in the House as long as I possibly can, but if you do not get back before the 20th imagine I shall be in some Hotell. We have had more winter Since you left  London than the whole Season before, and  Soar throats have been the consequence of the hard March winds. I have had my Share of it I hope, which proved very obstinate for Several days and yesterday was the first of my getting out, Mr. and Mrs. Smith will leave London the 20th. I wrote you by last  Mail under cover to Messieure Willinks. My Most Respectfull  compliments to Mr. Jefferson. I rejoice in the Idea of your having met again before you leave Europe. The papers give us a magnificent amount of preparations in  Holland for celebrating the birth day of the Stadtholder. Nothing   from  America since you left me! I find it very lonesome here and Should be more so if I was not so buisily employd in preparations for our departure. After closing my Letter, yours of March the fourth it just brought me. I rejoice to hear you are well. Compliments to Mr. D. and family. If you had named the  you were at, I Should not be obliged to Send my Letters to Amsterdam.   "
"Bath Hotell March 23 1788
","My Dearest Friend  I received  yours of the 14th  and ever Since  have been in Hourly expectation of seeing you, I hope it is oweing to all the packets being detaind upon this Side, as is reported, and not to any indisposition that your return in delayed. That unpleasing detention is sufficiently mortifying particularly as we wish to proceed to  Falmouth as soon as possible, tho I shall fear to go from hence untill the Spin is gone, for from the best information I can get Callihan has as yet scarcely any thing but our Baggage &c. on Board, and even that has been several days delayd by him. I came last monday Evening to this Hotell, that the Beds and remaining furniture might be sent on Board and the House given up. This will be wholy accomplish'd on the morrow if the weather permits, and has been oweing to that, for several days that all has not been accomplished. The packet arrived this week from   and brings an account that Seven States had accepted the Constitution. The  Massachusetts convention consisted of 300 and 40 members. It was carried by a majority of Nineteen. Georgia and  South Carolina are the two other states of which we had not before any certain accounts.  New Hampshire was sitting.  New York are becomeing more National and Mr. Duer writes Mr. Smith, that he may consider the constitution as accepted, and beginning to operate at the commencement of an other year.  New York had agreed to call a convention. Thus my dear Friend I think we shall return to our Country at a very important period and with more pleasing prospects opening before her than the turbulent scenes which  massachusetts not long since presented. May Wisdom govern her counsels and justice direct her opperations.  set off this week for  Falmouth. She is now confined with a Soar throat, similar to the complaint which afflicted me ten days ago. I write in hopes that the Baron de Lynden will meet you on your return. I shall be exceedingly anxious if I do not see, or hear from you soon.  "
"Hartford  Sunday 16 Novr. 1788
","My Dearest Friend We Reached this place last evening and put up at a Mr. Aves private Lodgings, where we are very well accomodated. I am delighted with the view I have had of this State, the River is in full sight from the House and the fields yet retain their verdure. Lands I am told are valued here at a hundred pounds per acre, and it is not  to let the Farms upon this River st four pounds per annum per acre. Manure is generally carried out in the fall. So much for Farming which is in your own Way, besides I have learnt a New Method of preserving pumpkins which is in my own way. I hope to make the journey usefull to me by further observations. I followd your injunctions Stricktly kept open the windows, walkt some times &c. but still no remedy against evening air. The day's being short and the evenings fine we wisht to improve the good weather and get on our journey as fast as possible, so rode late in the Evening by which means I got a bad cold, or rather added to that which I had when I left Home, it is however going off today. I hope you are relieved from yours and that without the assistance of Bridgham prescription. I think of you very often and how I shall get back to you. I find the weather full cold enough now for travelling with comfort. We have a very easy carriage good carefull driver and able Horses, yet find thirty miles as much as we can accomplish in one day. Some of the Road Rough enough   as you well remember. Our Landlord who is an intelligent man fell into politicks to day, inquired who were talkd of for Senators in our state, &c. but finding no politicians in comapny few observations were made. He was high in praise of Dr. Johnson and Judge Elsworth, hop'd the rest of the States would send as good Men and then he did not believe that the  House of Lords in England could equal them, did no like  pensilvana's sending chusing a Man who had never been heard of before, he might be a good Man, but he wanted thoses Men in office whose Fame had resounded throughout all the States. I ventured to ask him who we talkd of for representatives. He said Col. Wadsworth would be one, but that much had not been said upon the Subject yet. Our Friend Trumble lives within a few doors of this House. I have sent my compliments to him to come and take a dish of Tea with us, the Messenger is not yet returnd. We propose persuing our journey early in the morning and hope to reach  New York by thursday Night. I hope to hear from you by Genll. Knox or Mr. Jarvis, pray see that our son exercises daily. I shall wnat to know a little of , but ofwith them I suppose you will tell me I share no Buisness. I design to be vastly prudent I assure you hear all and say little I hope you will be in good Spirits all the Time I am gone, remembering Solomans advise that a merry Heart was good like a medicine. Love to all my friends. Have had a charming visit from Trumble we were so happy and sociable. I  you had been here to  have shard it, we talkd of Books a little politicks, &c. &c. and so long that, the post is just going, and I have only time to say a good Night and that  I am yours most tenderly Dont leave my Letters upon the table.

"Jamaica  December 3d 1788
","My Dearest Friend  This day three weeks I left Home, Since which I have not heard a word from thence. I wrote you from Hartford and once from this place since my arrival. I cannot give you any account either of New York or Jamaica as I got into the first at Seven in the Evening and left it at Nine the next Morning, and in this place my only excursion has been in the garden. The weather has been bad cloudy and rainy ever since I came  within these two Days, and now it is very cold and Blustering. When I think of the distance I am from Home, the Idea of winter and Snow has double terms for me. I think every Seperation more painfull as I increase in Years. I hope you have found in the Learned and venerable Company you proposed keeping, an ample Compensation for my absence. I imagine however if these cold Nights last a little vital Heat must be wanting. I would recommend to you the Green Baize Gown, and if that will not answer, You recollect the Bear Skin. I hope you will gaurd with all possible precaution against the Riggors of winter, I wish to hear how Mr. John Q A stands this cold. I hope he rest well, and duly excercises. I learn nothing further in politicks for except when Col. Smith goes to Town which is but Seldom, we hear no News and see nobody but the Family. Mrs. Smith remains very well for the Time and young Master grows, but he and William should change Names, as William bears not the least likeness to His Father or Family, and the Young one is very like, for myself I am tolerably a little Homeish. however, the more so perhaps through the fear  of not being able to reach it, just when I wish. If our out of Door Family Should increase in my absence, I hope proper attention will be paid to the preservation of the Young family. If it Should be numerous it will be rather expensive, and I would offer to Your consideration whether two of the young Females had not better be put in a condition for disposal, viz. fatted. The Beaf I Suppose is by this time in the cellar, I wish you would mention to Brisler and to Esther, a constant attention to every thing about House to Gaurd against the incroachment of Rats and mice, the cider Should be drawn off, and my Pears and Apples picked over and repack'd. If I Should not reach Home by Christmass, would it not be best to purchase a pork for winter, and to Secure a few legs of pork to Bacon? I wish amongst other things You would frequently caution them about the fires a Nights. I should be loth to trust any one in this Matter but Brisler. Pray write me by the next post and tell me how You all do. Mr. and Mrs. Smith present their duty. Pray do not forget to present mine to our vanerable parent little William says Grandpa ha. I should certainly bring him home if it was not winter and such a distance. Love to Mrs. Cranch and my Neices. My Trunk has not yet arrived, so that I could not go abroad if I would. Barnard was to Sail the Sunday after I left Town.   "
December 13th 1788,My Dear Friend I hope every post to hear from you but every post has hitherto  me. A Month is a long time to be absent from Home without learning any thing from you. You have often left me and always was very punctual in writing to me. This is but the Second time I have left you and the first that I have been so long without hearing from you. I have written three times before but have very little to entertain you with politicks are confined much to  New york the papers of which give us but little information and winter leaves us very little Scope for Farming or Husbandry. Col. Smith has a fine poultry yard consisting of Turkeys Geese fowls ducks in abundance a pair of very good Horses and two cows two pointers and two water dogs the Island abounds with game and quails partridges ducks and plovers &c. Having tarried till  has got well and about House I am anxious to return Home again. I think I could be more usefull there than here. I should have liked to have spent one week in  N. York but shall not tarry a day for that purpose after an opportunity offers for my return. I beg you would write me by the post. Mrs. Smith desires me to present her duty to you and Love to all her friends. 
"Jamaica  December 17th 1788
","My Dearest Friend It was not  yesterday that I received your Letter and Mrs. Cranchs. Mr. McCormick came up and brought them both to my no small satisfaction, and this was the first that I had heard from Home since I left it, except by the News papers which I have engaged George Storer to forward to me. I have written to you every week since I left you, and subjected you to more postage than any Letters are worth, which I did not know untill Saturday when Mr. Jay offerd to Frank my Letters and requested me to have mine sent to him. Members of congress it seems have not that privilege but when they are upon duty. Mr Jay came out on Saturday to visit me. He had been waiting some Time for Mrs. Jay but the children were sick with the Measles and prevented her. Col Smith was gone to Town, so we had all the Talk to ourselves, and very social we were, just as if we had been acquainted Seven years. He espresst a great desire to see you, and thought you might have come on without subjecting yourself to any observations, tho he knew your Reasons were those of Delicacy. I replied to him that your wish to see him was mutual that a visit from him to you would have made you very happy, but that you was become quite a Farmer and had such a fondness for old professions that you talked of returning to the Bar again. He replied with some warmth, that if your Countrymen permitted it, they would deserve to be brought to the Bar -- that you must   not think of retiring from publick Life, you had received your portion of the bitter things in politicks it was time you should have some of the sweets. I askt him where he thought the Sweets in the new government were to grow. He smiled and said that he hoped for good things under it. I asked him whether the opposition in  Virginia was not likely to become troublesome, particularly when joind by this state. He said it was his opinion that they might be quieted, by the New Governments assureing them that a convention should be called to consider of amendment at a certain period. Col Smith dinned at club on Saturday. Col. Hammilton shew him a Letter from Madison in which he says we consider your Reasons inclusive the Gentleman you have named will certainly have all our votes and interest for vice president but there is interest making amongst the antifeds for Clinton both in  Newyork and  Virginia, and if the Electors should be of that class tis said General Washington will not have the vote of his own State for president. Col. Wadsworth says he is sure of  Connecticut with respect to a vice president. I am rather at a loss to know how to sot. I find there is much inquiry made for me in  Newyork. One Lady is sending to know when I am comeing to Town and an other where I shall keep and Tickets for the assembly have been sent up to me. Mr. Jay requested me to make his House my Home, but I have no maid with me and should experience many difficulties in concequence of it if I went where I should be exposed to so much company and I was previously engaged to Mrs. Atkinson, but my Trunk with all my Cloaths is not yet arrived, and I am sadly 
Page 3
 of, even here having only one gown with me, and I must be obliged to return home without even seeing  Newyork should Barnard be driven off to the  west Indies. If a good snow comes I shall not wait. The Ladies must stay their curiosity till my Levee Day, and if that never comes, they will they will have no further curiosity about seeing A. A. who it seems was of so much concequence or some body connected with her, that at every Inn upon the Road it was made known that I was comeing. I find the price [illegible]   called a Tribute justly paid is in the  N. York and Conneticut papers. I see several political maneuvers in our  Boston papers particularly the Letter which places you a certain Gentleman in the chair dividing the State into two parties one for the Late and the other for the present Governor, and supposing they mean both to unite in Mr. A. An other piece dated at  Braintree, which I am persuaded was never written there I dare say I shall tell you News in out of your own papers.  desires me to present her duty to you. She is very weak yet, but otherways well. Mr. Jay upon seeing william cry'd out well here is grandpappa ever again. He is a fine red checked chubby Boy, as good tempered as I ever saw a child. Mrs. Cranch says you are very Solitary and that she cannot get you to see her. They tell me here that the Great Folks in  Newyork are never solitary. If the wife is absent why they supply her place. Now rather than my Husband should do so I would stick to him, cleave I believe is the proper word  all the days of my Life. I hope the Lads are all well and that Esther takes good care of them and of their things. Mrs. Smith says I am in better Spirits since I got my Letters. I believe it is true. I know I was near home sick before. I think of a thousand things which I ought to be doing, and here I am near 300 miles distant. My Duty to your good Mother. I hope she has recovered from her Fall and is able to visit you sometimes. Pray write me all about the Family and cover your Letters to Mr. Jay.  Adieu most affectionately yours  "
"New York  Janry 12th 1788  [i.e. 1789]
","My dearest Friend I last Wednesday received  yours of Decbr. 28  and should have  by the post of thursday but that the mail for thursday closes on wednesday Evening and does not give time for any replie to Letters which come by that post. I wrote you from this place on Sunday last. At that time I was in hopes I should have been on my journey home before this, as we have every thing in readiness to act out the day that we can get a sufficient quantity of Snow. Col. Smith will bring me home, at all events, even tho I should finally be obliged to come in a carriage which we should be glad to avoid at this season as the Roads are bad, and the Ferries worse for crossing the stages change at the Ferries, and do not cross at this Season.  would even now venture to  Providence by water rather than be dissapointed of her visit but with a young Baby and at this dangerous season of the year Her Friends all disswade her,tho I can sometimes more than half a mind to try it, the expence of taking a coach and sending for me at this uncertain period when it might be detained by Snow before it reachd halfway, would be really too great and I had rather suffer many inconveniences than you should attempt it. Half a foot of snow or less would answer very well, and we have daily reason to however look for it. We have however concluded not to bring William with us, as we imagine he will be much more troublesome than the Baby. This is the Time that I hoped to have been at Home. I know you must be Lonesome and my Boys want looking after or rather their things. I am glad to find that  Massachusetts behaves so well, in this State the Legislature and Senate are at such a varience that it is not expected that there will be any choice at all, and should that  be the case, they have little hopes of keeping Congress here. You judged right with respect to the Sitting of Congress. There is not the least probability of there meeting nor is therethe least any occasion for it, on account of ushering in the New one, for when the New Senate and House some together they chuse a President to receive and count the votes from the different States, and declare the choice. This is said to be the mode pointed out by the constitution. The next post will bring us the choice of conneticut. Since my arrival in Town I have received every mark of politeness and attention from this people which I could have desired. Sir John and Lady Temple were among the first to visit me. I have been to  Mount Montier to a Ball given by him; and to the Assembly. I have  at one place and supped at an other. Sat at table (for suppers I discard),untill I am fully satisfied with dissipating. we have however kept very good Hours, as Mr. Jay is like to have an addition to her Family she is obliged to be circumspect. My own Health is much better this winter than it has been for several years. I attribute it much to my Journey. I want to know how you bear the cold. Last Evening we had a light fall of snow just sufficient to cover the ground but it will all run to day. The clouds are however gathering for more. I hope I shall not have occasion to write again before I see you. My Love to the children and to Brother and Sister Cranch with whom I sympathize under their late affliction. I would write to Sister but hope soon to see her, be so good as to tell John Brisler that he must keep some of the pears untill we come.  Mr. and Mrs. Jay desire their affectionate Regards to you. He is as plain as a Quaker, and as mild as New Milk. Out under all this, an abundance of Rogury in his Eye's. I need to say to you who so well know him, that he possesses an excellent Heart. Mrs. Jay has all the vivacity of a French woman blended with the modesty of an American Lady. Adieu visiters call upon me. I have received and  more than forty visits already.   "
"Braintree  April 22d 1789
","My dearest Friend I received Mr. Bourn's Letter , dated this day week, and I was very happy to Learn of it that you had made so Rapid a progress. I hope you stoped at my old acquaintance Avery's, and that you met with as good entertainment as I had led you to expect. All your Friends rejoiced in the fine weather which attended you. and conceive it, a propitious omen. I enjoyed. the Triumph tho I did not partake the Gale, and perhaps my mind might have been a little Elated upon the Late occasion if I had not have lived Long enough in the world to have seen the fickleness of it, yet to giveit, it's due, it blew from the right point on that Day. Mr. Allen was so polite as to come out to  Braintree  to know if I had any Letters or packages that I wish'd to send forward to you, and that he would take them. I promis'd to forward a Letter and News papers. Mr. A. I presume has business of importance by his return so soon. I hope it is not an office that a friend of yours now holds, and who is in some little anxiety about his own Fate. I received a Letter from him this Evening. I will inclose it by an other opportunity, yet I promised to mention to you what I conceived almost, or quite needless. because I know your Sentiments with respect to him so well, that I was sure you would interest yourself for his continuance in office whatever the System might be. If I have written a little ambiguously you may the more easily guess at the person meant. The Children are now at home.   tells me that the Class which take their degree leave college the 21 of June and that if you have occasion for him he can come on as soon after that day as you wish, that he can have his degree as well as if he was present. He seems to be fond of the thought of getting rid of the parade of commencement. If it would be no injury to him, I should be equally fond of getting rid of a trouble in which there is very little Satisfaction, a good deal of expence and generally many affronts given by omissions. I  it to the Dr. and he approves it. I wrote thus early that I might know your mind upon the subject, you will give me the earliest information respecting prospects. I hope you will be carefull of your Health, and be enabled to go through the arduous task in which you are engaged. I wish to hear from you as often as possible. My Love to Mrs. Smith and children. Let Brisler know that his wife and child are very cleverly, that she is able to Nurse it, and much better than she was before she was confin'd. Mr. Bass moves tomorrow into our House. I have reserved a part of it for Esther if Brisler should continue at New York, and that will obviate the difficulty of being alone in a House. I had the misfortune of loosing one of the young creatures a day or two after you left me by the Horn Sickness. It faild of eating in the morning and before I could get any body to it, it was dead. The Horns were hollow upon inspection but I Suppose your Farm is quite out of your head by this Time and you will only think of it as a departed Friend, and without the  consolation of thinking its Situation better'd, the 20 Trees are all set out, and come in good order.   "
"Braintre  April 26. 1789
","My dearest Friend Major Gibbs Captain Beals and Mr. Woodward all are going to  New York, and all have  Letters, but as they all go at the same Time one Letter must answer. I wrote you this Week by Mr. Allen, since which nothing has transpired in our little village worth communicating. The Newspapers I inclose to you all that I get in the course of a week, but the printers or the persons to whom they are committed, think as you are absent, it is of little concequence whether I get them or not. The Tenant has subsided and a calm has ensued. Caco I see has advertized his Works to be sold in a pamphlet. I wish to know where and how you are accommodated, and what ever else you may think proper to communicate. I have heard only once from you at  Hartford and fear I must wait a week longer before any intelligence reaches me. Pray is it prudent discret or wise, that the Debates of the House should be publish'd in the crude indigested manner in which they appear to be given to the ? Have you seen your little Grandsons ye? How is . I hope she will write me I shall be very lonesome when our Sons are gone to college next week, only I am buisy about the Garden. Tho I have had Time to get very little Done, I have been obliged to have all the wall of the great pasture poled the Sheep became so troublesome and wandered every where, and to day have been building the wall   against Mr. Bass. The Family are well, Esther is tolerable the Baby has a bad  mouth. Pray burn all these scribles for fear you should leave or drop any of them any where. Let me know how you do -- I cannot say I am very well,  better for this fortnight than I was before you went away. I hope your journey will be of Service to you but I fear too much perplexity in Business for you.   "
"Braintree.  May 1, 1789
","My dearest Friend I received  Your kind  of the 19  and  22 of April . The printers were very obliging in taking particular care to supply me daily with the paper, by which I learnt the arriwal and Reception of the President, and vice President, If I thought I could compliment in so courtly and masterly a stile, I would say that the address to the Senate was exactly what it ought to be, neither giving too little, or too much. It has been much admired, yet every one do not see the force of the first part of it; when I read the debates of the House, I could not but be surprized at their permitting them to be open, and thought it would have been a happy circumstance if they could have found a Dr. Johnson for the Editor of them, I think there is much of the old leaven in the New Loaf. ""I dare not lay a duty upon Salt, the people will not bear it, I dread the concequences to the peoples"" is a language to teach the people to rise up in opposition to Government. The people would bear a 5 pr ct duty upon every article imported, and expect as much, but will grumble perhaps at the duty upon Molasses, Be sure it is a little hard for us Yankees who Love it so well and make such liberal use of it. It has already raised the price of it here, I hope the Senate will never consent to draw backs. It will be a constant source of knavary, will not sell duties operate boat, by boat productive and least atrocious? Johnson, whom you know I have lately been reading with great attantion, and have become his great admirer, more fully convinc'd than ever, has he was a very accurate obserwer of Home Life and manners.Johnson in one of his papars proves  that there is no such thing as domestick Greatness. Such is the constitution of the World that much of Life must be spent in the same mannar by the wise and the Ignorant the exalted and the low. Men however distinguished by external accidents or intrinsick qualities, have all the same wants, the same pains, and as far as the Senate are consulted the same pleasures, the petty cares and petty duties are the same in every Station to every understanding, and every hour brings us some occasion on which we all sink to the Common level, We are all naked till we are dressed, and hungry till we are fed. The Generals Triumph and Sages dissertation, end like the Humble Labours of the Smith or plowman in a dinner or a sleep, Let this plead my excuse when I frequently call of your attention from weighty orational objects to the petty concernsof of domestick Life, I hawe been trying to dispose of the Stock on Hand, but no purchaser appears, Immediate profit is what all Seek, or credit, where little is to be given. The weather is cold the Spring backward, and the stock expansive. You will not wonder that I am puzzled what to do, because I am in a Situation which I never was before, Yours I presume cannot be much better. The Bill is settled with 48 18d damages. Vacancy is up and the children have returnd to Cambridge. My best Respects attend  whose health I hope is mended. You do not mention Mrs. Smith or the little Boys, Nor have I heard from them since Mr. Bowen came. By the way I heard a Report yesterday that  Marble Head and  Salem had voted you an annual present of ten Quintals of fish. -- How well founded the Report if I cannot presume to say, Time must determine it, I want to hear how you do and how You can bear the application and confinement of your office, I say nothing about comeing, You will know when it will be proper and give me timely notice. The children desird me to present their duty,  I am my dearest Friend with the tenderest affection ever yours. Esther is very impatient to hear from her Husband, The child is better and She comfortable. Put your Frank Upon your Letters, if you please.  "
"Braintree  May 5th 1789
","My dearest Friend Mr. Dawes sent me word that he was going to  New York this week, I would not omit any opportunity of writing to You,  I know I must sometimes perplex You with domestick matters. I would not do it, but that I wish your advice and direction. I wrote you in my last that the Wall was  between Mr. Bass and You, and Barley had been sown. The Hill before the window. Your Brother has had cleard of Stones, and gatherd up the overpluss manure and laid where directed. I requested him to dispose of the Young Stock if he could, but he has not been able to. I procured a load of Salt Hay for the Stock . Since you went away pay'd Thayer 6.12s.11d for the Hay I had of him, and this day am obliged to purchase more English Hay. The Wall upon the Hill was poled agreeable to your direction and the sheep put there and Hay given them, but the season is so backward and the flock so large that they are pinch'd. The Dr. had agreed to take off this week 3 Heffers and the 10 weathers and pay the childrens Quarter Bills which amounts to Sixteen pounds. Thus two anxieties I am relieved from. But Your Brother upon clearing this Hill insists upon it, that it is trod down so hard by the cattle that it will provide no grass this year and the best thing which can be done with it, is to plow it up. To this I could give no consent, knowing how averse you were to any such thing, but yesterday hearing that a Tax Bill was combing out this Month, he got quite discouraged and came to tell me that he would not have any thing to do with the place for that he should never get sufficient of from it, to pay the Taxes. I offered him a part of the Sheep, that he should take 20 and leave half the profits of them, Lambs and wool this Year, or I would do any thing reasonable that he should desire. As I had not been abl to part with the oxen, French should help cart out the manure but he was sure that you would think he might make so much more than it was possible for him to, that you certainly set him down for Knave or Fool, and he would hade no further concern with it, unless it was to render me any assistance. I hope however he will consider further about it. In the mean Time I wish You would write to him, or me; the manner in which Glove has Balsas place is I suppose a reason with him for thinking that he cannot take this answer. I have got Fibril to work with French and must get the Manure upon the Grass as soon as possible. I will exert myself to the best of my ability, but it really worried me so much that I could not Sleep last Night. The Cows have not calf'd yet, and really every thing seem'd to have gone wrong. Veal has got to two pence pr pound,Spear brought me a Parish Rate this week of three pounds 26 Shilling and Eleven pence and yesterday Col. Thayer sent a deed of the Woodland. As You were always Remarkable at a difficult case, I wish you would direct me what to do with those which at present surround me. Pray burn all my Letters. I Suppose you are  with National difficulties which well puzzel You as much as my domestick affairs do me. It is hard to have both. I have not heard from You since the  22d of April . We are well as usual.  Yours affectionately "
May 6th 1789,"Brisler  arrived last Evening and brought  yours of May the 1st . I have not time to notice all I want to in it. I wish to know whether you would like that I should engage Daniel as coachman who drove you to  New York when you get to House keeping, and what are the wages given. Tom we can never keep if we wish for peace. would not the House out of Town be most agreeable to you and most for your Health? You mistook me if you thought I meant to bring  Tommy. He will  [be] at Colledge till the middle of July, tis only the Class who [ . . . ]  their degree that can leave college in june and the president must be written to for the purpose. You did not write me as if you had thought maturely upon it. I would not wish to do any thing without your free consent and advise. My Letter is waited for. Compliments to  who with your permission is a great favorite of mine to Mrs. L  [illegible]   "
"Braintree  May 7th Fast day
","My dearest Friend Our parson has been praying for you  that you may be enabled to discharge the high and important Trust, committed to you with equal integrity and abilitis as you have heretofore excercised in Negotiations at Foreign courts and embassies abroad, and with equal Benefit and Satisfaction to your Country. I have been reading with attention the various addresses to the president and his replies. They are all pathetick but none more so than that to the citizens of Alexandria. Throughout all of them he appears to be most sensibly affected with the Supreme and over ruling providence which has calld him to Rule over this great people rather to feel Humble than Elated, and to be overpowered with the weight and Magnitude of his Trust, who that reflected, who that weighed and considerd but must lay his Hand upon his Breast, and say what am I that this great Trust is committed to me? Your Legislature are promulgating a perfectly New Doctrine. I had always supposed that in point of Rank the Senate were Superiour to the Representatives. This perfect equality brought to my mind a story told of Johnson, that dining one day with Mrs. Macauley she was conversing upon her favorite topick of the Natural equality of Mrs. Johnson heard her very gravely, after some time he rose from the table and bowing very respectfully to the Servant who waited behind his chair, pray Mr. John, take my place and let me wait in my Turn, you hear what your mistress says; that we are all equal -- there debates as given to the publick do not prove them all Solomons, forgive me if I am too Sousy -- tis only to you that I think thus freely. I shall not forward the papers of this week they contain nothing more than what you have already had. I hope it will not be long before you will be able to take  a House, living upon a Friend cannot be long agreable to you I know and now John is away I fear you will suffer some inconvenience. I cannot prepare my things for Removal untill I hear further from you, but I should suppose it would be best to get Mr. Tufts vessel to take them either here or at Weymouth. If there are any Number of Books that you would wish for I will have them packed and ready if you can point them out. With regard to the Horse I should be very glad that our Son might have him, but upon maxims of prudence will it do at this time? I need not give my reasons for the Question, French must be paid before I leave home, there are Six Months wages due to Brisler on the first of May, which he will have occasion to leave with his wife, and to purchase some articles of furniture. I shall be obliged to pay for what work has been done by your Brothers hands upon the place, an expence I would not have incured if I had supposed he would not have kept the place. You wish to give a look at your Farm, the Hills begin to look green, but the Season is so backward that scarcely a Tree has leaved Lilack excepted. 3 hands with a Team were all yesterday employ'd in picking up the stones, andthrown out of the ditches and carried upon Quincy medow in the Manure. I could have wished more Manure might have been put there, attempted it but found it would out the ground to peices. Tomorrow will be employd in carrying on the Manure behind the House, and cleaning the ground of Stones. The Sheep have gone very quiet since the wall was poled the Weathers excepted whom no fence would hold butthem they are parted with. Shall I do all the work necessary upon the place for the present, and at my leaving it request your Brother to take it, he paying one third of the taxes upon it, or shall I leave it to him to say upon what terms he will look after it. Mr. Baxter very kindly sent me word yesterday that he would hire it for four years but I asked no Questions, presuming you had rather it should lie un 
Page 3
 unimproved. Your Son Tom says if he was out of college he would come and live with Pheby and Abdee and improve it himself before it should go a beging thus. One of your Townsmen told me the other day that he was very sorry you was gone away, for there was no body left in town to buy Land.  All your Friends desire to be affectionately remembered to you, but none more tenderly than your ever affectionate Compliment to Miss Livingstone and all the Ladies who so kindly inquire after your Friend  "
"Braintree  May 16 1789
","My dearest Friend I yesterday received  yours of May the 3d  by Captain Balsas in which you request that I would come on .  Yours of May the first  mentions several articles which you suppose it will be necessary for the to send forward, but add all is as yet uncertain, so that I am in doubt what to do, particularly as I nave laid before you since, a state of my difficulties to which I could have wisht some replie, that I might have known how to proceed agreeable to your wishes; I cannot get your Brother to say upon what Terms he will take the place, he insists upon it that all that can be got from it this year will not more than pay the Taxes, and as a proof he brought me this afternoon a Tax for the high way of Two pounds Nine Shillings this added to the Parish Tax makes five pounds Eighteen shillings, this added to the Tax we have already paid makes Sixty Dollars, but I know very well that if he improved it, they would not tax it so high and then a part of this is for woodland. Mr. Black complains most bitterly, his Taxes are just double. I have not contracted any debts to the amount of a dollar since you left me, two articles only I have been sole to part with, (excepting what the Dr. took,) a Hog and a Calf, the proceeds of which I was obliged to lay out in Hay for the stock and to send to a distant part of Weymouth for it, they ask 3 Shillings pr. Hundred. Captain Balsas is obliged to go to  Boston to buy Hay, there has not been such a demand for these several years. Mr. Black is obliged to Buy, the pastures are quite Bare, and the vegatation very Slow and the weather very cold. I do not think I shall be able to get to you in less than three weeks from this time, and how I shall then be able to leave our affairs is uncertain. No offer of any sort has been made for the oxen. Your Brother thinks they had better be sent upon an Island to fat, the must lie where it is, for I cannot get any Sale for it, the Horse I have but upon sale at 80 dollars, but your Brother says I may think myself very well of, to get 70. If I understood Brisler right. you said he should be given to JQA rather then parted with at less. Barnard arrived this week, and I sent Brisler to Town immediately for the Trees. They are much smaller than the  Rhoad Island Greenings, all of which appear to have taken and are very fine Trees. I have got them all set and properly guarded so that I hope we shall have an additional quantity of good Fruit. I have yet got some Russets as fair as when they came from the Trees. Your Mother is as well as usual and yesterday with our Horse and chaise undertook a ride to  Abington where she proposes to spend a fortnight. I have not been from Home but one half day since you left me. Esther was confined and I have had nobody but Polly with me, and I have had my Hands full of Spring work for my children untill Louisa came about a week ago to make me a visit. I find her so helpfull to me that I shall keep her till I come on. I do not like to sleep alone I am so subject to those Nervous affections, that I am some times allarmed with them. With respect to a House. I rather wish you to take one before I come on. Mrs. Smith can judge as well as I can, but whether you do or no, I will endeavour to be with you 
Page 3
 in the course of three weeks from this Time. If you can possibly get time I wish you would say whether I must bring Linnen China glass kitchen furniture plate, looking glasses I would not remove and Beds if I leave any in the House I can take only three or rather I should have said, if I left enough to accommodate us when we come home to see how our Trees grow &c. The Hill begins to look finely and the Garden much better for New setting what Box I have taken up, but it is like diging up so many Trees with large Roots, and I believe to speak within Moderate Bounds, it would take a Gardener a Month to do it properly. Thayer is chosen Rep. again. The Shaiseites were very low. Vinton had only one vote,General Lincoln is chosen for  Hingham. Judge Sergant and Lady kept  with me on their way to  Barnstable Court, and desired to be affectionately remembered to you. Judge Cushing has visited me twice. Your Book is his Travelling Companion he says. but he could not possibly part with it yet. I have requested him to deliver it to Mr. Cranch if I should be absent when he comes again. Is Mrs. Washington arrived yet? I wish she would get there before me. I dont very well like all I see in the papers. Pray write to me by the next post after you receive this Letter, the printers have sent the papers to you they say, so that I have lost sight of several of them this week. All Friends desire to be remembered to you.  Most affectionately yours  "
"Braintree  May 26 1789
","My dearest Friend I hope Barnard has arrived with the things which I sent by him. If there is any person in the House they had better be sent immediately to it there to lie  I arrive. On the Recept of  your Letter May 3d  I sent directly to Town and finding Barnard almost ready to Sail I got him to take as many things as I could get ready. They are carpets linnen &c. After I had done this I sat out to visit my Sister at  Haverhill, leaving word that I would have any letter which should come in my absence sent to me. Two days after I left Home I received  yours of May 13  and  14th . If I had been at Home I should immediately have gone about packing some part of my furniture, but today Mr. Ward deliverd me  your Letter of May 18th . I am glad you have determined to proceed no further then taking a House untill you know upon what terms we are to put our selves in motion. Tho I was only absent a week from home I was so uneasy after I received your Letters in which you desired me to come on (directly, least you should think I made an unnecessary delay) that the pleasure of my visit was much diminished, yet I knew Mr. Tufts vessel was not returnd and that I must wait the return of Barnard before I a could possibly send any thing further. It is very unpleasent Idea to me, to be obliged to pull down and pack furniture which has already sufferd so much by Removal just as I have got it well arranged. It is no trifling affair and will require no very short time to accomplish. If you please it must be done: I will only take such things as will enable us to keep House for the present, if our Masters will please to furnish us two Rooms in a proper manner I can put up sufficient for the remainder of the House, but as I know not how to take any steps at present I shall let every thing remain in quiet, but for me to come to  N. York with Charles and one or two domesticks, before I can go to House keeping would only tend to embarrass us all. and though I know your Situation must be painfull and disagreable to you, I fear I should only increase rather then lessen your difficulties. I would wish to know if I do not ask an improper thing, whether you would be willing I should bring Louisa with me. I find her so usefull with her needle, at any House work at the Ironing Board, that I think she would be to me a very great assistance, but at the same time if you are not intirely willing, or have the least objection, I shall not repeat my request. She has two qualities which you value -- silence and modesty. Mr. Allen brought  your Letter of May 19th . I found it this Evening upon my return. Captain Brown is the Captain  with whom Brisler camehome and with him he has desired me to go, as he has a great opinion of his civility.Daniel I found was married and in a pretty way of Business so I have not said any thing to him. I shall be obliged to send the Horse to JQA. I cannot get any offer for him,tho I have sent to Ballard and to Bracket. Several Gentlemen have lookd at  him, but he is known in Town to have broken a chaise for woodard all to pieces, a circumstance I never knew untill I offerd him for sale. I could have disposed of him but for that circumstance and his being too Headstrong for Ladies to manage. Our Son Says it will cost him this summer as much to hire Horses to attend court as the keeping that horse will amount to, but I tell him he must sell him if he can. The president has  [illegible]   received both your Letters and will ask consent of the Corporation for Charles, he has a French oration given him for his part at commencement. The president and Lady have sent me word that they design to visit me on Saturday next and dine with me. Our good Friends Judge Dana and Lady kept Sabbeth with me on their way to  Plimouth court. It grieved me to see him in such ill Health. I found him better on my return from  Haverhill. I lodged at his House. I came through Town and dined at Dr. Welchs, where I met with Dr. Pearson, who was very full with his remarks upon the answer of the House to the president. He was much disgusted with the manner and stile of it. ""This is what we have Thought fit to address to you"" was the Language of Superiours to an inferiour. Stiling him fellow citizen, was in his opinion very improper, he was no more their fellow citizen whilst he was president of the  united States, than the King of G. B. was fellow Subject to his people. I read the debates of the House and I have watched a certain character much celebrated, and from the whole I have drawn up this conclusion, that he either does not posses so great talents as he has been said too, or 
Page 4
 he is aiming at popularity, at the expence of his judgment and understanding. Honestus, pronounces Mr. Madison the wisest and best man in the House, but time will unveil characters. I do not like his politicks, nor the Narrow jealousy he has discovered. I have an opportunity of Sending this Letter written in great haste as you will perceive.  is Barnards Receit "
" Sunday  May 31 1789
","My Dearest Friend I received   your Letter of May the 24th  and shall begin tomorrow to get such things in readiness as will enable us to keep House. I feel a reluctance at Striping this wholy at present, because I am well persuaded that we shall in some future period if our lives are prolonged return to it, and even supposing a Summer recess, we might wish to come and spend a few months here. An other reason is, that I do not wish to bring all our own furniture, because congress are not, or do not possess sufficient Stability to be sure of continuing long in any one State. I am fully satisfied with the House you have taken and glad that it is a little removed from the city. The advantages will overbalance the inconvenience I doubt not. I suppose Barnard has arrived before this, would it not be best to let him know that he will have a full freight ready, returns as soon as he will, and that I must look out for some other vessel if he delays.tho I have not the least prospect of getting one, for Dr. Tufts is yet at  New York. Barnard's is calculated for the Business and I could get a Small vessel to come here to Mr. Blacks and take in my things and carry them along Side of Barnard, which will be less expence and damage than carting them to  Boston. In the mean time I will get the Dr. to look out, and see if any other vessel can be hired for the purpose provided Barnard should delay at  New York. This you can advise me of by the next post. With the greatest expedition I do not think I can get them ready under a week. I must leave Brisler to come by water with them, if you think it is best for me to come before my furniture is ship'd, but I do not see what advantage I can be of, to you situated as you are, an additional incumberence   to Mr. Jays family would be still more indelicat than imposing the vice president upon him for several months, and rendering his situation so delicate that he could neither leave him with decency, or stay with decorum, and to be at  Jamaica I could do no more than if I was at  Braintree to assist in any thing. -- The Trunks which I sent contain Bed and table Linnen some Cloths and the cases contain carpets. I will however be directed wholy by your wishes and come next week if you think it best, and you have any place to put me. You must be sensible from the tenor of your Letters that I have not known hitherto known what to do, any more than you have from your Situation, what to direct. You will be as patient as possible and rest assured that I will do my utmost with the means I have, to expedite any thing. As to insurence there will be no occasion for it by Barnard who is so well acquainted with the coast, and at this Season of the year. The president and Lady  with me yesterday. He has got permission for Charles's absence.Polly Tailor would cry a week if I did not bring her, for a House maid I know not where I could get her equal. Elijah's Mother thinks it is too far for her Son to go, but if they consent Mr. Brisler can take him on Board Barnard when he comes, but I shall not press it. Poor Daniel has been sick with Soar which gatherd in his Throat and which nearly proved fatal to him. He expected from you some gratuity for himself, oweing to the multiplicity of cares which on all sides surrounded you, at that time, it was omitted, as it was Customary and Daniels expectations were dissapointed, he mentiond it to one or two persons, amongst whom woodard was one, who having just returned from  New York, clapt his hands to his pocket and taking out two crowns gave them to him, telling him that you was so much engaged at the time, that it had slipt your mind,  but that he saw you at  New York and that he had brought them for him. This came to my knowledge by the way of Mr. Wibird who insisted upon letting me know it. I immediately repaid Mr. Woodard and thank'd him for his kindness. Your Brother I believe will take care of the place when I leave it. The leave for Breaking up the Hill came too late for this Season, the weather is remarkably cold and Backward, the pastures bare and vegetation very slow. There is a fine blow upon the place, and if the frost last week which  beans, has not yet injurd the Blossom, we shall have afinelarge crop of fruit. I had yesterday a fine plate of fair Russets upon the table, sound as when they were taken from the Trees. My Garden looks charmingly but it wants warmth. I have got some large asparagrass Beds made, and my little grass plots before the door, pay well for the manure which I had put on. In short I regret leaving it. Your Mother is well as usual, her Eyes are very troublesome to her. You will let me hear from you by the next post. I hope to be able to relieve you soon from domestick cares and anxieties, at least my best endeavours shall not be wanting. I know you will want your own Bed and pillows, your Hot coffe and your full portion of [illegible]  where habit has become Natural. How many of these little matters, make up a large portion of our happiness and content, and the more of public cares and perplexities that you are surrounded with, the more necessary these alleviations our blessings are sometimes enhanced to us, by feeling the want of them, as one of that Number it is my highest ambition to be estimated, and shall be my constant endeavour to prove in all situations and circumstances  "
"Braintree  June 7th. 1789
","My dearest Friend  I this day received the Federal ,tho I got no Letter from you. I was in hopes to have heard this week in replie to what I wrote on Sunday last. Since that time Mr. Smith has been in treaty for me, with two  Conneticut Sloops one of which demanded 50 pounds freight for 2 thirds of his vessel, the other 40. Each of them were about 70 Tons. He then applied to Blagett,Barnards owner and has agreed with him for 33 pounds for the whole of the hole of the vessel, and if I do not fill her a deduction to be made. It has already taken me a thousand of Boards besides the Boxes which were not broken up, to case what furniture I propose bringing.Brisler has done it all heitherto, I shall be ready for Barnard by the middle of the week, and his owner has engaged that he shall Sail as soon as he is ready tho I shall not pretend to bring Some of my best furniture. What I have put up will be fully adequate to the provision voted, which I think is a thousand Dollors less than has been given to Secretaries which have been sent abroad, but perhaps I See only in part. I enclose you a memorandum of expenses to which I am in part knowing. Many others you must already have incur'ed, and can fill up the Blanks better than I presume they do not mean that house rent is to be included  in this estimate. Not one single Step so that House take without discovering the greatest jealousy of the Senate, who before ever heard of putting the two Houses upon a par? I think Sir I have never petitioned for any office, for any Relation of mine, Mr. Small Tufts of   was formerly in an office which he discharged with fidelity to the publick. Mr. Dalton can inform you whether, it was Naval officer or collector of impost and excise; I am not certain which, but his character as an honest industerous capable man will not be disputed, and perhaps it may not be thought amiss to bring him forward again. Our season is very dry and the prospect of a good crop very . You have not once told me how your Health is, our Friends are all well as usual. I shall write you again as soon as I hear from you.

","My dearest Friend  I last Evening received  Your Letter of June 7th . I will Set of on Wednesday for  Providence and embark in the first packet for  New York, pray get an oz. of Glober Salts and half oz. Manna and take imediately, an oz. of antimonial wine and take 30 drops three times a day. I will be with you however as soon as possible. Barnard got in on , we had two days of voilent and incessant Rain, which tho much wanted, prevented him from unloading his Grain, he has promised me that he will be ready to take my things on Board by Wednesday, they are now nearly all ready, and I shall leave Brisler to finish and get them on Board, I and my Neice have gone through the package of every Brittle article, and I think have made them Secure. I presume there will be more than an hundred packages. When I think of the  we have formerly been at in casing and packing these same articles I find it now a very triffel in comparison, tho be Sure I have not taken near all my things, and a Small part only of the Books, but we have gone through it all with our own hands. We have orderd it thus. We have launchd the Scow and mean to put all the things into it at different times and Barnard is to come up to the Mouth of   the creek by Mr. Blacks and take them on Board, I have done the best in my power with every thing here, but that best is not so much to my Satisfaction as I could wish. We will  to do every thing that falls to our Share with as much calmness and composure as possible,andlet Sail over the Rocks and Shoals with as much Safety as we can, happy if we Split neither upon the one, or founder upon the other.

She has been learning to dress Hair of Mrs. Brisler and She will take a great deal of care of me buy her needle work, and indeed every kind of attention that She can pay either to you or to me, her temper is perfectly mild, and I think her every Way a good child. Adieu my dearest Friend. Pray take care of Your Health. I Shall consult Dr. Tufts and take his advice. My Head and Hands are so full of Buisness that I Scarcly know what I have written.

","My dearest Friend I Yesterday received you kind  dated at  Fairfield and am happy to find that you had advanced thus far With no greater inconvenience than Rocky Roads and a Blundering Servant, I will take better care of his Horses than he appears to have done of his Master, for the old proverb was never more verified What is every bodys buisiness, is nobodys buisness, than in Roberts going of without Your Bagage. But he was still more culpable, to leave a part of it at  Kings Bridge when it was sent on to him, Your Shoes and Night Cap were brought back by Col. Smith When he returnd Home, I presume the President will overtake You on the Road.  [ . . . ]  he sat of on Thursday, He went in his chariot alone, and his two  [secretaries] on horseback. You recollect What past the Saturday evening when You took leave of him, On Sunday he exprest himself anxious So Mr. Lear least he had not been sufficiently urgent with You to accompany him, and desired him to come out to you, Mr. Lear in reply observed that if he came out, it was probably that you would think yourself not at liberty to refuse, and that it might break in upon Your own arrangments. He will I fancy send you an invitation to accompany him to  Portsmouth which I hope You will find it convenient to accept. I went in to Town on Saturday and brought out Miss Custos, and in the afternoon Mrs. Washington and Mr. Nelson and Lewis came out and drank Tea with me, This morning Mrs. W. sent out her Servant to request that the Family would come in and dine With her to day and this being the last concert, that we should go together to it.  This we comply with as you Will readily suppose. Col. Smith Major Butler Mr. String Webb, Platt, Lawrance &c, are all gone to  Long Island on a Grounding Party. Our Family are better than for a week past, Two days after you went away,George the footman was  with a Plurity Fever and that to so high a degree that I was obliged to have his bled Blisterd &c, in the course of a few hours, but taking it immediatly, he is on the Recovery. But every person in the family have had the Epidemick disorder which has so generally prevaild in a greater or lesser degree, As to Small Pox neither Louissa or John have had it, the Dr. says oweing to their being sick with this disorder, and that two disorders Will not opperate at the same time, but I fancy much more owing to the Matters not being good. The last Post brought You a Letter from our Friend Mr. Hollis dated in June. He makes many complaints and is much grieved at not having heard  from You.  [ . . . ]  but on 2d thought I will inclose You the Letter that you may write to him. There is also a Letter from the Dr. in which he request to know what Quantity of cheese we shall want. Perhaps You would like that made under Your Mothers care best, all the buttar that can be procured from either place some of the Russet Apples the Pears,  N. York cannot Shew the like, Hams &c.  is very Steady to the office in the day and to his own Room in the Evening, My duty to Mother Love to Brothers and Sisters Nephews and Neices, Let me hear from You as often as you possibly can, I rejoice in the fine weather You have and hope Your Journey will prove highly benificial to Your Health, I wish that a visit from the President may tend to conciliate the minds of our Nothern Countrymen and that they will lay asside all Sedition and  evil speaking. A peice Signed a centinal in Edds paper of last week dated  Philadelphia, but I believe written in  Boston is worthy Notice, might be call'd Treason against the Government. It is very seditious.

","My dearest Friend I presume You have   Braintree before this day, I hope the Sight of Your Friends and of Your Farm has restored Your Health and Spirits, You did well to flee before the very sickly period. Mr. Maddison lies very ill at  Philadelphia, and it is reported that the Speaker of the House died last week by the Burating a Blood Vessell in this Epidemick cold, which scarcly one escapes, I hope however the report may not be true, as I have not seen any mention of it in the papers. Count Montier and family saild last week as silently as possible. No mention of them in the papers, or other notice taken. Every thing appears perfectly quiet and easy.  Boston papers only are seditious. I think from the complexion of some peices Which I read in them that  Massachusetts with is brewing mischief,  is a letter, which I wish You to answer immediatly, I have received the fish in four Boxes and tried some of it, which proves very fine, One Box I have sent to Mr. Jay as a present from You, Our Family areis better than whan I wrote You last, little John adapted who is very sick cutting his Eye teeth. If Brisler is at  Braintree Would not You Wish him to Bottle the Sherry Wine which We used part of, and pack it for this place, The other cask I would not remove. I Wish to hear from You and from the children, Mrs. Cranch wrote me that John was Very unwell with his cold, It was taken here I believe, and he ought to be attentive to it.

","My dearest Friend I did not write to you by the last post. I was in hopes to have received a Letter from you and to have known from under your own Hand how your Health was.  [illegible]   wrote me by your direction, and I heard by other Hands of your safe arrival and the News papers inform us that by desire of his Honour the Govenour you was in the procession to accompany the president to his Residence. There is a vile mischevious junto in  Boston, but I shall lose the whole chain. The printers have not sent on the papers since you left here; pray order them continued. But now with regard to our own affairs Brisler sends me word that he proposes to return and bring on his Family, and I have engaged two Rooms for him in the House at the End of our Land, adjoining to the corn Field which will be very near and convenient for him. I am not at all satisfied with the Hand I have with me and with Regard to the coachman, you will not confide in him further than you can see him. Brisler will tell you that with Liquers he cannot be trusted. I mention this least Brisler should be obliged to come away before you. The Porter which is in the cellar you will either have sent on, or dispose of as it will freeze. The red wine and any other you chuse you will direct Brisler to put on Board Barnard, 200 weight of cheese and all the butter which can be procured. I hope you will conclude to return sooner than you talkd of, the Trunks of cloaths which you had sent by Bernard you can leave without any inconvenience till Spring. We have no News here except the expected return of the commissioners from  Georgia who it seems have been very , and concequently must expect many unfavourable reports with respect to them, some of which are already in circulation. The District court meet this day. The Marshall is qualified and attends. The Rank and presidence was yesterday settl'd and the Marshal is to take Rank of the district Attorney.

Novbr. 10th 1789,"My Dearest Friend Tis more than a month since you left Home, and except the few lines from  Fairfield, I have not received a single Letter from you. I have written to you every week, and should have been very happy to have  from your own Hand that you was benefited by your journey and that you was conveniently accommodated. I get only one  Boston paper, so that I am in the dark with regard to the politicks of  Massa. save what is retaild here.  received Letters from Mr. Jefferson yesterday dated 5 August.

The  is gone to serve a writt this morning upon a captain of a vessel who has defrauded the customs. It is the first which has been issued and it runs in the Name of the People. He thinks that there is a difficulty arising with respect to the prisons. A marshal is obliged to give Bonds and committ his prisoner to the Jails of the State and into the custody of officers over whom the Federal court has no control, who will bear him harmless if the prisoner excapes? The weather is remarkably fine. I have got the chief of  our winter wood, but at a most terrible price the oak cost 326 pr cord, and walnut 50.  It shall be the last time that I will be so taken in by dependance upon others. The Carman found he could not make money enough by getting it, and so would not stand to his agreement. If Barnard is not saild pray tell Brisler to Buy me 30 or 40 dozen of Eggs and put on Board. They have got them up to 1/6 pr dozen. Butter a shilling pr pound by the firkin. It really would have been worth while to have brought our vegetables in Boston. Potatoes particularly for they are at 9 shilling a Bushel by the Quantity, turnips at 1/6.

The president got home on fryday last. Looks much fatigued with his journey, and has beat out all his Horses. Brisler says the Roads are getting very bad, and that you will find it very tedious travelling in a few weeks. Pray take care that your little vehicle does not overset. I wrote you respecting several articles which I supposed might come with Barnard, but my letters will be too late unless we venture them when he comes again. Charles wants to have some cider sent, and I think half a dozen Barrels would no be amiss. I wish Brother would get me 20 or 30 dozen of Eggs put into Brand and send me when Barnard returns. We are all well cold accepted. I believe Louisa has the small pox. She has had some symptoms, but no Eruption worth mentioning and not one that has fill'd.

","My Dearest Friend  Such has been the Weather since you left me, that I cannot form any accurate judgment where you now are. I Sometimes conjecture that You are not farther than  Brookfield. At any rate you must have had an  week, tho perhaps not So Severe a Snowstorm as we have had here. Monday afternoon and all twesday it raind then cleard up very cold and blustering, on fryday came on a Snow Storm wind very voilent at North East. It continued so through fryday Night and Saturday even untill Sunday morning, when the Snow was over the tops of the Stone wall and so Bank'd that no wheel carriage can Stir, we had not any meeting to day, and Some person had their Sheep to digg out from under the Snow Banks. Ours very fortunately experienced the comfort of their new habitation. The Hay was housed on fryday, and bedding provided for the Horses, but the  [illegible]  Boat is not carried to the Island. After the Storm of twesday Shaw and Firril went to see if She could be got of, but the very high Tide had thrown her up so high that they pronounced it impossible untill the Tides rose again, and that it would be more adviseable to turn her over where She now is, and Secure her than for the winter, this Snow Storm confirms them in the opinion. I never remember so Severe a  in November. I hope to hear from you this week. I have felt much anxiety for You, more perhaps than if I had been a fellow traveller with you. With Books about me I have felt dismal and Lonely. You left the only ones you intended to take; and an Inn seldom furnishes any entertainment of a literary kind, I hope Brisler minds to have a fire in your Bed Room and that your Sheets are well aird and your Bed well cloathd, remind him of this injunction. Yet I know not whether this will reach you Soon enough to put it in practise. Porter who was to cut our Wood and Timber is confind to his Bed with the Rhumatism. Most families I find are caught without wood, so that it is to be hoped they will turn out and make roads. I think you will find it necessary to take a Sleigh and if so you will travel with more ease to yourself than with wheels. I cannot tell you any news not having seen to my great mortification any  since you went away. Nor have I been out of the House Since I returnd after leaving you. I did not think I should have felt so lonely. It seems so still all day long, as if half the Family were gone. Let me hear from you as soon as you get to  Philadelphia, and sooner if this Should reach you at  New York as I design it shall. I hope poor Cheeseman is not cast away with your Trunk of , but if he was within reach of the Storm I know not how he could stand it. I presume we shall hear many a Melancholy Ship wreck.   "

I shall with impatience wait to hear of your arrival there. The Snow remaind with us but one week Since which we have had pleasent weather.

I See by yesterdays paper that our Son is one of a committe to present an address to the Governour for to request his aid in procuring a repeal of the Anti Theatrical Law which a large Majority of the inhabitants have voted at their late meeting to Petition the Legislature to repeal, and to co operate with the Representatives in Such measures as may be judged expedient to give effect to the Petition, a writer in the Centinal  [handles] his Excellency without fear. He tells him in plain words that it was both unnecessary and irregular in the chief Magistrate to compl complain to the Legislature that the Law was violated, they had nothing to do with it, their functions consisting in enacting not in executing Laws. Charge him with acting from passion and encourageing a Mob to commit outrages. The poor Man has certainly burnt his fingers, and will have the Gout most bitterly as soon as the General Court convene, he has other SubJects of mortification at this time I trust. I Should be glad to hear from you once a week at least. Do you sleep warm? Thomas does not write to me. He contents himself with hearing from me by you. You will let Brisler know his Family are well. Faxon wants Money to Buy Stock, he wants three Cows and 4 young cattle he Says. He and the two Nightingales have valued Savils, at 12 pounds  Acre. I askd Faxon what rule he went by. Mentiond this Meddow of Bass's that you gave Seven pounds for, but he is wild; that would fetch 20 he Says, and this of Savils, is as well worth 12 as Frenchss was Six. I have ask'd your Brother. He thinks it too high, but I suppose your Son will write you about it. I have advised him to allow 9 pounds ten Shillings as you Love Land better than Money, or to take the Meddow for the debt. Grain rises daily so does every article of produce Mutton excepted. Are things as much higher at  Philadelphia as they are here? I mean have they risen in the Same proportion? I hope they will Stop or the Banks fail. One thing I am pretty certain of, that Farmers should have produce to sell instead of  every article. Regards to all inquiring Friends from your ever affectionate   "

","My Dearest Friend I received your two kind   of 7th  and 12 of this Month. I have written to you regularly every week Since you left me. We have not had any deep Snow since the first in which you was caught upon the road, the greater part of that soon left us, and has been Succeeded by two Slight Snows of a few inches depth, the weather has however been Steadily cold and generally with a clear Sun Shine. I find the cold irritation creates as great an irritation upon my Nerves producing a Tremor, as the heat does by relaxation. I Suffer more on that account than any other. I think I have not past a whole winter here for Nine years before. I think I mentiond to you that I had Setled with Shaw for the 5 Months he had lived with us, and agreed with him at the price we talkd of, for four Months more. He is very Steady, carefull and constant to buisness, tho not so Strong and active as Some others. I have not yet any prospect of getting Such an additional Hand as you want. I have desired Mr. Cary to inquire for me but they do not incline to let themselves till Spring. They do not know what price to ask. These pernicious Banks will undoe us. Yesterday Mr. Cranch gave a dollor pr Bushel for Rye. Bills which you know were three and four pr cent above par when you went away are now much below par. Large Quantities have been Sent here from the southard to be sold, tis said here that the demand for grain  abroad, is the occasion of it, but I suspect Something political manuver manoeuvre tho I know not what, and upon this Occasion I am like Some other persons perhaps jealous without cause. I see the Banks multiplying in every State, and I consider them as so many Batteries raisd against the General Government. I think this one instance amongst many other in which the State Sovereigntys will prove pernicious. We daily feel the banefull effects of Such an overplus of paper. After What took place in  New York with respect to the Election of Mr. Jay. I had no expectation but that the Same party would oppose Your Election to the vice presidency. But I did not think that they would have led  Virgina by the Nose so . The vote of those two States have declared to the world the Hostile Sentiments they possess towards the Government, for at that, much more than at you personally, is it aimed, as to disliking your politicks, I do not believe that they know what your politicks are. I am sure they do not if they rely upon the Representiations which have been made to them by those whose Sole intention was to derive them. I own I cannot feel that cordiality towards those States which I do for those who have been unanimous towards you. I respect individuals of each, and I pitty those who are blinded by party, if I know myself I do not think it is because I have Such a fondness for the Station, but because I think much of the tranquility and happiness of the Government depends upon having in that Station, an establishd Character for firmness and integrity and independence, and Such  must be the Character who can divest himself of all personal feelings, and do equal justice to those who are declareedly in opposition to his principals, as to those who unite in Sentiment with him, thus much for politicks. The best written peice I have read, and one which Shews the Author to have had an acquaintance with all the transactions which have taken place for a number of years past, was that which was addrest to the Free and independent Electors of president and vice president in Fennos paper of the 1 of Decbr. I have a curiosity to know the writer. Tomorrow I have a Number of hands going to cut the Timber for the Corn House that it may be ready for the first Snow.  and Friends are all well. I received a Letter from Thomas. Shall write to him soon. Affectionate Regards to Mr. and Mrs. Otis and to all other Friends. I have the advantage of you. I have Louissa for a bed fellow but She is a cold comfort for the one I have lost. Pray continue to write weekly to your ever affectionate   "

","My dearest Friend Our Son brought me  your  of the 19 december  on Sunday last, by which I find that the same Ideas have past through both our minds on a late Election. Amidst all that has been written upon the occasion, no one has ventured to State the comparative merits, and Services of the Candidates, but have contented themselves with saying that they would not bear a comparison that Clintons were lighter than a feather when weighd against Yours. The peice I mentiond to you in my last letter did you more justice than any which I have before read. The Characters who have been most active against you, are many of them such as a Man would rather chuse to be in opposition to than upon terms of civility with. The misfortune is that they have their weight and influence in Society, Possessing some talants and no principals they are fit agents for Mischiefs of the blackest kind. By the Candidate they have opposed to you, they have come forward and openly declared themselves opposed to the Government. Mark their measures, watch their movements and we shall see them struggling whenever they dare shew themselves, for the assendency. The late Success of the Arms of  France against their Enemies, seems to give much satisfaction to the half thinking politicians, as tho the  Retreat of the King of Prussia Was to give Peace to  France and heal all her internal wounds, establish a quiet Government and build up a Republick in a Nation shaken to its center, and went to peices by Faction. When I read Citizen President, and Citizens Equality, I cannot help feeling a mixture of  and contempt for the Hyprocrisy I know they are practising and for the Tyranny they are Executing. I was visiting at Mr. Apthorp the other day. He mentioned to me the Surprize he was in when he read Pains Letter and the account he gave of the treatment he received from the Custom house officers who searchd his papers, to find that the P-t had any correspondence with a man whom he considers as an incenderary and a Character unfit for to be trusted. He could not but consider it as degrading his Character and doubted the Authenticity of the Letter, Tho it struck me in the same manner when I read the account. I was determind not to say so to him. I only observd to him that the passage publishd could not do any injury to any Character, tho no doubt Mr. Pain took pains to have it known publickly that he had the honour of a Letter from the President in order to give himself weight and importance.  are a few lines which pleasd me from a Symplicity of Stile as well as for the truth they contain. The Auther I know not, They are taken from  the Centinal. You inquired of me in a late Letter whether I had any prospect of  a Man by the Year. A Young Man of a good Countanance has offerd himself this week. He lived the last Year with a Mr. Williams at  Roxbury. He is from the State of  N. Hampshire and has lived four years at  Roxbury in different places a Year at a time. He talkd of 30 pounds by the Year. I told him that would not do. I did not hear that more than 24 was given by any body the last year, and that it must be a very extraordinary hand to earn such wages. I told him we did not want a hand till the first of March. He said he wishd to let himself immediatly, but we  [finally] came to these terms. If upon inquiry his character would answer and you approved I would hire him from the 1 of Feb'ry and he came down to 26 pounds, which You will think too high perhaps, but I am not bound to take him if you do not chuse. I mentiond the first of Feb'ry that I might have time to write to you, and in the mean time I shall inquire his Character. Present My Love to Mrs. Otis, and Regards to all inquiring friends from your ever PS Timbers for the Corn House is all cut and drawn  in the woods waiting for Snow to get it home. We have very cold weather but little Snow about 2 inches depth.   "
Quincy  Janry. 7th. 1793 ,"My Dearest Friend I received your Letter by Mr. Roberdeau who with our Son and Young Mr. Quincy came out and  with me to day. I was pleased to see a Son of your old Friend and acquaintance for whom you have so often expresd a Regard; as well as the agreeable Husband of Miss Blair that was; we had much conversation about my acquaintances in  Philadelphia, many of whom he could give me a particular account of. We past a very pleasent day. I once or twice last summer exprest an anxiety at not hearing from Thomas so often as I wishd: I recollect you askd me, if I was equally anxious about you when absent. My days of anxiety have indeed been many and painfull in years past, when I had many terrors that encompassed me around. I have happily Surmounted them, but I do not find that I am less Solicitious to hear constantly from you than in times of more danger, and I look for every Saturday as a day on which I am to receive a Boon. I have received a Letter every week since you left me, and by this Days post two,  one of the 28  and  one of the 29th Decbr.  for which receive my thanks particularly that part in which you say you are not less anxious to see me than when Seperated 20 years ago. Years Subdue the ardour of passion but in lieu thereof a Friendship and affection Deep Rooted Subsists which defies the Ravages of Time, and  [illegible]   will Survive whilst the vital Flame exists. Our attachment to Character Reputation and Fame increase I believe with  our Years. I received the papers National Gazzet and all I See the dissapointed Electors  [illegible]   wish to excuse their vote by Representations respecting you, that prove them to have been duped and deceived, while the Antis fly of assureing the publick that the Monarchy Men, and the Aristocracy have become quite harmless. If so it is to be hoped that their hue and cry will subside. Present me kindly to all the good Ladies who favour me by their inquiries after my Health. It is better than the last winter tho very few days pass in which I can say that I feel really well. I have not heard  of the Chaise since you wrote me that it was left at  Hartford. I believe it will not reach Home till Spring. The Narrow  [ . . . ]  to the water have been so blocked up with Snow that Shaw has not been able to get up any Sea weed lately: he attempted it but could not Succeed, and the ground has been bare in the Road, The Timber for the corn House is all cut and part of it got home, one day more will  [illegible]  compleat it. Faxon was going this last week to the Ceadar Swamp it being now a fine time but very unfortunately a Man on the Road near it, broke out with the Small pox and refused to be moved so that he cannot go. We have not had any Sleding in the Road this Winter yet the Ground has been pretty much coverd with a thin Snow and Ice, the weather in General very cold. Hay is  fallen I am told to 4 and 6 pence pr hundred. Grain still holds its price, superfine flower 7 dollors pr Barrel oats 3 Shillings pr Bushel. I have not had occasion yet to purchase. My Horses are So little used that they are high Spirited enough with 3 quarts a day. James takes very good care of them. I do not regreet Your parting with the others. One pr are Sufficient here, and a good able Farm Horse will do us more Service and be much more  [illegible]   prudent for us. I hope you live prudent enough now for the most Republican Spirit of them all, from the Debates there appears a Jealous carping ill naturd Spirit Subsisting and a great desire to crush the Secretary of the Treasury and the Minister of War. You was right. The chief  denies his having given permission to the Mobility to pull down the Theatre. His prime Minister under the Signature of a Friend to Peace, has undertaken to defend his whole conduct, whilst a writer under the Signature of Menander defends his fellow citizens, to Say no more like an able counsel. These peices you will find in the Centinal of December 19 and 22 and 26th. That Those of the 19 and 22th are written in a Masterly Stile. Your Friends here are all well excepting Brother Cranch who has had a very ill Turn. I fear he will not tarry long with us.   "

Quincy  Boston  Janry. 22 1792  [i.e. 1793]
","My Dearest Friend I received  your kind  of Janry. 8   and 9th  and on Saturday a Letter from our Daughter I have been in Town for a few Days, for the first time. I chose not to come till all the Bustle of Election was past. Election for a Representative has taken place since I came here. Honestus's Friends and emisaries have been indefatigable in procuring votes for him, and their Success has been Such that he Stands highest upon the list, and tho it is presumed that their will not be a Choice, he and Dr. Holten will be the Candidates. Dr. Jarvis is Sitting up for Federal Senator in the Room of Mr. Strong. Speculation is the popular Topick when a Man is to be crushd, and that is the crime of which Mr. Strong is Said to be guilty, and tho I presume it is quite groundless, yet it will answer a party purpose. An other Idle Story is that Mr. Pitt has resignd and that the President of the U.S. is going to resign in March. As tho there could be any connextion between the resignation of the first Minister of State in  England and the chief Majistrate here. Nor can I devine the policy of the Report unless it is meant for a Stock jobbing purpose. Yet there are persons   here Stupid enough to Swallow such reports. You will see by the papers the whole Town of B. laid under a tax of 3 Dollors pr head which they dare not refuse, even those who in their hearts dislike the Festival and will join in it no further than to pay the Money: the Civick Feast of the Cits, pushd down their Throats for fear of being Stiled Aristocrats. Such is the infectious Spirit of the Times. Mr. B.  is here . I Saw him at the assembly, where he was very Social. There were Some compliments paid to him, which tho in the Character of this Town, belongd not to a private citizen. Such as waiting the Dances for him for more than an hour and finally being obliged to begin without him, as he did not make his appearence till near nine o'clock dinning at five o'clock to conform to his hour, &c . One compliment however he has received not So much to his taste. A w for A rages of old Martinec affairs. Do you Suppose that Congress will meet after their dissolution on the 3d of March? I fear you will have as  a time Home as you had when you went. Love to Mrs. Otis. Her Friends  here are all well. My Health is better than it has been. I have not had any return of a Fever for two Months. I cannot Say as much for two years before. My Love to Thomas. I will write to him next week when I return to  Quincy.  "
"Quincy  Febry 1. 1793
","My dearest Friend Your last date, as yet received, was the  14 of  , I may have Letters in Town; but as the week has been Stormy I have not got them: I wrote you last from  Boston the day before the Civic Feast, as it was stiled. The day past in much better order than was apprehended: for to Men of reflection the Cry of Equality was not so pleasing, and to Men of Property very alarming. It was agreed amongst them to indulge a Spirit they could not suppress, and unite with the Mobility in their Feast, to keep a strickt watch and gaurd over them: and to appoint steady persons upon  [whom] they could depend to conduct the sacrifice, for such indeed was  [ . . . ]  ox. The whole was managed without any Riot except the distribution of the ox; a Table being placed at the upper End of State Street, the ox was paraded there, together with a load of Bread and 2 Barrels of Punch but no sooner was the ox cut in peices than they were seasd by some Sailors and Citizen Mobility, and thrown in every direction amongst the spectators, the Tables split to peices the plates &c made one Crash. The Punch and Bread were instantly driven of, the one to the Mall, where the Mobility followd and enjoyd it, the Bread to the Alms House; the day closed with much quietness and all was still by 12 o'clock at Night. You will have read the Toasts Which shew the Spirit that gave rise to the Feast, and the prodigious pains which they took to avoid drinking the Healths of any one but Washington whom they avoided stiling Citizen, Tis said Citizen Samuel  did not so well relish the Term, least the  [illegible]  Ears of his followers should be too much accustomed to it it,  [illegible]   and join with those who wish to have the Town incorporated. The two Candidates of Representives are no doubt Holten, and Austin, Mr. B.-n has descended to such Popular arts as have disgusted his Friends, it is said, but falshood is so current a coin on such occasions that I am slow of belief. I was very splendidly entertaind at his House whilst I was at  Boston; having heard some things, I was more attentive to what past. I found by his conversation that he was one of those, who thought that the President might unbend, and visit, and mix with Tom dick and Harry, He askd me if I had heard that; the Secretary of War was going to resign. I replied that I had not. He said he had been informd so from a Gentleman, who heard it from Knox's Mouth  [ . . . ]  ght the President had been very unfortunate in that appointment. This brought to my mind Mr. Danes conjecture of the Author of the Strictures. I askd after Ward if any known cause existed for a personal animosity, but could not learn any thing further than their owning eastern Lands together perhaps some altercation might have arrisen. I was at the Assembly, and received many polite attentions. Mr. S--n and his Lady were civil beyond my conception. Such kind inquiries after the health of the V. P. and such solicitude to accommodate me. The high Sheriff too was vastly polite. Mrs. S--n  [Sullivan] and her daughter visited me a day or two after which was what I did not expect. I calld upon Mrs. 
Page 3
 Gill. She afterwards sent for me to take Tea with her, which I did, Mr. Gill was at  Prince Town. She proposed to me a Family Match which was to send my son JQA to  England for her Neice Miss Hollowell and to give her in Marriage to him. She wishes to have her Neice return to her, for Mrs. Adams says she, I am all alone in this Country. I have no connextion to call my own. Thus with an immence property She looks round her without a being for whom she feels any natural attachment to bestow it upon. There must be a something to Mar all our enjoyments in a state of Probation like this Life,  ""a Cruel Something unpossessd."" We have had a very open winter. The day before Yesterday we had a pretty fall of snow, which I hope will enable us to get Home the remaining Timber, and my Wood; Shaw laments that he has not a stronger Team. Faxon makes up two and is in constant employ for  or other. He has not however assisted me but one day which is in getting Timber. We have sent into the Ceader Swamp and got out some Rails. Faxon whose Eyes always see double, says, that 2000 may be cut upon one acre and a Quarter. I am glad however from Belchers and Shaws account to find that it is like to turn out well worth the money. I am anxious to get all the Buisness done which You left me in charge but the season has not been so favourable as we wisht. Our Friends are all well. Remember me kindly to Mrs. Otis. Her Sister is with me. She was so good as to spend a few days with me on my return from  Boston.   "

","My dearest Friend I received   together with the Newspapers. The Writings of the American Mirabeau, if he is an American and those under the Signature of Cincinnatus are insolent indeed, and are in Unison with a  [illegible]  Number of papers published in the  Boston Chronical calld the Crisis, supposed to be written in  Philadelphia and sent here for publication as I was told in  Boston that there was a Club, who were in constant correspondence with the S.- y of State. Those papers are leveld at the Government; and particularly against Hamilton, who will however I hope stand his ground. A very virulent peice has appeard in the same paper signd Stephen Colona Threatning the Government with the vengence of a hundred thousand Men if certain Characters formerly Stiled Antifeaderal were not more noticed and appointed to office. This writer says that the Constitution was addopted by Means of Artifice Cagoiling deception and he believes corruption. I read the peice at the time it was published, but had no Idea that the Author could be our former P.-h Friend. A very good answer followd it written; by Mr. Davis, signd Publius with a quotation, as the introduction from the Play called the Ladies of  Castille.  I received a Letter to day from our daughter dated Novbr. The Col. children &c were all well. She writes that our Minister complains loudly of expences that he had no Idea of them. Mrs. P. complains of the impudence of trades people in that Country. They must be strangly alterd, for I never saw more civility in any country. Nay I have often been surprized at their confidence in strangers. But perhaps these people have been accustomed to Slaves, and expect the same servility. Mr. M.  [Morris] renders himself very obnoxtious in  France by an active and officious Zeal in favour of the Aristocracy. He has lately been obliged to keep close, for the Jacobines declare that if he was not an American with a commission from Washington they would have had his Head upon Pike long ago. They are astonishd that such a character should he sent them. Short tis said is very voilent in  Holland. Humphries is really going to marry a Lady of Ample fortune. His Countrymen who have been in  Lisbon speak highly of his polite attention to them, but complain that they are not noticed by others. Mrs. Smith had visited Mrs. Beach who was well and vastly pleased with  England. If there is any vessel going from  Philadelphia pray write to Mrs. Smith for she complains very much that She does not hear from her Friends. Tis uncertain whether She returns in the Spring. I had a Letter  from Charles. He writes me that he had been sick with a fever which prevaild very much in  N. York, but was quite recoverd. We have had a fortnight of Sad Weather here one day very cold the next a warm rain and thaw. This has convinced me that I am still to suffer from my former complaint. I have been attacked with the old intermitting and am still struggling with it. We have  drawing home the remainder of the Timber: and Shaw has been employd with Faxon and two other hands whom I have hired in getting stuff from the Ceadar Swamp, in which they have found four or five pine Trees, old and fit for Boards. These I have had cut and drawn to the Saw Mill, We hope to get 2 thousand of Boards from them. We still have to cut and draw from the Woods Trees for Jistes, but our Snow comes and lies only a day or two, by which means we do not accomplish all we wish. My affectionate Regards to all inquiring Friends. Tell Benson I do not know what he means by abusing me so. I was always for Equality as  can Witness. Love to Thomas, from your affectionate   "

","My dearest Friend I received   and 30th. I well recollect receiving a Letter from Mr. Gerry soon after went first to  France informing me of Your being Elected a Member of the Phylisophic Society in  Philadelphia and when you received the volm in  England of their translations. I never could account for not finding your Name with the Members, The loss of the Records at that time accounts for it. You will hear before this reaches You of the Transactions in  England which I consider the begining  [of] Trouble. God only know where it will end, and whether we in this Country shall not be involved in the same Whirl-pool. Thus far I wrote and was prevented from proceeding last night. Our Son came up from Town with the  tyding of the arrival of the Col. Mrs. Smith and Family. I received a Letter from her at the same time dated  N. York. The Col. You will have seen before this reaches you, and from him you will learn more particulars Relative to the threadned overturn of  England, but I will say no more upon politicks at this Time, as I am not able to write much, and a few domestick concerns occur that I wish to mention. Dr. Tufts desires me  to mention to you Clover seed. He wishes Brisler to inquire the Price and if it can be purchased as low as 10 pence or a shilling pr pound. To procure a Barrel of it and ship it round tis 18 pence here and he says we shall want some and he will take the rest. Another article I would mention is some Porter and some Segars for your comfort and the last is whether it would not be adviseable to purchase a Strong Farm Horse in  Conneticut and let Brisler take home the Chaize. Our great oxen have performd pretty well while they could be used in the Cart, but in the snow without any leader before them they  [cured?] and Hawl, if the carters turn in such a manner that they cork themselves and have been useless unless when I could prevail with Faxon to let me have a Yoke from the Farm to go with them which he has done when we have sent to the Ceadar Swamp that broke his two teams which he keeps constantly employd. Shaw was much mortified and begd me to buy him a Yoke as he had Hay enough to keep them and could not possibly accomplish the Work unless I did. I sent him out to see several yoke, but they were too low in flesh and 55 dollars a pr. He solisited me to let him go to  Abington and try. I consented and he last night brought home a yoke comeing seven Years for which he gave 58 dollars. He says they are right Handsome cattle used to make stone Wall kind and smart in very good flesh &c. I hope what I have done will meet your approbation, which will always recompence me for 
Page 3
 whatever exertions I may make. I was taken sick on that day twelvemonth that I was the last year, I have been confined to my Chamber for a week, but have not the  complaints which I had last year. The fever rather tends to an intermitting. I have been Bled which has lessened the inflamitory Symptoms and I hope it will terminate without any long confinement. I have very good Nursing, and tho a deaf I believe a safe Physician. Mrs. Smith is  of comeing on to pass a Month with me before She goes to Housekeeping. Perhaps She may so contrive it as to come with you. You will see her soon and settle the accommodation. Mr. Cranch is well again as usual and sends his Love with many thanks for your kind expressions towards him. I caught the opportunity of writing whilst Sister was gone down to dinner but She Schools me for it. Love to . I hope he does not feel any Ague Complaints.   "

","My Dearest Friend My Last Letter was written to you in Bed. I write this from my chair, my fever is leaving me and I am mending So that I can set up the chief of the Day, the Dr. Says it was the unexpected News of Mrs. Smiths return that had as happy an effect upon me as to Break my fever, I am languid and weak but hope to be well by the Time you return; I Shall forward my next Letter to you, to be left at  New York as it might not reach you in  Philadelphia if you Set out as soon in March as you propose. I would mention to you Your Coupons for the Year least it Should Slip your mind. I believe I  in my last all that I could think of respecting domestick concerns, our Weather is so changeable that it retards the kind of Buisness which I Should be glad to have compleated, this Week we have had floods of rain, which has carried of the chief of the heavy Snow which fell the week before. O I forgot to mention to Mr. Brisler to cut me Some of the weeping willows, and put on Board any of the vessels comeing this way. Some of Mr. Morriss peach tree Grafts, we have Some young plumb trees which will answer for Stocks. Your Brother told me on Monday Evening that the Senate had made choice of Mr. Strong; I presume the House will concur.  Tis an ill wind which blows no good to any one. The late failures in  Boston have thrown Some buisness into the hands of our Son. He is well, and grows very fat. Present me  to all my Friends particularly to Mrs. Washington whom I both Love and respect. Remember me to Mrs. Otis and tell her that her Sister Betsy complains that She does not write to her. A Kiss to Miss Harriot. Tell her she must find out how I Sent it. Your Mother desires to be rememberd to you. One Day last week whilst I was the Most Sick, the Severest N East Snow Storm came that we have had through the winter, we could not pass with a carriage, and I desired my People not to let her know how ill I was as She could not get to See me, but no sooner was there a foot tract than She put on Stockings over her Shoes, and I was astonishd to hear her voice below Stairs. She has had better health than for some years past.   "

","My dearest Friend My early rising still continues, and I am writing by , It is a Week this day since You left me. I have rejoiced in the fine weather for your sake. It has sometimes been cold and Blustering, but the Air has been pure and bracing. On Saturday Night we had a plentifull Rain succeeded by a fine day. I presume You reachd  N. York yesterday. I hope You found all our Friends well tho I have not heard from Mrs. Smith for a long time. I could wish if You must go to  Philadelphia that You could have gone immediatly to your old Lodgings, Brisler could make Breakfast and coffe in the afternoon even if you was provided with dinner in some other place. All accounts however agree that the City is clear from infection. I sincerely hope it is, but I do not know what cause need be given to so many, as must suffer through anxiety and apprehension for their friends, when sitting a few weeks out of the city might remove it. Cousin Lucy Cranch came from Town last Evening and brought your Letter dated  Hartford, I also received one from  of the 17th, I suppose  You will find him in the City upon your arrival there, He writes that Dr. Rush assures him that he may come with safety. Our people here at home have been engaged some days in getting wood, one at the high Ways one in getting seaweed. By the Way Savil continues every day in bringing two and sometimes 3 Load. I do not know how much You agreed with him for, so I have not  him, as I knew you was desirious of getting a quantity. I expect he will cart till he has a pretty high Bill. Last Night accounts were received of a Bloody Battle between General Wayne and the Indians.  said Wayne kept the Feild tho with the loss of 500  [Men] and that the Indians left as many dead upon the  [Field]. Tis a great point gaind to keep the Feild against them. I hope they will now be convinced that we have Men enough to fight them.   Mrs. Brisler was well yesterday. She has been here two days, and went home last evening. Let me hear from you every week. It will be the only thing to keep me in spirits. I am glad the Virginians had some sense and some cunning as both united produced a proper measure. The Tone in  Boston is much  of Mr. Consul. He begins to make his Toasts and to  coax and whine like a Hyena, as if having made use of big threatning language he had terrified the puny Americans and now was willing to kiss and make Friends. Present me to all those Friends Who have survived the general Calimity, and as ever I am    "

","My dearest Friend Mrs. Otis has courage to   join You. If my duty calld me, I presume I should not be wanting, and feel less anxiety for myself perhaps than I do now, for those of my Friends who have become inhabitants of a city so recently relieved from pestilence. I was  in Mrs. Otis's not passing a Week with me before She set out, but I received a letter from her this Evening informing me that She sits of on Monday morning, I have received only one Letter from you as yet. We have had a  [severe] snow storm this week which blockd up some of our narrow  [lanes]. The ground has been so frozen since you left me that tho our people have removed the Stones; Faxon has not been able to plough. I have seen Porter: but he quiddles so, and his wife sees so many Lions in the way that I doubt whether we shall ever come to an agreement. The sum I offerd it seems does not content her, and is not so good she says, as what Mr. Black gives. At last I told Porter that if there must be so much difficulty, I would persuaid you to stock that place with Young cattle and keep the dairy alltogether at the other place, and there the matter rests. If Humphries does not incline to go on, I will send for Shaw and make terms with him if I can. Dr. Tufts proposes as soon as the first Month expires to take up the Note and pay a Quarter part of the principal, and upon the second Month to apply the interest  of the Notes in his hands together with some which he has of his own and pay of an other quarter. I mention this to you that you may know early his intention. I have paid some Bills and make a purchase of one Hog, Wt. 4 score and half and am in treaty for a Cow, Beals did not bring down any Stock, Captain Beals has advertizd all his for sale at Squantum together with his Hay, I will forward you my mem. of expenditures Monthly, I have not Yet got Pratts account. When the Season will permit shall go on to execute Your direction with as much accuracy as possible.   "

","My dearest Friend I hope this days post will bring me a Letter from You at  Philadelphia and that I shall hear you are well and at Mr. Otis's the obliged as they say to keep Batchelors Hall for a short period. Mrs. Otis I trust will be with you before this Letter I wrote by her  I had little to inform You of. Your Farm will occupy Your mind I know sometimes and you will wish to know if the Ground is broke up which You left unfinish'd the stones have been removed and one days Work after a Rain has been performd. The people are anxious to compleat it the next day tho the ground was stiff, but  [in] the attempt they Broke the beam beam of the plough and were obliged to quit. We have sent it to be repaird and the first opportunity it will be completed The Weather has been pleasent and the Seaweed is attended to every day when wood is not Arnold is very anxious to tarry with me and has offerd to stay at Six dollars the winter months. At present I thought I could do without him but gave him encouragement that I would hire him if Snow came so as to get the stones across the pond. What can be done with the set of wretches who have begun their Winter depredations upon the cedar pasture, Cut down trees lately as Arnold informs me. Some of those which the fire past over   have been seen at the Wilson's door. Humphries informs Me that the lot call'd Ruggles s a burnd tree containing 5 foot has been recently cut down and others near it and carried of by nobody knows whom. Boilstone Adams has had his Shop broke open this Week 2 sides of Soul Leather Boot legs and several calfs shins carried away. They broke the Glass and then unfastned the window. In short we seem to live amongst a people who have no sense of Right and wrong. Remember me kindly to all inquiring Friends. Read Columbus, and let me know the opinions of those who so. Mrs. Brisler and family are all well.   "
"Quincy  December 20th 1793
","My dearest Friend I have to acknowledge Your two kind Letters  one of the first  the other of the  5th of December  from  Philadelphia. My anxiety has in some measure abated since I found You went immediatly to your old Lodgings, as no person was sick in that house. If the air of it had been properly changed by opening and airing I should hope there might be no danger this winter. The Spring will be the most dangerous Season. I would fain hope that when  danger threatens, all personal views and interact will vanish or be swallowed up in the more liberal and enlarged Policy of Love of Country and of Mankind. The Speach of the President is that of the wise Man who foreseeth the danger and gaurdeth against it. I never liked the translation, hideth himself. That looks too cowardly for a wise and brave Man I would hope that Congress may be so united in their measures as to dispatch important matters in a short period. The message relative to foreign affairs was more free and decisive than I expected. Every one may see that the president is much in earnest and that tho cool he has felt properly warm'd. Genet has renderd him self contemptable indeed. Columbus has not done with him. By what I can learn he has carried conviction to those who before doubted for want of proper information. I have not seen any attempt to answer him. I should like to know what the  Opinion of themthe peices is with Your members. Some persons have said they were written by Ames. Others ascribe them to Mr. Gore to Mr. Otis and some to another hand. Russel has been Questiond. He say they are not in his hand writing,  ""but Sir I know the writer. There is but one Man capable of Writing them!"" I rejoice that  has got through his Studies and examination I hope he will get into business. I know he will be attentive industrious and obligng I sincerely pray that he may be prosperous. The Season is fine with us. I have written to you every week Since Your absence and was surprizd to find by your Letter of the 9th to our Son that you had not heard from me. Mrs. Otis is with you before this time, and will add to the comfort and happiness of the Family. When I found that no danger was apprehended I wrote to urge her to go on. I hope your Health is better for Your Journey. I have not been sick, but have a Remembrancer of my old Ague tho I have not been in  Boston. Louissa at the same time and a much severer attack so as to shake an hour I hope we have queld it for the present. Our Friends are all well I propose visiting a new Nephew to day Mrs. Norten has an other Son Girls seem to be denied our Families. I hope we shall not have occasion for so many soldiers. Remember me to all my old acqcaintance whether in or out of Congress. Is Mrs. Washington with the President. My particular regards attend her from Your I have seen the Dr. . He tells me that he took up the Note and payd three hundred pounds, gave his own for the other three hundred which he proposes to pay of the next month, as he does not like the trouble of a monthly renewal. Besides that it amounts to seven pr ct as the interest must be pay'd monthly I believe I mentiond to you before that he designd the interest due in Janry as part of the sum. If You can other ways provide for me I would not break in upon his plan. I have purchased 30 Bushels of Oats the price 2.10 pence pr Bushel. I must soon procure an other load of hay. Savil has carted 30 load of seaweed. He has not yet call'd for his pay. Our people have carted 13 load and very different ones from Savils. His object was to get up three loads pr day, and load all himself. It could not be large. I have as you directed, askd Mr. Pratt for his Account. He will bring it in a few days. I have payd Arnold and he is gone for the present. Thus much for Business. I received  Letter of december 9th and will write him soon. It already seems a long time since You left me. I fear I shall not be able to look forward to your return at so early a period as the last year.   "
"Quincy  Decbr. 28 1793
","My dearest Friend The Weather is so  cold that my ink almost freezes whilst I write, yet I could not let a week Pass without writing to you, tho I have few occurrences to entertain You with I received last Saturday your two Letters  one of the 12  and  one of the 13th , December I have not yet had a  Philadelphia paper. When the pamphlets are out containing the correspondence between the Ministers I hope you will send me one. In Edds paper of the last week appeard a low abusive peice against the British minister for the conduct of his court towards  America but it is really too low for notice. The Chronicle exults, without Reason however at Dallas'es Reportt. It has become as much of a party paper as Freaneus. There is a great and general Allarm arising from the depredations which it is reported and feard the Algerians have made upon American vessels. All imported articles particuliarly  West India produce has risen in conseqence of it; Congress will indeed have their hands free of Business, and will have no time I hope, and very little disposition to quarrel I am solisitious to know what Genets conduct will be at  Philadelphia. I presume he does not show his Head at the Level, nor will he venture a visit to you in his publick Character; I think he is much like Cain after he had murderd Abel. Columbus closed last Saturday. I hope you have seen all the Numbers.  We have had in the course of the last week a very sudden Death Dr. Rhoads was taken sick with a nervious fever and dyed the 3 day leaving a most distrest family 5 children 2 of them quite Babies, and Mrs. Rhoads hourly expecting to get to Bed, and in want of every necessary of Life. I never was witness to a more distresst Scene I attended the funeral, and found her in fits, the children and People in the Room all terifye'd not knowing what to do with, or for her Dr. Phips had run home for some Medicine; and every person seem'd to be thrown into the utmost distress. The Dr. was a kind Husband and an inoffensive man, dejected and disspirited tis said by his prospect, Her Situation is pityable indeed. She has since got to bed and happily I may say lost her Baby which no doubt sufferd from her distress of Body and Mind. Our Friends here are all well. I do not learn that any persons have been  by going into the city of  Philadelphia so that my fears and apprehensions are much quieted. This very cold weather if it reaches You will tend to preserve the health of the inhabitants, but I fear it will pinch you severely. It gives me the Rhumatism.   "
"Quincy  Decbr. 31 1793
","My dearest Friend Your two kind Letters  reachd me on the 28th. They are my Saturday evenings repast. You know my mind is much occupied with the affairs of our Country. If as a Female I may be calld an Idle, I never can be an uninterested Spectator of what is transacting upon the great Theater, when the welfare and happiness of my Children and the rising generation is involved in the present counsels and conduct of the principle Actors who are now exhibiting upon the Stage. That the Halcion days of  America are past I fully believe, but I cannot agree with you in sentiment respecting the office you hold altho it is so limited as to prevent your being so actively usefull as you have been accustomed to, Yet those former exertions and services give a Weight of Character which like the heavenly Orbs silently diffuse a benign influence. Suppose for Instance as things are often exemplified by their contraries, a Man, in that office, of unbridled Ambition, subtle intriguing, warpd and biasd by interested views, Joining at this Critical Crisis, his Secret influence against the Measures of the President, how very soon would this Country be involved in all the Horrours of a civil War. I am happy to learn that the only fault in Your political Character, and one which has always given me uneasiness, is wearing away. I mean a certain irritability which has some time thrown You of Your Guard and shown as in the ported of Louis l4'th that a Man is not always a Hero. Partizans are so high, respecting English and French politicks, and argue so falsly and Reason so stupidly that One would suppose they could do no injury, but There are so many who read and hear without reflecting and Judging for themselves that and there is such a propensity in   humane Nature to believe the worst, especially when their interest is like to be affected, that if we are preserved from the Calamities of War it will be more oweing to the superintending Providence of God than the virtue and wisdom of Man. How we are to avoid it with  France supposing Genet should not be recall'd I know not. Must we submit to such insults? Judging from the manner in which  France has carried on the present War, I should not wonder if they feard Partition of their Kingdom. A Frenchman reminding an Englishman of the Time when in the Reign of Henry the Sixth, the English were almost absolute Masters of  France said sneerlingly to him  ""When do you think you will again become Lords of our kingdom?"" to which the Englishman replied,  When your iniquities shall be greater than ours,"" How can any Nation expect to prosper who War against Heaven? By this time you will have seen all the Numbers of Columbus. I should like to know the Presidents opinion of them as well as some other Gentlemen who are Judges. They assuredly are ably written and do  both to the head and Heart of the writer who deserves well of his fellow Gentlemen for the information he has thrown upon a subject of so much importence at so critical a period. But their is a  ""barberous Noise of Asses Apes and dogs"" raisd by it in the Chronical. Nevertheless sound reason and cool Argument will prevail in the end. Having spun a thread out with respect to  I Will think a little of our own private affairs. Dr. Tufts has paid two hundred pounds and become responsible himself for the remainder. I wrote to you his further intention. The 17 of Jany he proposes to discharge two   hundred pounds more. I have closed my account this day. I have kept an exact acount of my expenditures and payments since you left me which I inclose to you. Mr. Cary offerd to bring me an other load of Hay at the same price. What he brought is agreed to be of the first quality, and it was all weighd, but I did not feel myself in a capacity to engage it absolutely. We have hitherto had so little Snow that Buisness is dull. Mr. Belcher has cleard of all the Sea weed untill some high Tide brings more. He is now getting home the pine wood. Our Friends desire to be remembered to you. Mrs. Brisler and family are well. You will present me  to Mrs. Washington who I respect and Love. My Love to  I hear he is for fighting the Algerines, but I am not sure that would be the best oconomy, tho it might give us a good pretence for Building a Navy that we need not be twichd by the Nose by every sausy Jack a Nips. He had better find Law for his countrymen and prevail upon them to take it.   "
"Quincy  Janry. 5th 1794
","My dearest Friend I did not receive  your Letter of decbr. 15  till I had closed mine of the 30th. Two of later date came first to Hand. The reason is I suppose that Bringhurst did not send in his account before I left  Philadelphia, was that he never used to make out his account but once a year. I had  him up to Jan'ry 12; Robert by his drunken frolicks exposed us to double a necessary expence and the Chariot was wholy sacrificed to him, but I know not how Bringhurst does to make up such a Bill, unless he charges for the Stand for the Coach and the care of it. I had the same thought with You respecting the Carriage for the purpose it was designd for, as ever went out of a Workmans hands. The Chariot I believe would be considerd of very little value even as a Hack. More Carriages than are necessary, are quite a useless expence which I neither wish or desire. In my last Letter to you I inclosed my account, as luck would have it, and as I have often abserved upon like occasions, Savil brought me his Bill but as Sixteen dollars was really more than I could boast I told him he should be paid duringin the Month.  I have to pay one other account which feels to me a debt of honour and amounts to 9 pounds. I mean to Dr. Phips. I wrote You my reason for not calling upon Dr. Tufts as you told me I might do, before You knew what arrangements he had made. You will write me soon whether it is inconvenient to you to make me a remittance from  Philadelphia. I have had two applications from two different Men for the Farms, one by the Name of Hunt belonging to  Randolph a Young Man who has a wife and no children and whom your Brother speaks well of. The other is of one Richards who has a wife and a grown son and daughter. The Man has property of his own, and means to let a son lately married live upon it, if he can go upon an other. He has the Character of a sober honest Man. I do not think it amiss to hear those who apply and to inquire into their Characters, that we may not be at a loss when the Time comes for placing hands upon the Farm. I am told that Dr. Tufts knows this Richards, and of him I shall inquire. Thayer is not removed. We have not had any Snow to lye more than a day. It seems as difficult to snow as it did last summer to Rain.  
Page 3
 I am very apprehensive that Cheesman is lost. Such a report prevaild yesterday in Town. I did not pay any attention to the Trunk as I supposed the vessel was so nigh sailing when you went away that the Trunk was put on Board by Mr. Brisler. Upon inquiry I believe it was taken from Dr. Welchs by some of Cheesmans people and no receit given for it, or Bill of Lading. Yet as Cheesman was accustomed to carry things for us, and the Trunk was addrest if he arrived there will be no difficulty, but there is reason to fear for him as he has been out so long. Our Son came up last Evening and brought me  yours of the 22   and 23 of december . You are at the fountain and yet so far before us, that we do not keep pace with you. Only two Letters have yet been publishd of the important correspondence. One of Mr. Jeffersons to Mr. Morris and Genetts answer; a fine speciman of his Learning and of his English, of his civility and Breeding. A Number of Pieces have appeard in the Chronical order the Signature of Americanus, as false and Hollow as is the Heart of the writer, but he has an opponent to deal with who throws him upon his Back in every Passage, and when he knows not what to say, he whines and cants like the Hypocrite he is 
Page 4
 calls the performances of columbus purile and Literary Plagiarism from Juniors affected wit &c, and that even the high station of his Sire will not screen him from contempt. So true is the words of the Poet,  ""envy will Merrit as its shade persue."" Even those who know the value of the writings are ready to say,  ""Rather than thus be overtopd Shall I not wish his Laurels cropt."" But the Time will come when this Young Man will be sought for as a Jewel of great price. I say this to you who divested of all connection would acknowledge the talents and abilities of Columbus,  perhaps neither You or I might feel so sensible a pleasure from the perusel as I am free to acknowledge is experienced by PS This is my Family pride to call this Son mine look in the Chronical forBarnevelt. "
"Quincy  Janry. 12th 1794
","My dearest Friend My Neighbor Captain Beals went to Town yesterday and was so good as to bring up, and send me my Letters last Evening, whilst I was sitting mourning that I had no hope of getting them, as the  was very bad and the day stormy. I find the Family an agreable acquisition. We live upon friendly and social terms. I agree with Mr. Izzard, that we are grown too old to live seperate, and I could literally construe that part of the Marriage Service, which says,  ""What God has put together, let No man put assunder,"" for in Youth most people are too young to be seperated, and he understood Humane Nature well; who pronounced that it was not good for Man to be alone."" Our present seperation is much mitigated by the frequent intercourse we are enabled to hold by Letter. Columbus finishd in his 5th Number, and I mean to hint to Barnevelt to close as soon as Possible. Americanus is by no means a match for him, but he is a false, fibbing contemptable antagonist, and will with a Brazen front; affirm that white is black, and black white, and tho the publick may be benifitted by shewing the Man in his true light and Character, there is no touching pitch without being defiled, and in order to confute him, he must be followd through his windings, and his inconsistences. These two writers may be compared to the Eagle and he the Snake.  ""The side way and oblique motion with which the snake goes on, points out the deceit he proceeds with. His Breast fix'd to the Earth, shews his adherence to self interest; the various inflexions and foldings of his Body are descriptive of his crooked Soul; and his conceald venom denotes the evil intention he hides."" The Generous Eagle aspires to Mount through the pure Air, by an honest flight, with his own Native strength, and the shafts which may be thrown at him, will recoil  and wound the Pursuers. If as you have heard Columbus is republishing both in  N. York and  Philadelphia, he will have opponents sufficient to keep down any vanity which might otherwise arise in his breast. He will find sufficient mortification in beholding so many of his fellow creatures disposed to ruin and overthrow a Government under which they might live quiet and peaceable Lives. He will see that he has a Herculean task to perform, and as many monsters to contend with. I would not however advice him to notice any of his opponents. The truth of his own arguements cannot fail to carry conviction to every candid inquirer, and like Gold will only shine the brighter the more they are Rub'd. The French Jacobins have united with our dissafected and unprincipald citizens, and will create much trouble I fear. An act of the State of  Georgia respecting suits in the Federal Court, breath a spirit of defience, and Virginia by some of her resolves plainly shews what manner of spirit She is of. The great Body of the people are however contented and happy. We know that they may be wrought up to a spirit of resistance and madness, but it will not be very easy to impose upon them. General Lincoln tells me that in his late Journeys he had much opportunity of conversing with them, and that he did so freely, but found them universally pleasd and happy. I find by the papers that Mr. Jefferson has resigned, and that the  Virginia Corps fill the vacant places. It is prudent perhaps that it should be so; I think I have heard You express a good opinion of the Talents of Mr. Taylor I should suppose that it ought to be a distinguishd, and solid Law, Character to fill that office with respectability. What ever may be Mr. Jeffersons motives for resigning, I presume he will not be neglected. Most men grow either Avaricious or ambitious as they advance in Life. It is storied of Pausanias that he inquired 
Page 3
 of Hermocrates how he might become eminent, and was answerd, by taking of the Head of the most eminent Man. Ambition has not yet reachd that Sumit in this Country, but overturn our Religion, and all the rest would soon follow. If these Jacobin Societyes are permitted and countananced in this Country, from the strides already made We have every thing to fear. In  France they have at length added the Murder of  unfortunate Queen to the measure of their Inequality, Whilst Humanity sickens at the recital of their crimes, her death is less horrible than the cruel imprisonment and indignities she has sustaind. I think we have great reason to fear that Cheesman is lost. You had the value of one hundred dollars on , one whole suit of black Broad cloth seven shirts which is a whole peice of Linnen one other coat and Waistcoat stockings and your Green damask Gown draws Waistcoats &c, and Thomas s Boots which I suppose he is in great want of. Poor Brisler too is a sufferer. Mr. Pratt brought me his account last week. I told him previously that I could not pay it till I had written to you. The foot of it is 34  10 S. 7 d. Humphries and Pater call'd upon me for their pay for cutting 22 cords of wood two pounds four shilling, which I dischargd. The payment of this Bill, and some small family demands have left me 0. Really in such situation as I never was before. The Dr. will discharge 200 this week and in order to do it he appropriates the whole interest due. I have given my word to Savil that he shall be payd this Month. I believe there will be no risk in sending. I am told by Your Brother who was in Town last week that great uneasiness prevails on account of this Jacobine club, and that they have for one object the overturning of the funding system, and an other is to rule the Comeing Election. The South end politicians have three candidates whom they mean to set up. The present Lt. Governour Judge Dana and Mr. Gerry. One Man, who I know not declares that You are the only Man he will vote for tho he should stand alone. My best Respects to Mrs. Washington with many thanks for the honor done me by her repeated kind inquiries. I  her for a prudence, which I know I do not possess. I could not keep silence as She does. To all my other Friends Male and Female present me kindly. I am often with them in imagination. Mrs. Brisler is well. Love to .  "
"Quincy  Janry. 18th 1794
","My dearest Friend I received two day ago  yours of  6th  with the Pamphlet, and last Evening our Son brought me  Yours of the 9th . When he comes, his first request is, to read all the Letters which I have received since his last visit, I usually grant him this indulgence. The compliment of  ""Learning force of Reasoning Style"" &c barely compensated for the censure which follow's. He felt it a little hard to have it upon both sides, for I had given him the week before, a similar hint respecting Barnevelt. I reminded him of Swift (I believe it was), who read all his peices to his Housekeeper, and if they passed with her, he ventured to offer them to the publick. In his last Number he corrected himself, butt as for Columbus, I own it was not two high seasond for me, considering the imtemperance, and contemptable Arrogance of the Man; whose conduct he Reprobated; in Rank of Life he was more than his equal; in Age no great difference, in Learning in Talants, in Wisdom, in Integrity: no Man of common Judgment would dispute the palm.  This post will bring you the speach of the Lieut. Governor.  ""They call it an old woman's speech"" but I would deny my sex, if any old woman in the country would have made a speach so little to the purpose. Not one word Relating to the buisness of the Common Wealth or the affairs of the State but a long Farago, to prove what every Child knows, that all Men have equal Natural Rights. His Head seems to be turnd with some vague Ideas about Liberty and equality, whether he had an Idea that his want of Property might be an objection in the minds of some against voting him into the Chair, and this was addrest to his fellow citizens to remove that obstical. I am perfextly at a loss to fathom his views. Then he must lug in  France to shew his attachment to that part of the Nation who have so wisely leveld all distinction. The Speach has tincture of the Jacobine Spirit, and is a  a convinceing proof that he is wholy Unfit for the Chair. The Attorney General has withdrawn his Name from the Jacobine Society, having met once with them; and dissaproveing; as he says their views, he desires that all his Friends would publickly anounce this. Our General Court it is said, dissaprove this new Erected tribunal. Mr. S.-- might think his popularity endangerd. Such is the Hypocricy of the Man, that I could believe him influenced by any Motive, rather than a disgust from proper principals. Americanus and Barnevelt met the other Evening at a wedding visit, to a Brother Lawyer. The Company was numerous. A. entered and in the most cordial manner caught B--'s hand. How do you Brother, said he shaking it. B.-- Bowd and replied very well. Well Brother, When do you open the Theater? To which B. answerd by saying what do you propose to do with the Law Mr. Attorney General? Why I mean to go when it opens and take with me the L. Governor Deacon Newal Parson Cackly and some other good folks; and as you are State Attorney You must take care of that to which B. in good humour replied that he hoped the Attorney General would not oblige the State Attorney to prosecute him. One of the Company, whisperingly say'd is not this curious to see Americanus and Barnevelt so perfectly good humourd? It seems that Mr. Attorney General excused himself from Attending the Court of Sessions and requested the Court to appoint some person in his Room, and they appointed their former one. Mr. Jeffersons  resignation tho long talkd of was not fully credited untill it took place. The reason given for it by the French Partizans is that the Nature of his office obliged him to lend his Name to Measures which Militated against his well known principals; and give a sanction to sentiments which his heart disapproved. If this is true he did wisely to withdraw. They say that he will now appear as the Supporter of Genet and they consider him all their own. But I have always reluctantly believed ill of him and do not credit these reports. Yet I know Mr. Jefferson to be deficient in the only sure and certain security, which binds Man to Man and renders him responsible to his Maker. As I am not in the Secrets of the Cabinet, I can only judge from what comes to light, and there is sufficient visible to make me very anxious for my Country. It was certainly the intention of the National Convention to  us with all their Enemies, and they chose a fit instrument for the purpose. I think from Genets instruction that they were quite ignorant of our Government and Constitution. The President has a most difficult and Ardous Task. May he have that Wisdom which is from above, which is profitable both for to direct and Counsel.  I pray in return for the many kind inquiries Mrs. Washington is  to honour me with, that You would present her my affectionate Regard and best wishes for her Health and happiness. Miss Louissa present her Respectfull duty to Mrs. Washington and her Love to Miss Custos. Remember me to Mrs. Otis and Miss Harriet. Tell Mrs. Otis She must write to me and tell me all she knows about our old Friends and acquaintance. I hope You have calld to see Mrs. Powel in her affliction. To Mrs. Dalton and Family remember me affectionatly. Tell Miss Polly I saw Mr. Cranch from  Haverhill a few days since, that Mr. White was well, and I sent him word that I approved his taste, and thought him quite right not to permit  Philadelphia to  [illegible]  Rob us of  so amiable a young Lady. My Love to Son Thomas. We are in our Family well tho a slow Nervious fever prevails in some instances here and in Several other places. The Weather changes so suddenly from one extreem to an other that it will generate sickness. It is a very poor winter for Buisness. We have not had snow enough to use a Sled at all and the Ground frequently so Rough as to render Wheals impractacable. I presume You must have received the acknowledgment You mention before this time. Let Brisler know that his wife was well Yesterday.  "
"Quincy  Janry 24 1794
","My dearest Friend We have had four days and Nights of Rain an old fashioned rain. If there had been upon the Ground a Body of snow, the flood of Rain, would have carried away all our Mills and Bridge: It has laid our fences in the  below the House flat the water is a foot above the bridge at Mr. Blacks, and over the Top of his wall which he built last summer. Till this Rain we have not had Water to Grind with in Town and the Wells were very low. I expect a Feb'ry winter. The news of last evening is that the duke of Yorks Army with himself are captured and  Toulon retaken with every ship. This in a hand Bill from Genet, who seems out of Breath for Joy, as he represents the whole City of  Philadelphia. He says the News arrived by a vessel from  France which was sent there by the President,  ""and that Congress could not stay in their Sitting."" If I thought such an event would   accelerate an Honorable Peace in  Europe and enable  France to Govern themselves, I could most sincerely unite in acclamations and congratulations but such is the state of wild Frenzy which possesses that devoted Nation that they will instantly invade  England if in their power, possess themselves of  Spain, and overturn every Throne, which they have ability to assault. Brissot and 14 others have followed the Queen in quick succession. Honchard we are told is also Goullitened If it is not treating a subject so melancholy with too much levity; one might advise any future general, whom the Convention may be disposed to invest  with the Chief Command to Send them such an answer, as it is said Harry the 8th of  England received from a Foreign Lady to whom in the latter part of his Reign, he signified that it was his pleasure to Marry her. To which she replied I am highly sensible of the honour your Majesty intends me, and if I had more Heads than one should be proud of the alliance but as I have not, I must beg leave to decline the connexion."" I hope tomorrows post will bring Us more particulars, than Genets hasty hand Bill. I am  almost tempted to wish that I was as ignorant of the affairs of my country, as those who are busied in a Round of dissipation I should at least be free from the constant anxiety and solititude which at present occupies all my thoughts. If by it I could render any service to my Country, I should receive some compensation I want to hear every day from you. I want to sit down and converse with you, every evening I sit here alone and Brood over probabilities and conjectures. The democratick Societys might more properly be termd Genetian. The resolves publishd in yesterdays paper of that Society in  Philadelphia are rather more assuming than their  Boston Brethren. They are not yet sufficiently powerfull to carry their meaures into effect. Swift says that man is so much of the Nature of a Sheep, that whoever is bold enough to give the first great Leap over the Heads of those about him, tho he be the worst of the flock, will be quickly followd by the rest, Besides when Parties are once formd, the Stragglers look so ridiculous and become so insignificant, that they have no other way but to run into the herd, which at least will hide   and protect them, and where to be much considerd requires only to be very voilent."" From these causes I dare say do the Numers in these Societyes increase, for the people are happy are contented satisfyed with the Government and those who administer it. All those who wish to disturb it, will be found like Jarvis Austin Morten when weighd in the balance, wanting -- wanting office wanting property or wanting Morals. Thus do I run on, merely for the sake of saying something to you, which may perhaps be as much to the purpose, as somethings which you hear in the Assembly over which You preside, and if it should not, why then I can relinquish my right to a terms go long  that I am almost tempted never to claim it again, except it is to assure  Mrs. Brisler was well this evening. Love to Son .   "
Quincy  24 5 [25 ]Jan'ry  [1794 ]Saturday Evening,"My dearest Friend The Weather from an unhealthy Warmth has changed to an insufferable Cold. I had little expectation of getting my Letters , but a Market Man whom I requested to call upon our Son, was faithfull to his promise, and brought me  Yours of the 12   and 14th . I also received a letter from an other hand so late as the 17th but not a Word of the important foreign intelligence, which so greatly agitated Congress, and created such a paroxysm of joy throughout all  Philadelphia, put Genet out of breath, and sent his Hand Bill Gasping to  Boston. I have not this days paper, neither, so that I am not able to learn what confirmation it contains of the News, and I do not very readily give credit to such big stories. I thank you for Your Pamphlets, just received. I have not been able to look into them, as I took my pen to write to you this evening that I might be early enough for the Mondays past. Barnevelt close after defending Columbus and detecting Americanus in many gross , who appeard quite beat of his ground. I never discoverd any improper vanity or exultation in Barnevelt. He felt himself upon strong ground as he had some of the most Approved and Ancient writers for his Authoritys and he did not chuse to be Ridiculed whedeld or falsified out of them. He maintaind and supported them I think with dignity, discovering however a little too much contempt for his opponent, a little Family Pride, on the Fathers side I mean. If I may be allowd to say so I thought if Americanus was the person supposed, his Age intitled  him to a respecctfull language, especially as he appeard to be Humbled and feel his inferiority in the Strength of Arguments of his Opponent, and it was upon this head that I wrote my mind to Barnevelt, who instantly stood corrected,  ""Envy will merrit as its Shade persue"" I remarked to our Son when he mentiond to me the circumstances you allude to, that you had all your days experiencd a similar Treatment, and that he must prepare his mind to bear it fortifying it with justice with candour, with integrity and with independence, for the only safe and durable policy in that which in founded in justice and Truth. I received the Bills and shall use them with as much  as possible. I have been to day to visit our parent who is unwell, more so that I have known her since my return here. She took a great cold and is distrest with a cough. I do not consider her as dangerous at present, but her advanced Age leads one to be allarmd at any attack. There will be no attention in my power to render her that both from a principal of duty and affection I shall be wanting in solicitious to render her every possible service and attention. Pope says the Ruling passion in strong is death. Hers, has been an anxious solicitude for the Welfare of her Family, and in the midst of a coughing fit, to day, She stopt, to inquire if you had heard of your Trunk.  Your Mother is not worse , tho I cannot say She is better. I would not have renderd you uneasy by mentioning to you her illness but at her age the candle is soon extinguishd burnt down time.  The Dr says She has not much fever and approves of all I had done for her I could not however rest easy without his approbation and advise tho I know but little can be done for a person so far advanced. If there is any particular direction You would wish to give should her date of Life be closed by this sickness, You will inform me. I should be desirious of complying with every request and I shall not fail of writing to You by the next post   "
"Quincy  30 Janry. 1794
","My dearest Friend Our Parent is not worse, and I would flatter myself that She is something better. You will let Brisler know that his wife is yet about and well. Enclosed is a Letter to  from Mr. Newcomb our Mason who requested me to get the Bills inclosed Loand for him I told him I would forward them. They are inclosed not to evade the postage but for security. We are all well in the Family.  "

","My dearest Friend We have had a severe Snowstorm but attended with such a  wind that half the ground is bare, whilst the other is almost impassible Banks; I hear nothing from Town this week, even the post has not come, but I have good domestick intelligence for You, which is that this day I think our Parent better, and I am much encouraged. She says with one of her smiles, tell my Son that I am here pestering yet, and that I have the best daughter in the whole world. I am obliged to do the whole message or be undutyfull. We are all waiting with impatience to learn the purport of the last news from  France. It must be of consequence  to Electrify Congress in such a Manner that they could not keep their sittings. I have written only a few lines, least I should not be able to get my Letters in town soon enough for the post; on Monday, Captain Beals is kind enough to call this evening and let me know that he is going to town tomorrow, and could take Letters for    "
"Quincy  Febry. 2, 1794
","My dearest Friend I last Evening received  your kind Letters of  18 ,  20   and 22d  accompanied with the Negotiation's. I have read the two pamphlets You sent me before. If the American pamphlet is the production of the person to whom report ascribes it, I think very little honour is due to his Head, and none to his Heart. I am sorry he is calld to fill so important an Office, as the one to which he is lately appointed. His Ideas are many of them derived from the Gambling Table and his allusions from a Brothel which he coarsly distributes without respect to his readers. He might not imagine that his subject would draw the attention of a Female reader Yet he who respected himself would have been more delicate, if the Ideas had not been too Familiar to him, and his uncloathed Negroes had blackned his mind. I cannot give free credit to his representations respecting the Banks and funding systems, nor can I ascribe such dreadfull plats to those who have the management of them as this Modern Argus sees. That multiplied Banks are productive of many of those evil consequences which he enumrates I both see and feel, that many persons are making fortunes from them I believe, that they are an indirect tax upon the community, I fully credit, but his proposed remidy would be worse than the disease. His attempt at Wit and his affected ridicule upon the balance of power, proves his grose ignorance of a subject, upon which his Ideas, are all bewilderd, and Incoherent. It is plain however that this pamphlet is the continuation of the system adopted last Winter and Breaths the same spirit with Giles and his veterans.  The Letter addrest to Mr. Pitt, is well written, and contains matter of weighty concequence, and serious consideration, the writer accounts in the most rational Manner for that spirit of Frenzy and Madness which continues to swallow up reason, reflection and all the social affections and manly virtues, in the French Nation. Shakspear has well described these scenes too applicable to the present.  The warning to  Great Britain I have not read. Our Son brought  up one Saturday Evening but not having read it himself and being obliged to return it on Monday prevented my reading it. I wish it might be a sufficient Warning to us to continue our Nuetrality unimpared. The dull and gloomy weather I recieve had influenced Your Spirits, and the  of the day had made You sick. You wanted the repose of your Family and the Bosom of your Friend. I know how it was by your letter. Pupil of Woolsoncraft confesses the Truth, and own that when you are sick of the Ambition the intrigues the duplicity and the Treachery of the aspiring part of your own sex, it is a comfort and consolation to retire to the simplicity the Gentleness and tenderness of the Female charactar. Those qualities, says a candid writer are more beneficial to the human race than the prudence of all its individuals, and when conducted with good sense, approach to perfection. You can do much service to your Sons by your Letters, and advice. You will not teach them what to think, but how to think, and they will then know how to act. I am glad You have read Barnevelt, and do not think him too roughly handled. His Age only  him to any respect. He evidently felt himself in the back ground, and sunk out of sight, but secretly from the dark shoots a poisond Arrow. I shall attend to Your wishes with respect to  which can be done. The winter has been unfavourable for busines. The pond is hard enough frozen, if we had but sufficient snow to cover those parts of the Ground which are bare. The wood we get when practable, but I have made an important discovery viz that an old man is not a Young man. Belcher however is in every respects preferable but cannot be so active as when Young. He is not devoted to the Rum bottle. I informd You that I had recieved the Bills, and have dischargd the accounts of Phipps Samil and bought an other load of Hay. Paid to Mrs. Brisler ten  dollars which She had occasion for which You may mention to him. I have been to visit our parent who is low and weak I do however see any imediate danger, I hope the Phylidelphians will keep a viligent look out, and if the dreaded fever should break out, remove the inhabitants. The Rain or three days which I mentiond to You was warm and relexing to an allarming degree. It affected me so much that I was several days sick, and all the servants were debilitated in one way or other. It brought on your Mothers Illness and in many instances in Town a Lung fever. Mrs. Field now lies sick with it, Mrs. Brislers mother. Your Letters was the first intelligence I had of the return of Cheeseman. I shall make inquiry into the Matter. I received a letter last Evening for Mrs. Brisler which I sent to her. She was finely  the Boy is stout and strong.  "
"Quincy  Febry. 8th 1794
","My dearest Friend I was very sorry to learn by your last Letters that you had little hopes of getting home  May. There are so many new Arrangements to make upon our places that I really feel unequal to the Task, but if it must be so, I will do the best I can according to my Ability, and if I fail in the execution, You must at least allow for the intention. I would wish you to think what you would have done upon the several Farm's: Humphries is gone into the Country, and I doubt very much, whether Porter will not be so quidling that I shall not be able to agree with him. His woman is so weakly, and Maids are so nice now, that they cannot drive a Cow to pasture, &c I mentiond to you in a Former Letter that I had offers of several persons, and I have seen the Son, and daughters of the Richards Family, and told them my Terms. They have them under consideration; I have inquired their characters of Dr. Tufts and he approves of them. He thinks I could not do better. They are an able Family and have been used to a dairy upon a large scale. The Young Man is a shoe maker but would like to let himself for 6 or 8 months. The rest of his Time he would work at his trade. What his terms would be he could not tell, yet. Shaw came down last week to let me know that he and Alice had a mind to come and live upon one of the places, I told him my terms, not quite as liberal as those you agreed to Porter, and he will come if you chuse. He brought with him a Man by the name of Joy, a smart looking man who wanted to go upon a place, whose wife Shaw says, made 9 hundred weight of Cheese last year from six cows. As I considerd one of the places engaged to Porter, I did not converse with him only as I told Shaw that he might mention the Terms to him. I am  determind however that he Porter shall give me his answer in the course of a few days. Thayer removed this week, and Shaw would come by the first of March. Faxon does not go of till sometime in April which will be inconvenient on some accounts, as the Team would be usefull to us for much business before that time I had thoughts of letting Shew; if you approve come into that Thayers House by the first of March; and as he will not have any Stock to look after, to employ him here to Tar trees, and in such other business as we have to do, or I will put him off till the first of April if You think best. If we keep a dairy only upon Thayers place, It will be best to place the Family there, who are the most accustomed to a large dairy and will not think much of the work.. If we divide and keep a dairy, upon both places; Shaw may be first at either place, as he is now a good deal used to a Farm. If you thought it best not to commit either place to Shaw he would like to come down, and take Part of the H  [ . . . ]  in which Faxon, is and let himself here by the Year upon this place to Work occasionally upon either. I wish you to consider of all these matters. Here is Arnold and Copland, as jealous or each other as two ministers of state, each of them eager to be employd and Watching the Motions of each other I have not had much occasion for either, but that their Rivalry might not be too great, have employd them alternately. If Young Stock is to be Purchased what Month will it be best to send out for it? If cows the begining of April will be the best season. Dr. Tufts gave 18 dollors last week for a cow to calf in March. Do you suppose to sow grass-seed with the Barley? and what kind suppose I could get it. I  Thayer Cheese press, Other things he took with him. Cheesman is in  South Carolina instead of  Boston. He has just escaped with his Life  every thing.   Both he his Mate, and a Boy were washd over board. They rescued the Captain and Mate, but lost the Boy. I fear your Trunk will be in bad plight if you ever get it. He lost every Article of of deck. I wish my dear Friend I could tell You that our parent was essentially better, but that would be flattering You further than I dare. Her strength daily declines. Her coughs is in some measure relieved. She does not suffer pain but I do not think she will ever go abroad again. She may continue in this Way, for some weeks, and she may sink in less than one. I know you would not permit your Brother were you here to be at  which sickness necessarily occasions in a Family. Such as an extra fire, Candle Light, and other necessaries. I have attended to these things as well as to every comfort She may want, and would as far as in me lies that she should not feel the want of an own daughter who has so well deserved in all her children. Her Granddaughters are very attentive and good. I have been with her every day when have been well enough to |go out, and shall so long as her Life is spaired I am however fearfull of this Month on my own account, as two years it has been very unfortunate to me. Adieu. I am just going to your Brothers. Col. Thayer departed this Life yesterday. Mrs. Brisler and Child are well, but Mrs. Feild is very dangerously sick.   "
"Quincy  Feb'ry 12th 1794
","My dearest Friend Yours of the 26th of   I received last evening. You talk of not rising till june. Why I know not what I shall possibly do. Every Farm to Man, and with hands perhaps that I am unacquainted with, a scene of Business quite distant from me. When my Garden and Potato Yard are quite enough for me to attend to, why I shall have to travell from one farm to the other, and not bring much to pass neither I fear without proper overseer. We shall want a Farm Horse before that time and I know not what else, but there are many things to be thought of and those in season. I cannot but hope however that you will not sit later than May, at furtherest. You will attend to my request in my Letter of the 10th. We have got two Lambs already. The Animals in the Yard have all had the Mumps I believe. One of them I thought we should have lost. He was so sweld in his Throat that for a Week he never eat a mouthfull and could not lye down. The poor creature set up on his hind legs and slept. I cured him by having his Throat rubd with Goose oil daily.   Belcher has made them a yard of about 20 foot square inclosing their House and it is full of sea weed. The black animal never would fat and I finally lost him from the misfortune he met with. Grain continues very high corn at 5 and Rye at 6/8. Hay from seven to Nine shillings. The two Houses cannot agree upon an answer to the  Speech. They are quite puzzeld. French influence appears to be going out of fashion, and daily losing ground. The democratick societies are dwindling down. You will read in Russels's paper some admirable observations addrest to the  Phyadelphia Society taken from Minerva.. Adieu my dear Friend. How can I reconcole myself to the idea of not seeing you till june. The terrors of the fever will haunt my imagination. You must not tarry there so long. Remember me affectionately to all inquiring Friends. Thomas will not get his Boots this winter. Poor Cheesman was torn all to pieces, and starvd almost to death. There are letters from him.   "
"Quincy  Feb'ry 14th 1794
","My dearest Friend I received last evening by my obliging  Captain Beats  Your kind Letters of Febry. 4th  , and before I reply to them I would inform You that our venerable parent has appeard to revive for these two days past, her disorder has proved a Lung fever. The Dr. advised to a puke two days ago. She was rather averse to it, wishing rather as She expresst herself to dye in quiet. She had labourd under a great sickness at her Stomack which made her loath both food and medicine. It appeared to me likely to give her relief and I urged her to it promising to attend her through it. Well She replied if you say so, it must be so. The Girls when they bring me any thing, do not say the Dr. says You must take it, but Aunt Adams says so, and then they are sure it will go down. We accordingly gave the puke and it opperated kindly, since which She has rested better, expectorated freer, and for the present appears relieved. She inquired of me a few days since if I had written to you of her sickness. I told her that I had. She took me by the hand, and bursting into Tears, give my Love and blessing to him. I shall never see my dear Son again."" I am happy in having so far anticipated your reqest as not to have given Your Brother occasion to expend a shilling upon her account. I have mentiond to you in a Letter already forwarded what I had done. Should the Melancholy event which we apprehend take place I shall punctually adhere to your directions. Such I presumed they would be and that led me to ask them, and further I had thought to remove the venerable Remains to this House, as it might be considerd on additional respect to them to have them intered from hence. These circumstances will remain in my breast only, unless circumstances call them into action. I received by this Post 30  pounds. As the drought was forwarded to our Son, and You made no mention of it in your Letter I am at a loss to determine whether you forwarded it towards the discharge of Pratts account, or whether You conceived I might have occasion for it, for purpose mentioned in your private Letter. Having  as you will see by a mem. inclosed discharg'd some debts upon the receipt of the former Bills I have not at present sufficient to spair to make up the 20 dollors, more upon the account, without straining myself more than I chuse, not because I have expended the other 30 , but because I have lent half of it. A vessel arrived from Germany loaded with 18 thousand Calf skins, of a superiour quality and 2 shillings lower than they are to be purchased here. Boilstone was desirious of procuring a couple of hundred and for that purpose I lent him 50 dollors to make up his Sum. I wish it had been in my power to have lent him 500. Deacon Webb, purchased 16 hundred of the same skins, kept four hundred for his own use, in less than a week sold the remainder with an advance of only sixpence upon a skin, cleard his own four hundred and put a thousand crowns in his pocket. That is doing business to some purpose. I have laid by the money and if I should not be obliged to appropriate some of it, as I fear, it shall be paid to Pratt. The tarring of Trees will speedily commence. I must take Arnold into service. I pray your directions upon the subject of my two last Letters. I wrote to Brisler to inquire the price of Oats and Rye. Belcher was in Town this week but he could not purchase oats at less than three shillings and Rye at 8. When You went away, almost three months ago I had only three Gallons of Rum remaining of what Brisler bought. That has anwerd till this time, but as soon as my spring Work commences I must make large recruits. The Political part of your Letters I must defer replying to till the next post. Mrs. Field is upon the Recovery. Mrs. Brisler and Family well, but since I have  from  Philadelphia so many persons have not been sick in Town and Children, appear to be voilently attacked with fever. I have happily yet escaped any confinement.    "
"Quincy  circa 20 February 1794
","My dearest Friend The post of the last Saturday was the first for a long period, which  of bringing me a Letter from you, I should have been more anxious but then I received one from You on the Wednesday preceeding: You say so many handsome things to me regarding my Letters that you ought to fear making me vain. Since however we may appreciate the enconiums of the World the praises of those whom we Love, and esteem, are the more dangerous because we are led to believe them the most sincere. When I read in your Letter the communication made you by Dr. D. I drew a very different conclusion from it, from what he did. I believe the P. had some hint of the writer or certain peices and was led to make those inquiries respecting the master, and the pupil that he might the better Judge, whether the pupil was alone capable of writing them. I am much better pleasd that this should have been his object, than the appointment Mr. D. suggested have taken place. If I have pride, and Ambition. It would not have been gratified by that for instead of benefiting, or advancing our Son, it would have Created envy, injured him in his present prospect of increasing buisness and have been a feather whose point would have proved a sting. He has acquired to himself by his Writings his abilities and his general Character for information a Reputation which his enemies fear and which cannot be combated by any imputation upon his Life and manners. Americanus is so sensible of this that he thinks it better to appear upon Friendly terms that otherways. I wish I could impute to this Man any thing, but sinister views. The Two Gentleman were engaged in an Insurence cause before Referees lately,  a Cause of considerable consequence in which a vessel and Cargo were involved. The vessel was sent to the  West Indias and there lost. The Cargo was put on board a Spanish vessel and was captured by French privateers. The Question was; were the underwriters liable for the Cargo. In the course of the Argument, this learnd gentleman, advanced that by our Treaty with  Spain such and such things were stimulated. Not by Treaty Sir replied his opponent. Still he went on either really through Ignorance or wickedness, with our Treaty with  Spain. No Treaty, Sir, I beg Your Pardon Sir, we never had a Treaty with  Spain. The cause was finally adjudged in favour of the defendents, very fully. A few days after  [illegible]  Mr. S--n sent to request the favour of speaking with A-s. He went. Nothing could exceed his Servility I must call it. I wish Brother A to engage you in a cause with me. The circumstances are so and so. I am much engaged at present in the impeachment of Mr. Hunt, and I wish you to take the whole charge of it upon yourself. So saying he gave him a handsome fee and they parted. What a Character?  Prince Edward saild last Sunday. He sent his Aids to visit the L--r Governour but would not go himself. He dinned with Mrs. Hancock and was visited by many gentlemen in town. He went to the Assembly with Mr. Russel, and danced with Mrs. Russel. He went to visit the Colledge, but I did not hear that he had any Curiosity to see  Bunker Hill. He related an Annecdote at the table of the English Consul, As he was comeing from  Queebeck he stopd at an Inn, where an elderly Countryman desired to see him. After some bowing &c the Countryman said, I hear You are King Georges Son. They tell me so said the Prince. And pray how do you like this

 Country. Why very well replied his Highness. And how do you think your Father lik'd to lose it? Why not half as well as I should like to live in it replied the Prince which answer pleasd the Countryman. I hear he took Notice of all the French Refugees, and offerd any of them a passage with him to the  West Indias. His stay here was very short and it was best it should be so. There are new  prevailing that  Touloun is recaptured &c. It is said to be one of the enigmas of Pythagoris,  ""When the winds rise, worship the Echo,"" which has been thus interpreted: When rumours increase, and when their is abundance of Noise and Clamour, believe the second report. If Congress had attended to this, they would not have been sported with for their credulity. You will be sick enough of  by next May I fancy to long after Your Rocks and Hills, and I shall be sick enough Hills and Rocks by that time to wish you joy of them, and that you may like Popes happy Man, be  ""Content to breath your Native Air, on your own Grounds."" Those who can be usefull in all States, are compared to gentle streams, that not only glide through lonely valleys and forests, amidst the flocks and the Shepherds, but visit populous Towns in their course and are at once of ornament and use. You hinted in a former Letter as  a Friend of our was panting after something. I wish he would seek the substance and no longer grasp a Shadow. I most not close this Letter without informing you that  remains much in the State as when I wrote last. Exhausted nature appears to be seeking repose  and the sitting sun will go down calmly and serenly, and rise to a more perfect day, freed from the clogs of Mortality which now encumber it. For that inevitable lot may You and I my dear Friend ever be ready is the Ardent Prayer of   "

Feb'ry 26 1794   Quincy","My dearest Friend Not receiving any Letters on Saturday evening I was so impatient that I sent James to Town on Sunday afternoon, and he brought me home  your kind  of the 8th   9th   and 10th  of this Month; I do not omit writing to you once a Week, and sometimes twice. The  King of Prussia said that every age must commit its own follies, and that the experience of other was but of little benifit to them.  ""National curruption must be purged by National Calamities. A real reformation is not to be accomplish'd by ordinary means; it requires those extraordinary means which become punishments so well as lesson's,"" were the observations of a great Politician: whether  France will ever emerge from the horrid scenes, that deluge her with carnage, havock, and Blood,  ""is in the dark Gloom and abyss of Time."" There present Situation is well pictured in the following line. You ask me what Mr. Wibird says now to the French. He says that he believes that they will all go to the devil and that they deserve to, but still insists that they never would have gone to, such  lengths if they had not been invaded and driven to desperation by foreign powers, and that future generations will be benefitted by their calamity The abuse upon the President which You mention, but which I do not see, proves that the most virtuous and unblemishd Characters are liable to the Malice and venom of unprincipald Wretches. Such Virtues such disinterested Patriotism, when thus requited, has frequently become Tyranical, and unless mankind were universallly enlightened, which never can be, they are unfit freedom nor do I believe that our Creator designed it for them. If such a Boon had been designed for them, all Ages and Nations from Adam to the present day, would not have been one standing continued and universal proof to the contrary. Some were made for Rule others for Submission, and even amongst my own Sex this doctrine holds good. History informs Us that of the few Queens who have reigned for any length of Time as absolute Sovreigns the greatest part of them have been celebrated for excellent Governours. Pliny, tells us that in  Marve, Women rained for many succesive ages, among the Lacedemonians, the woman had a great share in the political Government; and that it was agreable to the Laws given them by Lieurgns. In  Borneo, the Women Reign alone, and their Husbands enjoy no other privilegde than that of being their most dignified subjects; but as Reigning and Ruling is so much out of fashion, at the present day. My ambition will extend no further than Reigning in the Heart of my Husband. That is my throne and there I aspire to be  absolute.  You will see in the Centinal a very vapid answer to a very vapid speech, and the estimation in which it was held, by the committee appointed to carry it. I have read with pleasure two very Judicious papers in the Centinal taken from a  Phyladelphia paper under the signature of Americanus. Such writers are wise and salutary; I have  your Message to Your mother. She bids me tell you that She leaves You her Blessing, that She request your Rememberance of her to the Throne of Mercy, that She is hastning to an other and a better Country, where she hopes one day to meet you, but that here She shall never see you more, and of this opinion I am daily more and more, as her decay becomes more and more visible. A few weeks if not days must put a period to a long and to a very irreproachable Life. My constant attendance upon her has very much lessend my desire of long life. Her fears least she should recover and become useless, her appearing to have out lived every enjoyment, shews that life at best is but a poor play, and the best that can come of it, it is a misirable Benediction. These Reflections exclude any further addition to my Letter, than the sincerest which   "
March 1," My dearest Friend I Yesterday received   . I was attending at the sick Bed of our dear Parent, from whence for six weeks I have been seldom absent unless a Nights; my Health would not permit me to be with her then. She You will find by a letter recieved before this date, had anticipated your wishes, and sent You her blessing. Upon me She hourly bestows them, and I never quit her but with her grateful acknowledgements to me for every little attention I can render her even to giving me pain. She is weaker, her decline is gradual, but thank God She does not suffer severe pain. I have past through this Month without being confined as in two former years. I have had a Slight attack or two, but by taking an emetick it went off. I cannot feel sufficiently thankfull as I have been enabled to  ""Make langour Smile, and Smooth the Bed of death."" I sent your  to John I should like to puzzel You as much I have not said a word of the late movements in  Boston. As he was upon the Spot, I supposed he would give You an Accurate Statement of them. You will learn before this reaches, You that the Federalists carried their points, and by a very great majority. Not only this, but I was assured Yesterday that they were determined, that Honestus should quit the Senate and Jarvis the House at the next election, and that Judge Cushing should be Placed in the Chair. We shall soon see if they have the wisdom and power they claim. This meeting originated with the Jacobin Soceity who have recieved a check from which they will not soon recover. I was much diverted with the account I received yesterday of a certain weather cock. The General Court were sitting upon the Impeachment of Hunt, and this person was obliged to leave the meeting to attend. When he went out of the meeting he was with the majority who were in favour of some resolves which past at a former meeting. During his absence the reasoning and Arguments of the Minority became so convincing that in poling for the vote the Minority had now  become the majority. Just as this juncture he returnd, and upon entering the Hall, he limp'd first to one side, and then to the other not knowing in the crowd what had happened, and finally fix'd himself in the minority, upon which an acquaintance, cry'd out  ""ah Jemmy thou are caught this time"" to the utter dismay of the Camelion You observe that Congress have done little Business, except preserve their Country from going to war. That is a Service inestimable in my account, and time and  have unfolded to this people the views and designs of Foreign Courts and Countries towards them, which will ultimately benefit them. I thank you for the Register which will be very  to me. I received Mr. Brislers Letter and Bill of landing. You will give directions what ground you would have saved and what planted with corn. I am now so full of Buisness that I scarcly know which to do first. I have 5 hands and two Teams employd in sliding the stone over the pond. We have had hard frosts, and now a slight snow of a couple of Inches which we are improving whilst it lasts. The Ground has yet kept so hard frozen that I have not heard of a single person who have begun taring. We shall begin with the first. We have a large Quantity of posts and Rails brought which as Belcher is so good a hand at making that he will go to it as soon as he can. We have not yet got all our wood home. Shaw I expect in about a week or ten days at furthest I shall place him at present upon the upper place Porter was not satisfied with the Terms you offerd, and I did not make any new ones to him. I cannot yet say who will go upon the other place. When the land is cleard and sweetned We may increase our stock. Cows and all stock is high. 18 and 20 dollors is the price of a good Cow. Faxon has two already calf'd, but I could not prevail with him to raise the calfs. We have one which is raising and 9 Lambs. We have not yet lost any, but We are obliged to feed the Sheep with corn. If Belcher thinks we can accomodate more cows here I will buy three as soon as I can. We have salt Hay in abundance. We cannot put any more stock upon the other place to feed with Hay, as the Hay must be divided upon the 20 of May and Faxon is very contrary, tho he does himself as he pleases. I had some trouble to get his Team for the buisness we are about.   We must hire the peice of land belonging to the Heirs of Thayers Sister. I think he told me that he gave four pounds the last year and that a Major Penniman is Guardian. I rather think We shall conclude to take the Man who accompanied Shaw and of whom Shaw gives a good Character, as upon Dr. Tufts inquiry respecting Richards it proved a Family different than the one he supposed it to be. I can have Joy if I chuse and upon the same terms with Shaw which is that of only finding Wood during the Summer. Young Stock must be sent out after. I shall have occasion for the following large Articles, a Load of English Hay some time in March a Barrel of Molasses and a hundred of Brown Sugar which would be best purchased soon, as their is a prospect for the fluctuating state of things that they will be much higher I have a prospect of 8 Barrels of cider. I should be glad You would let Brisler procure me a couple of Barrels of superfine flour and 50 wt. of loaf sugar which last will be a Years Stock for me. You will think whether it is best to send some porter round. Newcombs papers came safe. Arnold is with me and I shall engage him through the Month of March. There is no want of . I hope my Health may be continued and then I shall go through every care with pleasure provided I can give satisfaction.   "

","My Dearest Friend Half an hour ago  your kind Letters of  23   and 25  were brought to me. I was at my station the Bed of our parent when they were deliverd, who again renewed her blesssings with the Testimony of Your having been always a kind and Dutifull Son, my Duty towards her as your parent, and as excellent woman whom I love respect and revere shall in all points be fulfilld, but the scene is sometimes too much for me, and pains me to the heart, I will not afflict you by the recital, last Night an ulcer upon her lungs broke and discharged to day. She seems rather easier. I have left her just to return home and dine. Mr. Storor brought me your letters, and by his return to  Boston I have wrote you a few lines, I deliberated Some time whether I should write you at all till I could say our dear Parent was at rest. I now most sincerely Join with her in hopeing that the hour will speedily arrive for she has finished her course and done the work assigned her, and I doubt not She goes to reap the Reward of a well Spent Life, God Grant You the Suport and comfort You need  under a Bereavement which my next letter must to all be Humane appearance inform you of. Tell Mrs. Otis I will write her when my mind is more at ease. "
"Quincy  March 14 1794
","My Dearest Friend This Letter will not bear you so melancholy tidings, as from the close of my last, I apprehended.  Still lives; the ulcer which in my last, I inform You had broken upon her Lungs, and brought on the Symptoms of a Speedy dissolution; She had Strength Sufficient to Grapple with; all day on Sundays, we expected every moment would be her last, but She fell in to a quieter Sleep; and was revived with it; and has to the astonishment of her Friends Survived an other Week. Her cough has again become very troublesome, but She is not so distresst as She was: and may continue for some time to come. She is loth we should think her better: tomorrow will be her Birth Day; when She will commence her 86th year, Since She was taken Sick, She has seen and heard of 5 person in her Neighbourhood carried to their Graves; it has been very Sickly here. Mrs. Bass who lived in our House was buried this Week; She died of a mortification occasiond by a Rupture which She had for Several Years, and not properly attended to. Mr. Seth Batters wife, and Mrs. Prey of a Lung fevers and two children. The weather has been so warm for three days, this week, that I could not but be anxious for my  Philadelphla friends: I fear the late Intelligence will oblige Congress to  long. What can be done with that mad and I may say unjust Nation? If they force us into a war with them  George will deserve a Second time, to lose his Head; so sure as he provokes  America into a war, so sure he will lose his crown. Heaven avert from us so distressing a calamity but there is a General Gloom and distress amongst the mercantile People. Our people commened War against the canker worm, the 2 day of March. We were the earliest in Town, and we have already Slain our thousands, other people are but just , Mr. Black yesterday, I have Sent to Town for an other Barrel of Tar. Yet they use it more prudently than the last year. The Season is not so forward by a fortnight as the last year, the Roads have been so bad the frost just comeing out of the Ground, that Shaw is not yet come. I expect him in a few days -- and have agreed to take Jay, and family. I shall want 5 cows. I can not hear of any under 20 dollors a peice. I Sent last week by a person going into the country after Stock for cows and young cattle. He returnd without getting any with word that they were dearer there than round, here. I Shall want pails Tubs pens hoops and the whole Apparatus for a dairy a Cheese press excepted which I bought. I will Send out the begining of April for my cows, Belcher Says we can keep them here, being well provided with Salt and fresh Hay. We shall be obliged to purchase an other ox, for the other place, by Faxons movements, for he has bought on a match for that hoe had last fall; and a young Horse by which means he makes a Team up for his Son to work with, he is  a Sad, and I fear a: dishonest Man. I Shall be, glad when we are rid of him; I have purchased 8 Barrels of cider; and I have engaged a Barrel of Rum, and a Barrel of Molasses, a hundred of Sugar as every article is rapidly rising in concequence of the detention of our vessels and the Ruin of our trade; Some other articles I have omitted least I should plunge too deep; I have engaged an other load of Hay. Tis a Sad expensive thing to have to feed Sheep 4 months with corn and English Hay. I make my Boys with one Man Tar for the most part; as soon as the front is out, we Shall finish breaking up the peice of Ground for corn. I Should like to know whether you design to Break up any New Ground at the other place, or plant over again part of what Faxon broke up last Year. I long to have the places arrang'd. Gardening will soon come on. I wish Brisler could Send me Some willow Trees. Tell him I Saw Mrs. Brisler, and his Boy this Week. Both are well, and the Boy half grown a very fine child. I have been once only at my Sisters for near Nine weeks. Adieu my dearest Friend, Heaven preserve You in Health and return you in Safety to  The Hayseed not yet arrived.  "
"Quincy  March 17th. 1794
","My Dearest Friend I received  your two kind  last Evening of March 2d  and 13th, the Seasons I belive have been very near alike both here and with you. We have had Several days of warm and muggy weather, the Ground thawing the Slug and Miller very industerous, and as the scripture assures us that tis Lawfull to do good upon the Sabbeth, my people are employd in annoying these destructive Enemies, who make not the Sabbeth a day of rest; I hope our care and early attention will put an effectual Stop to their career. Our Neighbours are pretty generally taking the Same precaution, tho they have been too neglegent of the Season; I wish you to enable me as soon as possible, to Send out for Stock. Cows are in such demand that they rise in price every day. Mr. Randolph is after 20, and Many others are in quest of them. I should have Sent the comeing week if I could. I am much  at your loss. As I know not how to help myself here I want about 3 hundred dollors. One hundred and 50 I Shall Send out for stock. We cannot expect to get Cows under 20 and Some have been sold at 23 Dollors. We have two calves which we are raising. I have got a Barrel of Rum and a Barrel of Molasses a hundred of Sugar, which come to 54 Dollors.  All these articles have risen since I first sent to ask the price of them. I want 50 Weight of Coffe and Some Chocolat. I wish to know whether you would not think it best to, get an other Barrel of Rum? There is a Strong talk of a General Embargo. Whether Congress have Such an object in contemplation I cannot tell, but trade is much distress't. Rye has fallen in price and as the Spring advances will be Still lower, of that I would purchase 12 Bushel flower for what reason I cannot tell has risen three Shillings in a Barrel, veal is currently Sold at 6 pence pr pound good Mutton and the best of Beaf at the Same price So that the Farmer need not much complain. Hay keeps up at 7/6 and 8 Shillings and Butter at 1/4 pr pound. These things must soon fall, If the Spring comes forward with a good prospect. Cider I bought, drawn of at 2 Dollors pr Barrel, which is Said to be as cheep as 10 Shillin would have been in the fall, considering the Waste there always is in a Barrel. What you mention respecting L n I am Sorry to learn. I always had a good opinion of him. Poor  Nature, How few of thy ospring are ""firm and steady to their trust, inflexible in ill and Strictly just."" I never knew so little of what was passing in Congress. We have only mutilated  and as to the Senate we are not informd of a Single movement. How was Gallitan Election determind? I am like to be in trouble in my own Family. Polly Howard is taken Sick with the prevailing Lung fever. I hope a well  bleeding may Save her. I have hopes of the Recovery of our parent.  ""Let none despair She Says, if I recover, it may be calld a Resurection from the Dead."" I cannot Say She is out of Danger, but She is certainly better, tho her cough is still very bad, and She is extreemly weak and low. My Love to . I have so many cares upon me that I do not get time to write to him so often as I wish. I am my dearest Friend   "
"Quincy  March 22 1794
","My Dearest Friend Yours of March 11th   me yesterday. I have the Satisfaction to announce you our parents Life, her complaints graduly decrese, her Health appears to be languidly returning, and last night for the first, She passd without a Watcher. Nine Weeks She has been confind, but as her disorder of Body gives way, her faculties which all along during her Sickness seemd Brightned, appear to be impaird, which is often the case in Younger and Stronger persons. She now hopes to be Spaird to see you once more. My own Family is very Sick. Both my Girls confind with this Lung fever. Polly Howard got better, but too Soon exerting herself got cold and is worse than at first. We have had very warm weather for Several days, uncommonly so for March. The Grass is turning Green and, to day we have a fine rain, we have taken advantage of the weather and finishd the breaking up, the Slug and Millar are thought to be in greater plenty than usual. We have not omitted tarring every day. I went this week to See the new House and Farm, the House I found in Such a State as to require imediate attention. Like the Augean Stable it wanted a River turnd through it, to do them justice they had engaged to have it cleand, but the woman never did it. I Sent a couple of Hands and it took them two days to make it decent. There are a  dozen Squares of Glass out, and some small matters which want to be put in order without. I went into the Barn and out buildings which are convenient and I think the purchase not a very dear one considering the Buildings. Thayer drove all his Stock into the country in November and Sold his Hay so that there is very little manure, not much more than will be wanted to put upon the peice of Ground which was planted last year to corn, and must now be Sown to Barley; you direct to plant again Faxons last Years corn; Field, would not it be better to break up a few acres mare, and Sow down a part of what was last year planted. I wish to execute your commissions directly, respecting Stock, but it will not do to Send out without the needfull. I have been up to Faxons to examine what I Shall want for both places for the Dairy. Pratt I find were out every thing they had, and what Faxon has belongs to them excepting a cheese press so that I shall have occasion for 6 Dozen milk pans 6 crem pots 8 milk pails 2 cheese Tubs and Baskets 2 churns Hoops &c. Some more Tools will be wanted. Thayer has a pr of Broad wheels. Would you take them? Wanting Hay and oats I have been obliged to apply to the Dr. for 15 pounds. My workmen want their pay weekly, and the Spring opens new wants daily. We have had a subscription for purchaseing a new  [illegible]  path which was much wanted, the cost of which  
Page 3
 was 60 dollols. I gave 5 towards it, the Subscription was soon filld and the purchase made, is there any prospect of your Grass Seed, or is it all gone. Let me know as I believe I can get Some in  Boston. The Genett party the Jacobine club are trying for  civic feast in  Boston, but I believe will not  Succeed with only their own party. Every article of foreign produce is risen a Quarter higher. We hope you are all  in doing much good but we know very little what.   "
"Quincy  March 26th 1794
","My Dearest Friend Our two Tenants are come, and I have occupation enough. I have Set them to clear the Manure out of the Barn and to  the Garden put all the wall up and look to the fences, when that is done, I Shall Send, them to clear up the Bushes in Curtiss pasture. I hope you will not be detaind longer than the Month of April. You will be weary of hearing of my wants, and of Supplying them, but I find we want for the Two Farms a Wheelbarrow for each place 2 Spades 2 forks 2 Shovels 2 axes 2 hoas, I shall order two more Stu B Sythes immediatly. Each place must be Supplied for it will not be working it right to carry from this place those articles as at present, we are obliged to, and Still worse to Borrow. I Shall Buy 50 Weight of clover and a few quarts of Herds Grass Seed. I wish you to Inform me whether for the corn land which is broken up here, the manure is to be Spread as the last year. Belcher is of opinion that as the land is cold it would be better to manure in holles. I am waiting for a Remittance to proceed with courage. Mrs. Brisler, too want one to let her have Some money, or you had better let Brisler have it for her, but I Shall let her have 5 dollors as I promisd it her. For myself I have Spent only 2 dollors and half through the winter and that was for shoes. The whole of the Family expences are upon my Books. Arnold seems so desirious of continu -ing with us, that I think to hire him for 8 months, or by the Year if you think best. We continue our  Labour of tarring. How long it is to hold I know not, but it will be necessary to get an other Barrel of Tar, as the animals are so thick as to oblige them to lay on plentifully every day.  continues much in the Same State as when I last wrote you. She is a mere Shadow but the wonder is that that She lives. She has been led out of the Room twice. Yet I See no more reason for going to war with  England than with  France, nor indeed so much, for  England does not pretend to give us the Fraternal kiss and Judas like betray us,  I own want of power only to resent their injuries would restrain me, if negotiation Should prove unsuccessfull. The civic feast  in Smoke. None but the democratic club would unite in it. I have not Seen our Son for a long time, so that I cannot tell you So much about it as I wish.  I have  this afternoon that the L. Govenour assured the Jacobines who waited upon him requesting his attendance to the civic Feast, and that he would order out the Militia that their request Should be complied with, when the real Merchants and principal people found that the Government was to be drawn in; they had a meeting, axed Sent a committee to remonstrate to the Governour, assuring him that it was in direct voilation of their Solemn engagement to remain Neuter; and that if any Such thing was attempted more than a thousand of the inhabitants would remonstrate against it; he was much allarmd and Said he would use his endeavours to prevent it. The Chronical ascribes it to the distress of the Town and the deplorable Situation of the Trade! Misirably reduced indeed that not even one Solatary Dollor pr head could be furnishd: poor Spirited wretches.  What Shifts to Support an abhored System. I must request you to hasten me Some money. My  is much impeeded at this time through want of it. I know the reason has been the Delay of the Appropriation Bill.  "
"Quincy  March 28 1794
","My Dearest Friend I last Evening received  Yours of March the 15   and 17th  together with the Money you remitted, it was very fortunate in its arrival, for in half an hour after, I had two fine cows  me which I immediatly purchasd tho I gave 40 dollors for them, the Sheep Lambd so early, and my cows came in so early that we have expended more english Hay than I could wish, and they Rob'd my Horses to feed the Sheep. The oxen upon Faxons place will be very little able to work when he goes of, he has carted so constantly this winter and Spring that he has batterd the Waggon wheels all to peices, but why Should I perplex you with Domestick provocations, when you have so much trouble with the political Machine; you are certainly what they Term the make weight in the Scale -- which is a very important part, not so unimportant is your Station as You have sometimes represented it. I believe from all I can learn that War is a very undesirable object with the people of the  Eastern States, the Mercantile part, tho much opprest, became quiet, and determind to wait patiently the desision of Congress, the News of Yesterday, has given Spirits, and a Spring to every thing, the prospect of having  their vessels liberated, and their trade freed from the late embarressments together with the continuation of peace has defused a General joy. I would fain believe that  england will be too  of their own interest to continue their abuse and they will be induced to make all reasonable compensation. I hope your constant and Severe duty will not prove too hard for you. You may look forward to a charming Recreation and ample employ upon your Farms. I shall however do my best that nothing may essentially Suffer before your return, but I look round and feel as tho I could find employ for 20 Hands.  continues to be gradually mending, my own Family is getting better. I am too much occupied to have leisure to think myself Sick. Mrs. Brisler and Family are well. You will direct Brisler to give me particular information with respect to the furniture.    "
"Quincy  April 11th 1794
","My dearest Friend You I presume are so much occupied and fatigued with the duties of Your Station that You can get but little leisure to write, for of late I have received only a few lines at a Time from You; I hope We may not be driven into a liar but the present and past conduct of  Great Brittain has been such that Want of power and ability, are our greatest Security to ourselves and not the Humane Principal of Benevolence or Love of our Country, and  this Principal has a powerfull influence in the Breast of the Good and virtuous, it would not have power to restrain the passion of those who feel themselves inured and agrieved. You will see by the return of votes that Mr. Adams is undoubtly chosen Govenour by a large Majority of the people, and it is probable Mr. Gill will be Leut. Govenour. Judge Cushing stands high upon the list, but the cry of Gratitude towards an old Servant of the publick, whose Years could not be long, was powerfull, nor would they fix a Stigma upon him by placing an other over his Head. Their Principal was good, and I wish they may always act as wisely. Yet at this very critical Time, a more National and unprejudiced Man as well as a more active one, might have proved a greater Blessing to the State. Two of the counsel Daws and Wendle are good Men. Austin, I need not say what. He has the Mechanick Interest, and the art of making them believe   that he has some Brains. In the Counseld of the National Government the confidence of the people appears to strengthend and as the clouds thicken they look to them for counsel and direction. Thus much for politicks which amidst all my Rural occupations will find place in my mind. I will now as concisely as possible tell You my plan of . The two Tennants have been employd in putting the fences in order and in clearing Bushes in Curtiss pasture. Faxon would not remove a day before his lease expired which will be on twesday next. He has workd down the cattle in such a manner that they are not able to do much more. He has been breaking up ground with four cattle only. The Yoke he bought he takes off as I am advised by no means to give his price which is 21 pounds. The oxen are old. He makes out an account and leaves himself in debt only seven shillings. In this neither Stock, or Wagon are included. Yet he has used the Team constantly and beat out the Waggon Wheels. It will be impossible to go on with Buisness without purchasing an other Yoke of oxen, for there is a hundred load of Manure to cart out 9 acres of Hill to plow there and 1 acre and half at Thayers place. Faxon says there is three hundred load of Manure. I wish his words were true. Our people are plowing here and will sow next week. They suppose they shall have near a hundred load of Manure to cart out here. I have hired Arnold  again for 8 Months for the same we gave last Year, and an other Man for six Months for 45 shillings pr Month. Mr. Belcher leaves me the begining of May, to go to Mr. Cranch. Copland offerd himself to me to day by the Month, and I can have him at the same price with Arnold. Shall I engage him? The Season is comeing on as buisy as any in the Year and Shaw must have more help than one hand with him. I believe I shall hire Copland without waiting to hear from You. These hands are used to the place and the buisness, which makes some odds. I agreed with my Tennants upon the Terms You offerd Porter, with this difference. Instead of wood for the Year, only for the summer, and instead of 36 dollors for the dairy, with which he was not contented I give 30, but one request they have, that as they find themselves, and have Families they may have their pay Quarterly, and that I would advance them ten dollors a peice that whilst Grain is low, they may purchase. This I have agreed to, hopeing You will ratify all my proceedings. I am in Quest of oxen and a Farm Horse. One or the other I must have immediatly. Both are wanted. I was thinking that if  [illegible]   it would suit Mr. Smith to receive the freight of the furniture in  Philadelphia to request You to pay it to Captain Eames who will be there again in two or three weeks, and to let me retain in my Hands for the purchase of Stocks and the payment of my Labourers 
Page 4
 and the Suppliy of my Family, what You sent me. I have pay'd the expences of the landing carting &c. of it. We are now upon our sixth week of Tarring and the  still Crawl. A Tedious buissness it has been as well as an expensive one. I have  [illegible]   done more at the buisness than all the rest who have attempted it, in Town.  is slowly mending. This day for the first time since last Feb'ry I have been as far as  Weymouth, and in my absence much to my regret, Judge Cushing and Lady calld with a design to dine with me, and Mrs. Lavel and Mrs. Cabot came to visit me. Shall I ask You a Question You cannot answer? Why NO I will not since I know you will not remain a day after You think you can return with propriety, to "

","My Dearest Friend Your Letter of April 5th   and 7th   me last Evening, and they fill me with more apprehensions of a War than any thing I have before heard, the body of the people are decidedly against War, and if a War is madly or foolishly precipitated upon us, without the union of the people, We shall neither find Men or Money to prosecute it, and the Government will be Cursed and abused for all the concequences which must follow. I have many disputes with your Brother upon this Subject, whose passions are up, upon the insults, and abuses offerd us by  Britain, and who is for fighting them instantly with out Seeing one difficulty in our way in order to put a Stop to too rash Measures. Congress must rise, the people without are willing to wait the result of Negotiation as far as I can learn, and in the mean time we ought to prepare for the worst, Several vessels arrived here last Week from  Jamaca, where they were only carried for examination of their papers, and immediatly dismist. I most devoutly pray that we may be preserved from the  of War, and the Machinations of Man.

I am glad that we Shall have a Governour Elected by the people, and you will See by a Letter received from me before this time, how nearly we agree in Sentiment upon  this Subject, and I may adopt the words of Mr. Blount in a Letter to Pope,  ""that I have a good opinion of my politics, since they agree with a Man who always thinks so justly."" as you I wish it were in our power to persuade all the Nations into a calm and Steady disposition of mind, while Seeking particularly the quiet of our own Country and wishing for a total end of all the unhappy divisions of Mankind by party-Spirit, which at best, is but the Madness of many for the Gain of a few, and I Shall with pleasure upon this day particularly Set Apart by our Rulers, as a day of Humiliation and prayer, unite with them in wishing the temporal and eternal welfare of all mankind, how much more affectionatly then Shall I do it for You to whom I am bound by the Strongest bonds of duty and   "

","My dearest Friend A memorable day in our Annals, which is all I Shall Say of  here, the Season is very variable from hot to cold and cold to Hot, and much too dry; it has not raind since my poor furniture had such a Share of it, the Trees, just begin to Bud, and the ground to put on Some little verdure. Faxon moved off two days ago and Shaw removed in, we are getting things arranged as well as we can. I have purchased a Yoke of oxen (and an other cow for Thayers place). I have agreed to take the Waggon and the Bull at the apprizment tho much too high, the Yearling calves were apprized so out of Reason, at forty Shillings pr Head, that the Dr. thought best to take only our half. There has been Sad Havock made with the fencing Stuff by Faxon I Suppose. There will be no Hay to divide if there is enough to last till the 20 of May, which makes me rather Backward in purchaseing on two more cows, which will compleat the Number we want. Joy has the three Cows I have bought with him, and I removed Salt Hay from here for them, and bought half a load of Fresh, our Ground is all prepaird for the Seed and tomorrow we Sow. We have carted what manure we thought we could Spair upon the ground, first having it chopt over according to your old custom. Some of my Hands are daily employd in that Buisness, and in putting up the walls and   fences. I would fain hope that no one thing may be left undone that ought to be done, and that you buisness may Suffer as little as possible by your absence. You must make a large allowance in point of Buisness for Seven weeks constant tarring of Trees. Our Son Sees all your Letters when he comes to visit me which is not so often as I could wish. I believe he has his Share of . How profitable it is I know not.  has been with me this day. She rode out twice before, and She appears to recover as fast as a person 86 years old could expect to. She desired me to remember her kind Love to you, and to thank you for your good wife, to whom She bids me Say under providence She is indebted for the prolongation of her Life.  "" I have obeyd her directions, and expressd her Words."" Be calm as possible amidst the perplexities of State, nor let your Health Suffer. The Lord Reigneth, let the Earth rejoice. Love to .

","My Dearest Friend I last Evening received your of the 16th and our Son the Remittance, which he went directly to pay but Mr. Smith Says the Sum is this currency, when as Mr. Bisler expressly wrote me that it was  Philadelphia currency and after  the Sum in pounds, was so particular as to calculate the Sum in Dollors. Captain Eames has Saild for  Philadelphia so that Mr. Smith must wait unless he will credit Mr. Brislers Letter which I have now inclosed to Mr. Adams. I expected Captain Eames would have come up from the vessel before he went to  Boston, but the rain prevented him. I have no doubt however that Mr. Brisler who is generally accurate in Buisness did not leave this matter at an uncertainty. If Captain Eames Is in  Philadelphia when this arrives, he had better Sign with Brisler the agreement. I Shall do the best I can to make the Sum I have last till June. I have delayd any farther purchase of cows till May. They will do but poorly without english Hay after they have calved, and what Stock we have will empty our Barns of all but fresh Hay. One of the oxen you purchased last Summer has been Sick with the Yellows and horn distemper and unfit for Buisness this fortnight, so that the odd ox which Faxon left has been of use. Your Brother has a pr which after planting he talks of selling for 25 pounds, but will not take less. I gave for those which I purchased Sixteen pound ten but they were not in so good order, and older than his. I thought you would turn the Yoke of to fat which you bought last year as they had been so over worked, that as the Spring advances they fail. We have an ox calld the Twin ox which has a wen and tis supposed that it would be better to turn him off after the Spring work is over, but tis probable cattle may be purchased lower after the Month of May. We have the appearance of a dry time, a little rain to day, cold foggy weather. Our Barlly and Grass Seed are Sown. Our Men are employd in plowing for planting, at both places, but we have many wheals to Set in motion and much more to look after than we had before. I have not been absent from home a single day Since you left me. At length the canker worms have ceased and the catterpillar begins. I have had all the trees upon this place cleard once and I mean it Shall be done once a week whilst they appear, but I can promise only for this place. The work is so behind hand at the other place that we are driven with it. Shaw I knew to be a steady honest carefull Man. His wife I knew to be active neat and clever, the other I took upon Shaws recommendation, he is not bigger than Samll Curtis, but twice the Spirit and activity of Shaw, and it might have been more for our interest to have placed him here prhaps. He has a very likely woman for his wife to appearence, when he has worked here he has never faild being here by Sun rise. I have got an other Steady Soul

 who belongs to  Sandwich. I took him upon Captain Heals recommendation for whom he workd two Seasons and came up to let himself again to him, but the Captain having let out Squantum to a French gentleman for Six hundred Dollors pr Year, he did not want him, the captain Says he is faithfull diligent and Sober. I have no reason to think otherways of him. Would to Heaven you could retire from the Madness of Men to the Rural occupations of your own Farms, and Shut out the din of War and all its fatal . The voice of the landed interest is not for war and I dare Say it will be found a Sound maxim that the possessors of the Soil are the best Judges of what is for the advantage of the country. If an Enemy invades our country, every Man will rise for its defence, but when only the Mercantile property is Struck at, tho it ultimately affects the landholder Yet the Body of the people had rather Suffer than wage war and Ways and Means will be found more difficult than in any former War, or I see but little way.  France will aveng our cause, and we might resent when we are able, or punish them if we can without Suffering greater injuries than we can retaliate, Words are easy, but ways and means difficult to obtain,  I Saw Mrs. Brisler yesterday. She and Family are well.  "

","My dearest Friend I received  your two kind Letters of April 19th   and 22d . I was much gratified by the appointment of our Jay as Envoy . I know not how the president could have made a more judicious choice, but there are some evil spirits who would fault the measure of heaven and quarrel with the Angle Gabrial were he sent over to declare peace on Earth, and good will to Men. The Jacobine clubs who watch over the measures of Government, sent their clue to Honesty, hence the Chronical teams with abuse upon the  [ . . . ] , and clamours against the appointment of  [ . . . ]  Justice. I have been credibly informed that Austin  [ . . . ]  principally in the printing office and has seldom quitted it, upon thursdays and Mondays till 12 at Night, or rather upon the night preceeding the publishing of the paper. I presume if the Senate act with consistancy the Negative upon the non importation resolve will be as full as the vote in favour of sending Mr. Jay abroad, for I do not see upon what principal they can vote for the one, and agree to the other. You will see before this Lord Lansdowns and Earl Wycombs Speaches in the House of Lords, from which we may gather, that they are consious of the evils committed, and conscious for the consequences. After ways and means are devised I hope Congress will rise directly. Their resolve respecting the prohibition of British  manufactors, has already taxed the consumers twenty or thirty per cent, the rise of all foreign Articles has been very rapid. Many failures must be the concequence of the detention of our rebels by the depredations upon our Trade. Upon the 12 of this month a  of land upon which the widow vescy formerly lived is to be sold at Auction, 6 Acres. Tis expected that you will purchase it. The owner tacks a hundred and eighty pounds for it but as it is to be sold at Auction I have conversed with Dr. Tufts who does not think it worth more than ten pounds per acre. Yet to avoid bad Neighbours, he thinks I had better allow it to be bid up to 15 pounds but beyond that he would not advise me to go. I wish I knew your mind upon it and, whether you will think me distracted  [ . . . ]  price, The buildings are good for nothing, the land worne out, but still I should be loth to have a bad neighbour there. I wish you would inclose to me a card to Gen'll Lincoln, and ask him to send me the money if I should purchase it. The trees are very forward and we are like to have upon many of them a full blow. But the Season is dry. Tell Mister his wife and Family were well today.    "
"Quincy  May 10th 1794
","My Dearest Friend I received  yours of April 27th   and 30th  together with the pamphlets last Evening. Two of them from the Spirit they breathe denote their origin to be of Southern extract. They are a  with the attacks upon the Secretary made last year in the House. I have ever thought with respect to that Man,  ""beware of that Spair Cassius."" This might be done consistant with guidence, and without the illiberal abuse in many respects so plentifully cast upon him. The writers however discover too plainly that envy, pride and malice are the Sources from whence their opposition arises, in stead of the publick good. They are written in the Stile and Spirit of Honestus, a man [illegible]  Malice and dispassionate ambition. At bottom you and I know that in two Instances the Letter writes Lies. ""Most wicked by and from thence, if he could not be convicted on other instances. Yet we might Safely conclude that many things which he alledges against the Secretary are equally false, and I shall Say of the writer as the Son of battel says of Genet, that the Books which he abuses will outlive his malice and his  [illegible] Letters: the North and South appear to be arranged very formidably against each other on politicks and one Judas appears from this quarter too conspicuous for  for his honour, or reputation. Tis Said here that the Southern members have promised him the vice presidency the next Election if the Southern States force us into a War. I hope their Negroes will fight our Battles, and pay these real and haughty Aristocrats all the Service due to them, from the real and true republicans. The pamphlet upon prophesy I shall send to Mr. Cranch who has some time been upon the Subject, and told me not long Since, that he was persuaded we were entering upon the third War Trumpet. He has borrowed the last volms. of Gebeline lately which he is delighted with. When I have read the dreadfull Scenes which have past, and are still acting in  France, when I behold so numerous and powerfull an oration overturning all their old established forms both of Government and of Religion opposing and baffeling so successfully so many powers, and that under no Government, that deserves the name, I have been led to contemplate it, as no common or natural event, arising from the pressure of any increas'd burdens or any new infringment upon their priveledges, but the overruling hand of providence fulfilling great designs. It is the Lords work and it is marvelous in our Eyes. The  [?]of the cloud will pass over us and thankfull may we be if justice and righteousness may preserve us from its Artiliry. We are very dry, quite as much so as the last Season. I aim at no rivalship.  I only wish to fullfill my duty and pursue that which Shall be for our mutual advantage. Yet I fear I shall be deemed an unprofitable Servant and that some things will be left undone; which ought to have been done. I have the satisfaction however of thinking that I am more usefull here than I could be by residing at  Philadelphia. I have very little hopes to give you respecting our aged parent, who has had a relapse, and a very Severe one, but has Survived it, and is again better, mere Skin and bone, and unable to wacke a Step alone. Tis the decline of Nature aided by a long Sickness. Mr. Cranch has accepted the post office. I checke every rising wish and suppress every anxiousrising desire for your return. When I see how necessary you are to the welfare and protection of a Country which I love, and a people who will one day do justice to your memory the reflection however of always having done what you considered as your duty, will out weigh all popular breath and virtue be its own reward. Mr. Jeffry has sent me the english papers to the 6th of March, and I have been reading the parlimentary debates. The president must feel a pleasure & satisfaction at the justice done to his wise and prudent conduct, and the paid to his merit,  Britain has playd a  [knavish?] Game towards us, the extent of which, even those who condemn her conduct towards Neutral powers, do not appear to be fully  [apprizd ?]of, I see not but she must humble herself and that with the ruling powers in France, or be overwhelmd herself.

","My dearest Friend This day has been our May meeting and without clubs or even drunkeness,  we have little purity to boast of in that respect. Our Election has been calmly carried, and your Brother chosen. It seems the Name is in high estimation, as the Prophet Samll. find himself not only first but second, being Elected by the people both Govenour and Liut. Govenour which I believe is the first instance of the kind in this State. The Land I wrote you about was this day sold for more than a hundred pounds as your Brother informs me, and concequently I was out bidden. Dr. Phips purchased it, as your Brother supposes with an intention of Building upon it. The Town have agreed to sell the front seats in the Meeting House for pews, and Your Brother has told them that they shall have that in which we sit, for the use of the Age, at what it will fetch and he means to purchase for you one of the others. I tell him I chuse that upon the right hand. I suppose they will be high, as that of old Captain Beals was sold a few weeks ago at 40 pounds. Captain Beal will purchase one of them I presume. Dr. Bracket of this Town lies dead. He was getting into  and was much esteemed. Mr. Howard who Maried Your Aunt dyed last Saturday. Your Mother I think  is better than She was a week ago. We are extreemly dry here, quite as much so as the last Spring. We have but little News. If as tis reported Robert Spear is absconded from  Paris, some important change will take place in their affairs. He may however have a hydra Head. I see by the  N. York papers that the Gullitine has been advertized to be seen there. I think it should be as  ""advertized in  England,"" ""Here is to seen the Goulitine of the French, and the Wild Beasts."" I begin to expect your return, and one week of expectation will appear longer than a Month when I know you . I am sorry that the dry weather will give to my labours so unfavourable an appearence.   "
"Quincy  May 23d. 1794
","My Dearest Friend I last evening received  yours of the 12th   and 15 . The Weather for Several Days past has been  Hot, and as to the drought it is much than last year. We have not had half an inch of rain for two Months and scarcly Sprinkle for more than a month. Neither corn or potatoes can get up, and the few things in the garden wilt like July. I am most discouraged at Farming. I have however succeeded tolerably in keeping of the canker worm, tho some few have eluded all my vigilence. The caterpillars are also very numerous. Every day convinces me of the necessity of an over seer for all the Farms or some other pirates have made sad havock with the fence. We have already been obliged to carry up loads from here and every day new wants arise, and every neighbour is preying upon us. This place I can command but the other peice has been too long for plunder to be easily relinquished. We have attended to the Salt meddows, and been obliged to sit a fence against Jonathans pasture. The embargo is a very popular measure here and there is much anxiety least it should be discontinued. Flouer and Grain have risen in a few days as well as  Lumber. There will be Speculators whilst there is Commerce. The report respecting the Election of Mr. Adams is I believe wholy unfounded. I never heard such a suggestion. The people were much united on him, and those who did not wish him to be Governor voted for him as Lieut. Governor. The Jacobines have carried their prints so far as to get Several of their Friends chosen representatives for  Boston. The meeting was thin, and but little pains taken by the Friends of good order who always rest too Secure of the justice of their cause, yet having had a full view of Southern politicks and Southern Elections, I begin to think we are much the greatest part of the union, Much as  [they] hold  Britain in disdain and abuse her constitution, they have adopted the most pernicious part in the most corrupted Stage and a packe of Negro drivers, they deserve chains themselves. I think you must be near exhausted by the length of the Sessions and your constant attendance. I am glad to learn that  is gone into the Country upon a circuit. I hope he will get into Business.  remains much as she has been for some time past; Remember me to all inquiring Friends. Mrs. Brisler and Family are well, his Boy half Grown up.  I hope Congress will soon rise and that without doing any more mischief.   "
"Quincy.  May 24th 1794
","My dearest Friend Yours of the 17th  came this day to me. I do not know to what to ascribe the failure of my letters unless our son forgot to put them into the post office. I wrote you twice upon the very week of which you complain; and  I have not faild. writing to you once a week ever since you left me, I have not very often written twice. But some Business that week occurd which I wanted your opinion of. That Morton is chosen a Rep. is not more disgracefull to  Boston than that some others hold a Seat there, or than Austin is to the Senate but in concequence of their having such men they have as a Town, much less weight in the Legislature than they used to have, and the Federalists may blame themselves for their careless Supineness. I never approved of the measures adopted by them with respect to the choice of Governor, but they must have been much misrepresented to you. The contest if it may be called one was only between two candidates and that maintaind with more Decency and decorum than any Election in any State out of  N. England. Not a tenth part of the opposition to either which upon Several Elections I have known takes place. With respect to Hancock  and as to the report of free Negroes voting, I take it upon me to say tis Idle and false, as I never heard a Syllable of it. If you had been here you would have been surprised to find how little bustle there was about the matter. The people were generally disposed to Support Mr. Adams, (as the full vote he obtained will prove) either as Governor or Leiut. Governor and tho there was some News paper Strictures and Bilingsgate, yet there was very little of it. I suppose some of the stories have been fabricated to keep our virtuous Southern Brethren in countenance.  Boston has behaved very well in many respects, during the whole of these troublesome times, and their Democrats have not gone such lengths as in  [illegible]    New York or  Philadelphia. Jarvis frets and Austin clamours, scolds and writes in the Chronical abuse upon the Government and its Friends. Yet in  Boston all know who and what he is, and tis very little regarded. It appears to be the General Wish that the Embargo may be continued. If you Should Stay into June and be in a Situation to do it.I should like whilst flouer is low to have a couple Barrels of more flouer, that Britler sent me is very fine. I received a Book and letter for you . The Book is dedicated to you and is the History of the County of  Worcester by Revd. Peter Whitney of  Northborough.  The Letter is short and handsome. The dedication, may rather be called an inscription, after the Name and titles of office, is added,  ""This History intended to promote the knowledge of a part of his Native commonwealth is inscribed with all respect by his most obedient Humble Servant."" I have been much gratified in reading it. As you return home I wish you would get one of Thomas Bibles. He has printed three Editions and is preparing to print two others. The weather is cooler . A Small Shower yesterday in  Boston and  Cambridge of which we got not a drop has however coold the air. God Grant it may be our turn soon, or Man and Beast will Suffer. Hay is very generally expended, and the drought raises the price prodigiously. I am my Dearest Friend with the fond hope of giving you more than the Fraternal embrace, even that of an affectionate Wife  "

","Thanks to the Father of the Main, and the  dispencer of the den's of Heaven, who has plentifully waterd the dry and thirsty Earth, The Fields recover their verdure, and the little Hills rejoice, the drooping vine rears its head and the witherd flower Blooms anew. Indeed my dearest Friend it would rejoice your Heart to behold the change made in the appearance of all Nature, after one of our old fashioned Election storms as we used to term them. I hope we may be further  by repeated Showers. I this Day received yours of the 19th of May. I know not what became of the letter you mention. Such a one there was, nor do I recollect a Syllable of its content, excepting asking your advise  about the land which was the peice owned formerly by Margaret Vesey. I had 72 pounds bid for it, but it Sold at 60 dollars pr. acre and was purchased by Dr. Phips. I also mentioned that the Name of Adams might be Supposed in high estimation, since by the returns received we had reason to Suppose that our Governor and Leiut. Governor were of that Name. But one and the same Man. Your Brothers too had that day been chosen Mayors for this Town of which I informed you, but I do not recollect any thing further. I might write a string of Blessings upon the Democrats, their clubs, &c. but as nothing I could say of them is more than they merit they are welcome to make the most of it, and Chronical it, if they get it. ""You caution our Son to be reserved, prudent, cautious, and silent."" He is I believe all this. You did him curb his vanity. I know not whose praise would so soon tend to excite it, as one for whom he has so great respect and veneration, and whose judgment he so much relies upon. I will not say that all my Geese are Smart. I hope however that I have no occasion to Blush for the conduct of any of my Children. Perhaps I build more expectation upon the rising Fame and reputation  of one of them, than of an other, but where much is given, much shall be required. I know their virtues and I am not blind to their failings. Let him who is without cast the first stone. The Jacobines are very Angry that Congress leaves them at their Liberty, and permits them with their Eyes open to rush on to destruction. That they want Guardians is true enough, but no one obliges them to risk their property to French, British or Spanish pirates. Others I believe wish the Embargo continued from real patriotic motives. Speculation, has been going on rapidly. I understand the Term impatiently yours. But I had a good mind to be a little  and ask a Question, but I think I will only say that I am most patiently   "

","My Dearest Friend This is the first fair morning we have had since you left me. You must have had an  journey. Sunday the afternoon was pleasent, but Monday and tuesday very rainy. I was anxious to learn how the Election went in  Boston and sent to inquire last Evening of Mr. Black if he had heard from Town, and to my great satisfaction learnt that Mr. Ames was chosen there; by what majority I did not hear. The present post will however inform you. The Influence of the Jacobines has received a blow in concequence of it. Tis said Jarvis will lose his Senses. The publick will be no looser if that should be the case. Austin came forward in a publication last week with his Name in which he declares he will not stand a candidate in oppostion to Jarvis. Concequently all his party were united with Jarvises. You will want to know how the Farming business goes on. The orchard is all  with Sea Weed. As you desired, this day will compleat the spreading of it. About 90 Bushels of potatoes have been dugg at the two places. Today the Hands propose to finish the Beach Meddow. I am better than when you left me. So is Louissa. The Blister has proved very salutary in removing the pain from her . I shall wish to hear soon from you. I forgot to request 2 Barrels of flower by the first vessel. "

","My dearest Friend I hope you are  lodgd and that your Company will be to your mind. I rejoice in the reelection of Mr. Ames, and Mr. Smith of  Carolina. Tis said our Freeman is chosen for  Barnstable, a clasmate of our Son JQA , a Lawyer, a worthy Sensible Man as I have heard. For this district Mr. Meed I hear is chosen. I do not however approve of Clergymen becoming politicians. You may make a chaplin of him. I hear however that he is an ingenious Sensible Man. Mr. Dexter tis thought is not yet chosen, owing to their being several persons voted for. A large number of votes for Mr. Gerry who did not wish to be considerd as a candidate and whose influence will be given to Mr. Dexter should a Second vote be necessary. I have read Mr. Munroe  in the National assembly!!! Charmed with the Stability of their counsels: What a conscience. The Translater may be in fault. Every minister could not have made such a speach. You wish to know how the Business proceeds. Savil Nightingal and Bracket have been constantly casting . They have brought Sufficient to compleatly cover the orchard. It is not yet all Spread owing to the potato which has taken of Some of the Hands, and will take they tell me, two days more to compleat. I inclose you a journal of the Business of every day Since you left me. I Set out tomorrow for  Haverhill, leaving the weeks business agreed upon with Shaw. I hope to return on fryday, and by Saturdays post to hear from you. Do not let Brisler omit my flouer. It has risen here to 52 Shillings. Remember me to all inquiring Friends. Thomas thought Mr. Brisler had best send round his Bed and what things he left. I forgot to mention it to him, He will, judge whether it is best to send them now or in the Spring. Julia has Scarcely got upon the settee Since you went away. She however retains her affection for the Bed.  "

","My dearest Friend I received by Saturdays post yours of  8th, and was happy to find that you had got well to  Philadelphia, and that there was a fair prospect of Peace on all Sides. I was fear full that they would make a Senate before you reachd  Philadelphia. But his conduct is much like the Man, unsteady and wavering. The Democrats have found a Spirit in the Body of the people too enlightened, and too sensible to their own happiness, and the Welfare of the Country, to second their views, in the manner they flatterd themselves. Mr. Ames's Election has dampd their Spirits here; and tho Jones upon the Stage in pasts month, in the character of a servant, who was puzzling his Wits for his masters Support, Breaks out, that he knew not what to do now unless to invent Lies for the  Boston Chronical, (Ben still goes on lying) This peace of wit, in the actor, produced a roar of Laughter through the whole house, which was followd by a Clap in unison, and proved more fully than fifty essays the estimation in which that paper is held. Tis said Genll. Shepard is elected in the Eastern district, instead of Lyman. I made my visit last week to  Haverhill and found my Sister as well as I expected,  at times Low in Spirits. She desired me to make her gratefull acknowledgments to you for the aid afforded to her Son, Without that assistance she should not have ventured to have continued him at Colledge after the present year. I am assured that the overseers will grant him every aid in their power, so that he will not be any great expence to his Mother for his Education. Captain Brooks says that the Tennant cannot live in the Farm House at  Medford an other Year, that the House is now proped up with Timber and Stakes, and that they are in Danger every Storm. I talked with Mrs. Shaw. She would sell her part, if she could vest the property in any real estate equally productive, but she has referd herself wholy to Dr. Tufts to do for her as he would act for a Daughter of his own in the same circumstances. She says, if she Builds she must morgage the interest for a number of Years, which under her present circumstances, she knows not how to do without. May Dr. Tufts be collecting material this winter for Building? With regard to Home, the last week our people finishd the potatoes and carted manure, one day brought up three scow loads of  making 18 loads and would have got another, but Mrs. Pope took it into her Head that bringing off the sea weed, would leave the Farm exposed to be washed away with the sea, so our people lost a tide being obliged to remove to an other place to load. The westerly winds and high tides had carried it off from our own ground. Last Saturday and several days through the week we had severe weather, and considerable Snow. The sea has made round the Shoar so that at present no more sea weed can be got in that way. Savil and Nightingale have cleard the shore Line. The latter brought his account yesterday. 28  [illegible]  Load for which I payd him. Bracket and Savil have not yet brought theirs, We have got home our new Wheels, Splitting Hills and getting out the remainder of the Manure will be the next object. The Winter however approaches fast. Shaw suits me exactly. The 5 oclock hour does not find me in Bed. The Sun is just now rising and promising a fine day. Mrs. Brisler and Family are well and are to keep thanksgiving here tomorrow.  "

","My dearest Friend I received  ,  11th , 12, and  l4th . You are made easy respecting the election of Mr. Ames  I believe that many of the Electors would not bear a strict scrutiny any more than Jarvis's party. I fear that in one sense evil was done, that good might come of it. There was no other way of parrying the Stroke, but making use of similar weapons and as Hudibrass had it,  ""to Combat evil, tis Lawfull to employ the devil."" Where is Mr. Strong? If I did not see some good Mens Names amongst the absent I should suppose that it was concerted measure amongst the Antifeds to prevent Congress from proceeding to Business. They testify their  by their disinclination to attend. Tis said Burr, is Electioneering. I hope the next accounts will bring us News of a Senate and the Presidents Speach, which is impatiently looked for. Clinton I presume did not marry his daughter to Genett to obtain popularity. I should suppose it would be an injury to him. Mr. Cranch writes his Mother how highly he was gratified by his visit with you to the President. I am grieved for him. His loss in  is considerable, but his Books were of much more value and concequence to him. Mr. Daltons projects at his time of Life allways appeard wild to me. To be but the first in a village, is, preferable to the second in None and is one of the first maxims in the Catalogue of Ambition. This principal mean the Man's Palace, which in Splendor is to out shine the Bingham House, and the Gallery of pretty fashions will find employment for the Ladies. But not till the Two Young Ladies come forth as Models, for to be first, is the Charm. As your Friend is not endowd with the Means,  you have sometimes chargd her with the inclination of following a head, she can at least boast that she is contented with what is allotted her, and would rather aim at the Character given by Solomen by rising whilst it is yet Night, and giving meat to her House hold and a portion to her Maidens. The Business  since I wrote last, is that of casting 30 load of Manure upon the Hill, getting up some sea weed for Banking houses and finishing splitting Hills upon this place. Thanksgiving Day and a visit to  Abington by the two Shaws, has broken the week. 70 load of Sea Weed have been spread upon the clover and orchard. The Meddow shall be attended to if there is time after splitting Hills at the other place. I have not made any use of the order. The Time draws nigh when you can transmit me what I have occasion for. If Savil calls before I will borrow of the Dr. My  quarters will be up in December. Be so good as to tell Brisler to send me a couple of Baines flower. 9 Dollars is the price here. As to Rye flower, I will wait till Spring. It may fall but I question it. Not a Bushel of Rye has been at market for some weeks I am told by people who want, 7 Shillings pr Bushel  was the last price. Mr. Cranch says if you will subscribe for Fennos papers for him, as post Master, they shall come to me free of postage.    "

","My Dearest Friend I have to  the receipt of several Letters from you, together with Demauriers Memoirs; for which accept my thanks; I wish to hear from you, and to learn something of the Buisy World as often as your Time will permit, but in return I have only to relate to you the small occurrencies which my Family and Farm afford. Not a Son to visit me now, and enliven by his presence once a week or fortnight, a long Winter Evening, and to detail to me what is passing in the more active Scenes of Life. Mary is gone home, and Julias sportive Gambols are the enliveness of some solitary moments when unoccupied with the cares of my Family; and feeling anxious to hear from my Children. I have just finishd a Letter to each of them to go by Captain Scott. I hope you will write to them as I see several vessels up to go from  Philadelphia. The business of the week past, has been plowing, casting  and stones. Two of my Hands will leave me in the course of the present week as their time expires. They have been very usefull in going with the Scow for sea weed. The Weather now grows too Boisterous to make further use of it, this Season. I am in hopes if the Season permitts to compleat filling the Yards from the Shore, but I have made no provision for my fireside yet, but from day to day. I have been so desirious to improve all the open weather for the other business. Mr. Pratt has  Mr. Cranch that he means to sell his pew. He bid it of at 42 pounds. He laid out in finishing it between 4 & 5 pounds. He would sell it for 46. Mr. Cranch desird me to let you know it. He will not part with it till he hears from you. Dr. Tufts desires me to get Mr Brisler to inquire the price of clover Seed. The President  I hear is come. I have not seen it. The weather is was bad yesterday, and my Neighbours did not get their paper. Just as I was folding my letter, to close it,  yours of the 19   was brought me. I know our feelings are often in unison, and I fear you would think me in low spirits. My spirits tho some times low, from particular causes, are generally on a uniform key. I am sorry you are deprived of Mrs. Otis and Familys Society. I know it amused you. Three Months will soon slide away when I hope we shall meet again. I shall inclose the Presidents speech to our Son. Thanks for the Book.   "

","My Dearest Friend Your kind favours of the 19th ,  23  and  26 of Novbr.  came safe to Hand, together with the pamphlet, The writer appears to have  pandimonium, and collected into a small compass the iniquity and abuses of several generations,  ""Sitting down all in malice and naught  extermating."" If the representations of our democratic Societies both of men and measures, for these two years past, were to be collected into one pamphlet, and could obtain belief, some future Jefferson, might cry out, that it containd an astonishing concentration of abuses."" In a Government like that of  Great Britain, we know that many abuses exist, both in the Governors and governed, but still in no Country,  America excepted, has there ever existed so great a share of personal Liberty and Security of property. You ask what I think of  France. I ruminate upon them as I  a wake many hours before light. My present thought is, that their victorious Army will give them a Government in Time, in spight of all their conventions, but of what nature it will be, it is hard to say. Men warlike and immured to Arms and conquest, are not very apt to become the most quiet submissive Subjects. Are we, as reported, to have a new Minister from thence? I presume Munroe is to their taste. It will be well if he does not take a larger latitude than his credentials will warrant. I am anxious for our Dear Sons. These prospects are not very pleasent, even  the french should not get possession of  Holland. This Whirligig of a World, tis difficult to keep steady in it. It gives me pain to find you so lonesome in the midst of so many amusements. I know you do not take pleasure in them, but you would feel more  if you went more into Society. Your the knitting work and Needle are a great relief in these long winter Evenings which you, poor Gentleman cannot use. Like Mr. Solus in the play, you want a wife to hover about you, to bind up your temples, to mix your Books and to pour out your Coffe,"" but dont you know, that you will prize her the more for feeling the want of her for a time?

The News of the day is that Mrs. Hancock is going to take Captain Scot into her Employ, in plain Words that she is going to marry him. An able bodied enough sea Captain, ""Frailty thy Name is woman. We cannot call it Love; for at her age the hey-day in the Blood is tame, its humble And waits upon the Judgment, and what Judgment would step so low.""  Alas Dorethy I never thought the very wise, but I thought the proud and ambitious. Do you say I am censorious. It may be so, but I cannot but wonder. Adieu. Pray write in good Spirits.

","My Dearest Friend I was most sadly  last Evening when my Newpapers came from the post office without a Letter. The latest date I have received was Novbr. 20, so that two post have arrived without a line. I am not anxious if one, only paper, but you are usually so good in writing me once a week always; and very frequently oftener, that I am really allarmd least you are sick, and very sick otherways you would have written. My only hope rest now that Mr. Freeman who I hear got in yesterday, may have a letter for me. I shall be in the Vapours till Saturday, if I do not hear. I have read with great eagerness the Debates in Congress, and whilst I am highly gratified at the firmness and  Spirits discoverd by those who with Superior Tallents Support the Laws and Government, I am mortified to find so large a proportion of that House Abbettors of Jacobine Clubbs, and favourers of a Spirit of insurrection and Rebellion. Yet tis best that the world should see and know them, and their principals. These have been pritty fully displayd in the late Debates. Austin I hear is thundering his annathm annathamas against the President and Erving Giles in the the Chronical. We have had remarkable fine weather since December came in. I pray you to send me for a New Years Gift, Lady Cravens Journey to  Constantinople, Rennet's Strictures on Female Education, and to Louisa Bennets Letters to a young Lady. They are to be sold at Davies Book Store  68  Market Street. My Creditors call upon me, and I promise to pay them in the course of the Month. I am really in want of a remittance. I know I have it in my power to help myself, but I had rather wait a few Days long.  I have only time to add sincere and fervent wishes for your Health and happiness, without which neither can be the lot of your ever affectionate I have written to you every week.  "
"Quincy  December 12th 1794
","My Dearest Friend If I had waited patiently for the post of Thursday Noon, I need not have had so much anxiety, but I had sent on Wednesday to the office, and received my papers, and word that there were no Letters, so not having been very well myself, my Imagination conjured up that you were not only sick, but very sick, or you would not let two posts pass without writing. I was relieved by  your Letters of December 1   and 2d . What I wrote you respecting the  Medford Farm, and collecting Materials for Building, went only upon the Supposition that my Sister should sell. The Building I know will be expensive, but according to Captain Brooks the house is scarcely habitable. If I had more landed estate, which  been my Fathers, I should regret less the parting with my part of the  Medford Farm, for I never had an anxiety upon my mind but what if I was ever to be so unhappy as to need it, that I should be sufficiently provided for. Yet as that is my Birth Right; been upwards of ninety Years in the Family and sixty Tennanted by the same Name; I own I should part with it with great Reluctance. Captain Brooks told me that there had been a Number of persons to him, since the Death of Mr. Shaw to inquire if Mrs. Shaw would sell and whether it were possible to purchase the whole. The Annals have given a rise to land in that Neighbourhood. If Mrs. Shaw does not sell, she will Mortgage the income to Build. I have conversd with the Doctor upon the Subject. He means to go to  Medford and take a Carpenter with him and estimate the cost. Mrs. Shaw has some thoughts of selling Hockly which will enable her to Build without relinquishing her income from the place  Medford Farm, but she is still undetermind, and wishes for advise. I did not like to give it, first, because I really could not say which was best for her to do, and because I was an interested person, tho I know I am not selfish, and should dispise my self if I was capable of even wishing an advantage over any person, much less the widow of Fatherless. I was gratified the last week in hearing of an act of benevolence in the  Haverhill Farmers. Some of them proposed to the Gentlemen of the Town, that if they would purchase a quantity of wood in the woods sufficient for Mrs. Shaw this Winter, they would cut and draw it, which was accordingly done, and at Thanksgiving they continued and manifested their regard and affection towards her. Who ever goes after her in the Relation in which she has stood, will find a difficult Task to make her place good. No person could wish to be more loved and regarded by a people than she is with by them. Have you read the Jacobiniad in the Orrery? Do you know its features? You will recollect a request made for a  of a poem. The reply was that it was out of the hands of the owner. If they become sausy and Insolent it shall be printed, said they. Who the retailer is I know not. I suppose Honestus's attack upon the President has brought forth the extracts alluded to. I was pleasd with the add up of the Senate, and observd to Mr. Cranch how feelingly the President replied and with an ardour and warmth, that show his Sensibility upon the occasion. The add up of the House, is like the motion of a Caterpillar, slow and heavy; I expect the Countanance which the Democrats have met with from the House, and their unwillingness to censure them, will cost this Country a standing Army. As  France has had a great hand in raising the Spirit of amity and rebellion here, now she appears to be convinced of the pernicious concequences resulting from her Revolutionary Tribunals. Jacobine clubs &c. &c. since the convention have declared it a disgrace to suffer any voices to be heard in the Republick, which shall speak louder than the National representatives, I hope their influence will be as great in crushing this Hydren,as in giving birth to it, but the Devil is always easier raisd than laid. What say the Jacobins to that part of the addups which say,  ""No private Authority, or Society is the People; or ought to act or speak in their Name.""  Holland it is generally believed is in the Hands of the French.  England is just ready for Tumult, happy  America, Land peculiarly blest: Long may it continue thus, under an all gracious Providence, To whom do this people owe their Safety and Security? To their wise Governours, their judicious patriots, and to the enlightned

part of the community. Present my  compliments to Mr. Ceracchi for his obliging present. If it is as good a likeness as the Bust, I shall value it highly. I wish I could obtain a Medallion of the President as a Companion to it. This Country will never again be blest, as it is at this period. May the Remembrance be perpetuated. I see the Secretary of the Treasury has sent in his determination to resign, Have his adversaries hunted him down? Or has he more aspiring views? Where will be found a successor? The Farmers Calender must succeed. This week 3 Days have been  in the Woods, one day in plowing for Mr. Belcher. Diging up the wall and heaping the Stones for sleding has occupied some of their time. To day they are in quest of more Sea Weed, but my people, all report, that they have cleard the Shores of it. The manure at the Barn will be attended to. At present we see no prospect of Snow, nor does the Season look like winter. Shaw told me a few days ago that he had been Seven weeks here, and that his Team had not stood still a day during the whole time, Sundays excepted. His Namesake wants more energy. Tis difficult getting him in motion. Mrs. Brisler is here . She and her Family are well. Our Friends are all So. Your Mother has walked here twice this week, and spent two days more days with me. Remember me to Mrs. Otis and Cousin Betsy. They were all well at her Brothers yesterday.  "

","My Dearest Friend Tomorrow will  three Months since our dear sons saild, and this moment I have received a Letter from Town with this agreable intellegence, ""on Sunday Evening the 14 Captain Joy arrived from  England. Just before he saild from the downs, a ship came too about 2 miles a head, of him. The Pilot who came on Board Captain Joy told him she was the Ship Alfred in 32 days from  Boston. Tho I have no letters; yet to know that the vessel is safe arrived, has given me a pleasure which you will easily conceive and participate, and I seazd my pen instantly to communicate it to you. I pray God our dear Children may be safe and well. I expect Letters from you tomorrow. Mr. Brislers Letter came to day inclosing a Bill of .

","My Dearest Friend I received  your kind favour of the 5th ,  7th ,  8th  and  10th . What you mention with respect to the Sale of the Farms in the , may be true for ought I know. Mr. Black is really in earnest to dispose of his. A Gentleman was up last week to look at it, but thought the price too high. As to the other, I am sure he is not happy here. He has not sufficient Farm to occupy his time here, and as soon as he has compleated all his Buildings he will be still more miserable. He has no resource within himself. 4 or 5 Sons to Educate, or put into Business, it would not be surprizing to me if he should sell provided a purchaser appeard. Commerce flourishes so surprizingly, not with standing the  ""depredations of unreasonable despoilers"" that I presume these Gentlemen are solicitious to put their property to a better use, than delving in the Earth, merely to get a daily Sustanance. I should however be sorry to have them leave the Neighbourhood, as they are good Neighbours. You inquire after Mr. Wibird. He vegetates, without courage, without Spirit, without Resolution. He visits his old Friends , but has not been out to meeting once. Mr. Briggs continues to preach. By his means I have had the pleasure of hearing Mr. Harris and Mr. Ware. In short we shall be so nice soon, that we shall be willing that Mr. Wibird may go and sleep with his Ancestors. I went to see Uncle Quincy the other day. He was as well as usual. Our Clergy many of them attackd the self created Clubbs in their Thanksgiving Sermons, before the President and Senate, denounced them, Mr. Ware of  Hingham, Mr. Gardner of  Boston, and Mr. Osgood of  Medford whose Sermon was printed. I have been so much pleasd with the perusal of it, that I have sent to purchase a couple, and in the mean time have taken Brother Cranchs to forward to you. Mr. Ames has not spoken with more force or Energy, than Mr. Osgood has preachd against these Anarchists. Mr. Osgood has taken particular notice of the Governour's Proclamation for Thanksgiving, and given him a well merritted repremand, for his total neglect of the National Government, and ascribed it I believe to the true Source. Mr. Cranch desires me to thank you for your kind attention to his Son. I hope some arrival will soon bring us good News from ours. We see so little Way before us, that I think it best to submit all futurity into the hands of the great Disposer of Events, who has directed us not to be anxious over much.  ""To enjoy is to obey."" I will therefore with gratitude reflect upon the large portion of comfort and happiness which has fallen to my lot, without repining at that which is  me. Eames is arrived. Tomorrow I shall send for my flower and Seed. I am obliged to make use of the credit left me. I did not know that an Appropriation was necessary till March, and I had engaged to discharge some  accounts to my Tennants to the Sea Weed casters, Black Smiths &c. the middle of the Month, so that for a week past I have been affraid to hear a rap at the Door least it should be a dun. Remember me to Mrs. Washington most . I respect and love that good Lady. You have never said a word about and his Lady. I presume you have exchangd visits. I have been reading Mores 2d  Journal, and what surprizes me is, that when Robert Spears Character was so justly appreciated and his views suspected, that he was able to gain such an assendency, and to rule so despotically for two years after the Death of the King. A Man who appeard so unpopular as he was in the convention - it must have been owing to the assendency of the Jacobines and the Mountain. The spirit of Faction has received a wound. Happy would it be for  America if it was a Fatal one. The Presidents frown, the Senates supporting him and, the Spirit of the people in marching against the insurgents all has conspired to  stiffle the Flame. Even the Chronical can barely find fuel.  "
"Quincy  December 26 1794
"," My Dearest Friend I fear you will think me tardy in not acknowledging sooner the Receipt of  your Letter of the 11th  with the order upon the Bank for 600 Dollars, but  I sent to the post office and wrote to Mr. Hastings, I was told that the post had brought no Letters for me. Since the establishment of a post office in  Quincy the Letters are sorted and put up for each office, so that a Letter coming in of a Wednesday I cannot get till thursday Noon, which makes it impossible for me to reply or answer till the next Mondays post which is the reason you some times miss of a Letter when you expect one, for be assured however barren my letters are, nothing short of a sickness confineing me to my Bed and the loss of my Hands will prevent me writing once a week to you; the Letter you mention brought by the Presidents Servant, must as sometimes used to happen have been by mistake taken for the President. I enjoy at present as much Health as usual; having done pennance for a Month, I did not however suffer so severely as in times past. I was first  upon my Lungs with a Hoarsness, a cough, and fever followd; all my complaints tend are of an inflamitory kind. I got better, and went below stairs, was attackd with the intermitting and confind a fortnight longer. But I did not omit writing you: tho I would not make you uneasy by letting you know that I was sick. I think I feel better now than I have done through the fall or winter, and have been less troubled with the pain in my Head. I do not like to hear you complain so much of Lowness of spirits. A Cheerfull Heart doth good like a medicine. Zimerman may prate about the blessings of solitude, but Man was not made to be alone; I must say to you, as Lord Lyttleton wrote to his Father,  ""Suffer not a depression of spirits to rob you of that pleasing hope which both supports and nourishes. Think less of those circumstances which disquiet you,"" and rejoice in those which ought to gladden you. Consider the Reputation you have acquired, the Glorious Reputation of integrity. Imagine that your Posterity will look upon it, as the Noblest fortune you can leave them, and that your Childrens, Children will be incited to virtue by your example. Here I will transcribe the overflowiness of a gratefull Heart from a letter this Moment received.  ""When did you hear from my dear Brother Adams. Patron of his Country and Friend of the Fatherless. How was his great Soul moved, tenderly sympathizing with his poor Bereaved Sister, his compassionate looks made an indeliable impression upon my mind. Pilgrimages are out of date, or I could go Barefoot to Mecca, or any where else, to honour him. He did not satisfy himself with ineffectual wishes, of."" Be ye warned, and be ye cloathed but has kindly relieved my mind by assisting me with means to educate William. When I reflect upon this instance of his pity and Generosity and of the kindness of my other Friends, I cannot find words

to express the gratefull Sense I have of their favours."" Your Letters of December the 14th   and 16  came by the post of the 24th together with the Book and pamphlet, but I have not received a  since the 8 of December. I know not the reason. If Congress have so little business upon their Hands, I hope they will do it in Season and do it well. Is there no pleasure but in troubled waters? Mr. Osgoods Sermon has run through two Editions, and the printer says he never had such a demand for a sermon in his Life. The Chronical writers attack it, but Mr. Osgood will not notice any one who does not sign their real Name. I am was mistaken in my Idea respecting the Poem called the Jacobiniade. It is upon the same plan, but not half so keen as severe. The second Number convinced me of my mistake. I shall purchase the pew. I had not taken any money of  Lincoln. I was to have it on Saturday, but I have informd him that I have no occasion for it. I am sorry to say that I shall be obliged to purchase Hay for the Horses. The Calendar of the week past may be comprizd in casting sea weed and spreading it. I have had the peice of ground next Mr. Bass oposite your Mothers coverd this week, but tis slow work to cast it so far as the other place and two loads is the most which they can accomplish tho the weather is the finest I ever knew in December. Our people are constantly employd. I will say to you in my next something respecting the Medallion. When you wrote me of a medallion in marble, I thought it had been of the size of a Crown peice such as I have seen abroad. I long to hear from our dear Children but my Heart was several pounds lighter when I heard the vessel was safe arrived. The Baron I see by the papers is no more. Charles has lost a valuable Friend, and will be a sincere Mourner for him. Mr. Cranch desires me to thank  for your kind attention to his Son. Our Friends are all well. Your Mother is as well as I have known her for several winters. My Love to Mrs. Otis, and cousin Betsy. I think often of Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Otis and hope to have agreable tydings from each of them. Mr. and Mrs. Storer, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, the Dr and Mrs. Welch and old Aunt Edwards made up a party the day before Christmass and  with me. Aunt Edwards says she shall not forget the May day in December the middle of the next Century. The Rose Bush under the window is leaving out, the bunches of clover are quite as lively as May and the Grass is changed. Adieu.

","My Dearest Friend I received by our Thursday post, yours of Decbr. 18 and 23 together with the Bennets Strictures. You may be sure Bennet is a favorite writer with me for two reasons. The first is; that he is ingenious enough, to  and point out the more than Egyptian Bondage, to which the Female Sex, have been subjugated, from the earliest ages, and in the second place; that he has added his Mite, to the cultivation, and improvement of the Female Mind. Much yet remains to be done. There is however more attention paid to the Education of Females in  America, within these last 15 years than for a whole centry before, and the rising Generation will be benifitted by it. Conjugal fidelity holds the first place in the Rank of Female Virtues, and whilst that Source is uncorrupted, we may hope to see the united efforts of parents exerted towards the improvement and cultivation of the minds and morals of their ospring regardless of the Sex, affording to each an Education to qualify them to move with honour and dignity in their proper Sphere. You promised me an account of the Female Commencement, Was you , either in your expectations or in your attendance? I wrote you not long since a request that you would subscribe for Fennos paper for Mr. Cranch as Post Master. Since that I have not received a paper from Fenno, nor has Mr. Cranch received one as Post Master. I do not know  how the Act stands, or whether you are subject to postage for a News paper. As post Master Cranch is entitled to the News paper post free: it would come regularly to him. He would have the reading of it, and I too. I lose the greater part of the debates by not seeing Fennos paper. A small proportion only is retailed to us in our  Boston papers. How insolent and impudent are the Jacobines of  ? They have adopted the very stile and language of the French Jacobines, and they breath the Sentiments of the Southern incendaries in Congress. Judge Lowel asked Mr. Bowdoin how in his conscience he could vote for Jarvis? Why he replied I do not like his politicks, and I despise the Man, but I have been neglected and slighted by the other Party: Such is the Patriotism of the World. How little sterling integrity: How hard the lesson to divest one of self interest. The World however see through the veil, and it is oweing to this same Self Love, that the Man has been neglected. Neither his Fathers Patronage, nor his own ample fortune have been able to raise him higher than State Senator. And there with such principals may he remain. Winter has sit in with Vigor, a flight of Snow succeeded by cold, an inclement week. We have not much to relate in the Way of Business. Getting Wood, and some attentions at home, have occupied our people this week. We want Snow. To Day we have a heavy Rain  with slight Snow. The Broad Wheels are under Water. The Scow  is laid up for the winter; the cable brought home; not so much Sea Weed, in Joys Yard as I could wish. Nor Shaws. The reason is that  Quincy Meddow is coverd, 8 load upon a small Spot next Mr. Bass and the Scarcity of the Article. Our Teams have been as far as  Horse Neck after it. If the Weather permits every opportunity will still be embraced. The persons you bird carted as long as they could find their account in it, and I have paid them 40 Dollars wanting a few Shillings. 40 odd for the cast Wheels and repairing the others. The pew I have a deed of, and have paid 46 pounds. I have paid to my Men and Women Tennants their 3d quarter, and, a number of small matters; I have paid up Copland. The Time for which I engaged him expires on Monday. He tells me that his Family must want if he cannot get employ through the Winter, that he has 5 children, but one of which is old enough to put nut and she so weakly as to be unfit. There are only two Months before we must necessarily have an additional Hand on account of the canker worm and other things. I have offerd to hire him for the Year from the first of Janry. I believe he will stay. I tell them they must bring a great deal of work to pass. Sea Weed they say makes but little Show, and Wood burns up. Shaw is a very excellent hand. He has hurt himself and for a fortnight has been unable to do much stooping under the cart to do something to an . The cart tipd up upon the Small of his back, brought him to the Ground, and set him to spitting Blood.

","My dearest Friend Yours of 25 december  me with the Book for Louissa. Through the Month of december the Weather was uncommonly fine, but the New Year is very inclement. We have had a fair day or two only since it commenced, very little Snow and what snow we had, is all leaving us to day, by a plentifull southerly rain. Our people have been engaged where the Weather would allow this week in the woods. I have had my wood cut by them this Winter in what is calld  Beals Lot. They go to the Top of the Hill cut if, and pitch it down. The Weather has been moderate and if we had snow this could not be done as the Hill is high rocky and steep, nor would any persons do this, if hired to cut by the cord. I am soliticious to get sufficient for the winter and summer. I shall be only second in command by and by. Yet I think I am more solicitious to have the commands of my Principal executed in his absence, than when he is present. If you see the Chronical you may read the address of our   self created Society. It is much more respectfull and Modest than the  Pennsilvania address, and is not badly pennd. I presume Morten was the draughtsman. It is however false, and artfull. I read it last Evening in my Neighbour Beats paper. They are all Galld that the President denounced them, but let any person attend to the horrid scenes produced in  France by the unlawfull combinations of the worst and most profligate part of society, and say if the a similar spirit does not excite and actuate the Jacobins of  America to insurgency  and rebellion.

","My Dearest Friend By our  Quincy post I received yours 28th and 30th of December. I am sorry to find you had taken a cold. Let Brisler make you a Bowl of wine whey when you go to bed, for one or two Nights, and you will find yourself released.  the Weather has been so very fine and spring like, our cattle never have been sharpend till this week. Yet I cannot but keep in mind that it is mid winter, that Grain would not grow if it was planted. My Farmers are some Weeks?, confined to one point object, and then there is little to be related. The providing fuel for a Family for the Year whose summer consumption is so great, is no small Business, and tho I have the use of two Teams Ezara Shaw very seldom can go more than Once a Day with his, having a large Stock to attend to night and morning, and not having the greatest force within himself. Joy tho not so large a Stock has the same care. I consulted your Brother respecting the Lot from which I had best procure my wood, and he advised me to the mountain which you bought of captain Beal, the wood there being old, and requiring several hands to pitch and role it down Hill. As neither Sled or cart could assend it, I have taken into consideration that the Winter is the only proper time to get the Wood, and that I ought to have so much as not to be obliged to seek for it in the Summer or fall when other Business require all the Hands, and that you will  be at home much earlier in the Spring when you will occupy your Hands and Teams in other Business. The Moment however that Snow comes, the woods will be left to draw Stones. The Ground has not through the Winter been so frozen as to cart the Stones from the common which are heapd for the purpose or to sled the manure from Joys Barn. I rejoice with Mrs. Otis in her safety. My Love to her. I wish I could hear the same good News from . A Man of Galantry should never think a journey tedious which carries him to his Home. Genll. may flatter him self that he will become rich if he retires, but He will find the old Proverb true, that he must ask his Wifes leave. ""With her tastes and habits,"" Green , and purling streams, and Lakes and Nightingales, would be odious things. She cannot till the Sun has reachd his mid Day Career. The Wife of a Farmer must look well to the Ways of her Household, and neither eat the Bread of Idleness herself, or permit others too. I do not know any Lady less calculated for Retirement, contentment must always derive its Scource from the Heart. Luxery, ambition and avarice know no bounds, and desire is a fathomless abyss. Mrs Morris reads Zimmermann upon Solitude, and builds a palace in a City. The President from the bottom of my Heart I commisirate. I consider him the Great sacrifice for the Good of the People, and I feel my Share of gratitude towards him, but his Reward as well as all others who have been placed upon the high Towers, and the Battlements, and have stood firm  and unshaken at their Posts, are to be received in a state more congenial to their virtues, even with the Spirits of Just Men made perfect. The conduct of the democratic Society in  Boston and their Sentiments  in their address to the Societies throughout the union, is exactly as far as circumstances will admit, like the Jacobins in  France toward the convention. See the French account publishd in the Centinal of Janry. 7th. ""After the fall of Robertspierre, their Meetings ceased for several days. At last they come together and and felicitate the convention upon the fortunate discovery of the conspiracy, and Fate of the Traitors and declare themselves devoted to the Principals of the Revolution."" Thus the  Society declare their attachment to the Government, their abhorrence to any acts of violence against the law, which they say can scarcly be justified under any Circumstances. The Society are opposed to every out rage of this nature, not only from Principal, but from policy, for it is impossible that any System of social improvement can be embraced, either as to the Government or its administration, amidst that tumult of passions, which such commotions have a direct tendency to produce. ""But the Whole of the address is full of the Hypocritial cant, and the fangs of the Tiger appear, ready to seize upon the first lucky minuit and the only Modesty they make a spew of, arises from the Suppression of the late Rebelion, and the State of Poetics in  France."" I quit them for a  much more agreeable,  that of assuring You of the Sincere and Affection Regard of Your    "

I see by the papers the judicious Notion of Giles as It is an other Bone to pick; and brought forward with no other view or design, but to render himself popular with the Sans Culotts. I cannot help despiseing and abhoring a Man, who is governd by such base and sordid Motives. Giles face was allways my aversion and his Heart I detest, for I believe it desperately wicked. I think however that every precaution should be taken to prevent Foreigners from gaining too great an assendency in our Country, or taking any Share in our Government. A Long period of time they ought to be upon probation, and after all the precautions we can devise they will be too numerous and powerfull for us if the troubles abroad continue, and increase. I hope  Amsterdam will not be obliged to surrender to the Arms of  France, for altho I do not feel towards them, as I did whilst that worse than Borgia, Governd, Yet I am far from thinking they have returnd sufficiently to their reason to Govern themselves, or dictate any thing good to others.

It is neither Sense or Grammer, I have heard two Characteristic Marks of Sullivans performance's, but I rather think him too cunning to wage War against so popular a performance, especially for a Man, who I am informd drinks daily the Health of the President and Vice President at his table, and who has never dard openly to meet with, or give  his Sanction to the Jacobines. There is much conjecture who the writer of the Jacobiniad is. He is certainly a Man of Letters, and a Poet. Master Cleverly is in great distress that the President, being a Church Man, should appoint a Thanksgiving during Lent. He shakes his Head, and says  a very Arbitary thing. I suppose he cannot help connecting plumb pudding, Roast Turkey and Minced Pye. He cannot give thanks upon Eggs and fish. It will always be thanksgiving Day to me, come at what time you will. It would be doubly so could I hear from our Sons. When you return I believe you must spend a day or two with . She seems to be hurt that you pass on so rapidly and do not afford her a little more Time. She feels as if it was a want of affection in her parents, or of a proper Respect and Duty towards them from her and that the World will thus construe it. I know your anxiety to get home, and I know all your Reasons. But at the same time I know you would not hurt or wound a deserving and affectionate Child. I have received a Bill of Laiding from Mr. Brisler which I shall  to Mr Smith who has been very sick, with an inflamitory Rehumatism. You will have received my Letter respecting , and some other things which I wrote to Mr Brisler about. He may get me a couple of hundred of Rye flower if you please. I give 8 Shillings for Rye here, and I cannot get Hay, as yet at a less Price than 5 and 9 pence per hundred and grain is so high. The Democrats  [illegible]   have no  need to exclaim against the Salleries. I am sure they are pretty effectually lower 'd. Grain is twice as high as it was when they were Granted; so are all the necessaries of Life, but there is no end of their mad and absurd plots. I had it in mind whether the canker worm would not go up, but I supposed instinct would teach them that they could not find nourishment. The weather is not quite Winter, cold  the Ground is not coverd yet being icy and a little Snow. One Team has been employd in sleding the manure across the Meddow from Joys. I presume they will compleat it to day. The other in getting the Stones from the common and this at a time when they could go in the Woods to good purpose, but I would not neglect the only opportunity we have had this Winter for this Business. Present me most dutifully to the . They are both too good to be persecuted. Yet blessed are  [illegible]  they says a high Authority when Men Revile and Speak evil falsly, of them. Louis  me to present her duty to you and many thanks for your kind Present. I am very anxious for her. Her Health declines and she is pale as death, yet makes no complaint, but weakness. I know you will say it is want of exercise which has brought her to it. I should think so more, if each of her Sisters had not past through a similar Weakness and debility. Hers has been increasd by returns of the Ague.  "
"Quincy  Janry. 21 1795
","My Dearest Friend We have had very severe weather through the whole of this Week, but very little Snow. Yet the Ground being hard froze, our people have been sledging Stones. To day the Wind has come round to the Southard, and Thaws. We can not do half the business I want to have done. From here they go out early and spend no Idle time. The other Team does not work so hard, but looking after so Many cattle takes up much time. You will see by the papers The  Speach. He has paid more attention to publick affairs than in any former Speach. Mr. Osgood has really awakened him to a Sense of his Duty. His Speach however is a pretty cold one and shows that he was constraind to say something, or look very imfeaderal. The  Connecticut News Boy is really cruel to the old Gentleman. I hope it will not be a Death Wound, as a similar insinuation from Burke killed Good Dr. Price. He has given a Sprig of Laurel to embelish (I am too much of a Democrat) to say brown a Friend of mine. I think Congress had better have passd to the order of the Day than have squabled so long to have made so much ill Blood, merely to give the Jacobines a Triumph. It was knowing the Motives of the Mover that  the indignation of the opposers. It was a Trap to catch those who scornd the Bate. It was done to allarm the credulous, and wound the feelings of those who possessd too much independance of Spirit to flinch at the trial. Having carried their point, I am sorry there was so much opposition to the Yeas and Nays. You will see by the papers that our Sons had a fine passage. I am told that some private Letter informs that they left  London on the 30 of October, for the Hague. I have written twice by way of  London. Tis strange that we get no Letters. Are there none from ? I hope it will not be long before I shall hear from them. Perilious are the Times into which they have fallen. I hope it may prove for their good and the benifit of their Country that they are called into Service in so critical a period. Many are my reflections upon it.in the wakefull Watches of the Night, to an overruling Providence I commend them.  "
"Quincy  Janry. 1795 [[post 28] January 1795]
","My Dearest Friend I yesterday received your several Letters  those from Thomas. I do most sincerely rejoice in their Safety and Welfare of our sons. I hope I am not unmindfull of the repeated favours of Providence towards my Family, in protecting and preserving them both by Sea and Land. May the same gracious Providence continue to Guard them, and to make them usefull in the various Stations in which they may be called to act. I had heard by a vessel which arrived at  Marblehead, that there was a Letter from Mr. Dickinson, mentioning that  dinned with him on some day in October. The captain says he read in a Gazzet, the Treaty between  Great Britain, and  America signd sometime in Novbr. but by some accident he came a way without the papers. If so important a matter is expected to come before Congress daily, I cannot urge you against your Duty. I understand that this Captain reports, that a vessel saild several days before him with dispatches from Mr. Jay. You will see that the News Boy did not escape a comment from me.Honestus's Father meeting Mr. Storer in the Street,  him and asked him, if he had seen the Centinal of the Day, to which he replied Yes, well have you read that infamous poetry, that Libel upon the Govenour: Yes. Well is not shamefull that our Printers should publish such rascally scandelous stuff.  Russel coppied it from the  Hartford paper. No matter replies the old Man. He ought to be punished for printing such a vile thing. Pray Mr. Austin have not other printers taken greater Latitude? Upon which the old Gentleman walkd off. Such measure as they meet to others they cannot bear to have measured to them. Jarvis rules the House of Representitives. Mr. Dexters Friends have not exerted themselves as they ought. Varnum is said to be a shallow Man, a great The Antis have exerted themselves for him, merely to revenge themselves for Mr. Ames Election. The third trial, there will be more exertion on both sides. We last night had a very  southerly Rain which carried of all the Ice and what little Snow there was, but we have not had it upon a level, on a inch deep. When ever our people could sled Stones, they have applied themselves to those in the common and have only got down the first wall. It employ Joy and Shaw more than a Week to sled down the manure from Joys place. He had 8 load of summer manure. We shall be very dilligent, or rather as much so as I can prevail upon them to be. Elisha Shaw want no stimulous. He is all Mrs. Hobart described him. Mr. White her Father died this week very suddenly. He mounted his Horse and road a few steps and fell of Dead. I have purchased three Tons of Hay. Captain Baxter from  the Neck brought me a Tax Bill of a Hundrd and 50 Dollars for the last Year. I told him I could not pay it till March. He was very  to have a part of it to prevent an execution being leveld by the State treasurer against him; so I told him I would pay him your proportion of the Hale tax.   Remember me kindly to all Inquiring Friends, and be assured of the sincere affection of your  .   "

","My Dearest Friend  On  I received a Letter from Col Smith informing me of the Birth of a Grandaughter. This You may be sure was much more agreable to me than to have heard of an other Boy. Mrs Smith is finely too, he writes me. This is an additional Blessing to hear of the Safety of our Dear Children abroad, and to receive the news of our Daughters being well abed and with a Daughter, has given such a Spring to my Spirits, that if your return was a Month later I would meet you at  New York. The climate is reversed. You have all the Snow and Winter with you. Our people have not been able to go once this Winter with a Sled into the Woods, and but for some Ice they could not have  a single Stone. The Harbour has been open the whole Season. The Rivers froze for about ten days. We have frequent and abundent southerly Rains. I hope you will not have so dissagreable a Time Home as you apprehend, tho March ishas frequently bad Roads. We have as usual a derth of News. No arrival from abroad, and as to Domestics occurrences I go so little from Home, that I know very little of them. Our Friends here are well as usual. Till within this fortnight it has been remarkably  in Town. Our Neighbour Mr. Blacks Family are very sick. A Cousin of Mr. Blacks is very Bad with the fever and Ague which he took in  N York State a Year ago. Jimmy and the other Man are sick with a Lung fever. I believe Mr. Blacks Cannel and the Situation of House, are not Healthy. Your Mother  has past through this Winter very comfortably. She has not misst a single Week through the Winter spending a Day with me. I expect her to day as I have sent the chaise for her. Since I began this Letter a vessel has arrived this Day. The News from England I have not yet  only that  Amsterdam was not taken. The 13 december I have a Letter from Mrs. Copley dated 15 Novbr. Many vessels  for  N York and  Boston about the same time. I think we may look for News of importance daily.  France must dread a General Peace. What will such a Nation do with such Armies and no Government? It sees to be the Age of Political Wonders.  I hope a few weeks more will return you in Health and Safety to your ever affectionate   "
"Quincy 8 February 1795
","My dearest Friend Mr. Thomas Welch came up this Evening and brought me Letters from our Sons' dated the 13 December from  the Hague. I presume Letters are gone on to Philadelphia to you, and Dispatches to the Secretary of State, but least you should not have any by this vessel, the most important intellegence which Mr. JQAs letter contains is that there is no prospect of Peace at Present tho at  Paris the Moderate Party Mantain their assendency. Yet he considers Moderation like all other Principals in that Country for 5 Years past, a Watch Word of a Faction, used to oppress an other faction, whose Watch word was Terror. He adds that he should not be surprizd to see the Jacobins restored in the course of six Months to all the Plenitude of their Power and Glory. (I hope to Heaven for the Sake of Humanity, that, that will never be.) In England he says the People are for Peace, the Administration for War. In Holland all the Provinces have recommended Negotiations for Peace. The Government Party pretend that they are going forward. The Patriots think that the French will not not  that but with them, and they most devoutly hope that the first article of the pacification may prescribe the extirpation of the present ruling power. He supposes  Treaty is before the Senate; long ere His Letter reaches me, wishes his Friends to write to him by way of  England as often as opportunity offers. Says tho he has not received any Letters that he had news from  America as late as November. Thomas Letter is chiefly taken up in discussing the Dutch Character and their predominate passion which will not even permit them to sacrifice a part of their property to secure the remainder. He finds himself embarressed by not speaking the French. Tho he understands a conversation, he can not hold one, is delighted with the  Hague, receives Civility and politeness from Your old Friends there, but feel rather a State of Enuie, and What all of us have felt, but few can describe. I should pitty either of them more were they there singly. Mr. Welch informs me that there is a vessel in  from  England with the papers to 5 Janry. The Kings speach, which Breaths nothing but War. He Mentions the Treaty concluded on between  G. Britain and  America. In  France there has been an attempt by the Jacobines to Awe the convention, and to prevent the trial and Execution of one of the Nanty Murderers. The People broke in to the Hall of the Jacobines, drove them all out an locked up their Hall. This is only a verbal recount from Mr. Welch. I presume the papers of tomorrow will carry the accounts on to you more accurate. I see  Humphries is returnd upon business of importance tis said. My compliments to him.   "
"Quincy  13 Febry. 1795
","My Dearest Friend It is peculiarly unfortunate that the Treaty has not yet   America. On the 19 November it was sign'd, and the vessel which brings the King of Englands Speach left London 5 Janry. In that he announces the conclusion of a Treaty with  America, and that the States General of the united Provinces were carrying on negotiation with  France for Peace. I believe he will find however disagreeable that his ministers must enter into negotiations with the ruling powers or have the whole Force of  France leveld against his Kindom. I  our Sons Letters to you.  [ . . . ]  have done it before, but I thought as JQA mentiond publick  [ . . . ]  by this vessel from  Rotterdam, that it was likly he had written to you, and then I wishd to keep them to answer them by a vessel going to  Hamburg which I have done. Just as you are about to rise a flood of Business will pour in upon you. Col. Humphries's arrival portends some matters of concequence. I should have been exceeding happy to have had you here at the time , but think your reason just, and judicious for remaining at a Time of such expectation. As you will not be here, I shall go to Town and accept one or other of the pressing invitations I have received from thence to keep thanksgiving there. You cannot but remark that each of our Thoughts run in the same channel. In many instances we have been expressing the same Sentiments at the same time.  may be calld the Tellegraph of the Mind. If it were not  for the altercation which the Jacobin clubs occasion, we should have an unruffld scene throughout the  United States. All our Country growing Rich, except the publick Drudges, and the Ministers of the Gospel. I have so little interesting to communicate to you in my Letters that your anxiety to receive them, can arise from no other  than a desire to know weekly that I am not sick. Even the canker worm and Caterpillar do not yet furnish a Subject. I believe our present Tennants mean to remain an other Year. I have directed them to cut and cart to each House two cords of pine Wood which they have nearly compleated. That with the Brush they may get will supply them for the Dairy Business.  meets with difficulty in procuring the Stuff, as the Swamps have not been sufficiently frozen to get it out. There is a vessel now going to Philadelphia, the Abbe Captain Davis, by which Mr. Brisler may ship such things as I wrote for. I Yesterday received yours 29 , Febry. 1 and 2 together with Mr. Jays Letter. The contents are agreable. The Weather here is mild, the Ground Bare.  has been a cloudy Month ever since it came in. My Love to Mrs. Otis, cousin Betsy &c. and my Respects to Mrs. Washington.   "
"Boston  Febry 21 1795
","My dearest Friend I did not get my thursday Letters  fryday Eve when as you may well suppose I was greatly allarmed at the account you gave me of our dear daughter. I had written twice too her since her confinement, but had not received a line tho, I requested Miss Peggy to write me whilst Mrs. Smith was unable. I suppose the fear of allarming was the reason, and as it is ten days since the date of yours and the Saturday post of this day brings me no letters I would fain hope that Mrs. Smith is on the recovery. I shall write however write by the Monday post requesting an immediate answer. Dr. Tufts  upon me yesterday informing me that He came to Town in concequence of a Letter of Mr. Brights to him giving him the offer of his Farm, that he had been to converse with him upon the Subject, that his Lowest Price was Seven Hundred and fifty pounds, to be paid down immediatly as he had in view making a purchase of an other Farm at a greater distance from Town. Half the Stock is included which is one Yoke oxen, one  [illegible]   horse, 4 cows 2 of them Brights. The oxen and horse are at the halfs. The whole amount of the Land is 100 Acers. 10 of salt Marsh 4 at the Farms good, six at the Neck poor. 10 Acres wood Land chiefly cut of. 8 acres pasture, 23 Mowing and Tillage, 49 fresh Meddow and pasture. The price and Terms prevented the Dr. from  giving him any answer, untill he recived orders from you. I have detaild facts. Our Tennants upon the two places I hear from others, not from themselves think their Terms must be increased on account of the great price of the necessaries, particularly Grain and meat. I feel anxious that the Treaty should arrive before the rising of Congress, but I begin to despair. The fire will in some measure be spent,  if it was a Treaty from Heaven pronouncing Peace on Earth and good will to Man, there would not be wanting a sufficient Number of deamons to Nash their teeth and send it to peices if they can. Mr. Jays mission was an unpleasent one and I fear he will be a sufferer for a while for the good he has done, and the Service he has renderd. Parson Thacher in his Sermon on thanksgiving day compared the French Revolution to a volcano, which had not only overturnd the Government of that Kingdom ravaging and destroying every thing near to its crater but by the voilence of its Eruption shaking all the Kingdoms arround, and the Lava of which came near to scorching even the  United States of America. He deliverd a very bold animated discourse for him. [illegible]   Many people from Town went to hear Mr. Osgood. His text was in psalms. ""He hath not dealt so with any Nation."" I am informd he took every part of the proclamation and commented upon it, and was not more mild with the Jacobins than before. To whomthem he asscribed and charged the late debt contracted in defence of the Laws. The Clergy in General exerted themselves as I am informd, with a true sense of Liberty and in support of the Government. There have been some exceptions taken. I find that the President did not mention Gospel priviledges, and call upon all denominations of Christians, One clergyman at a distance wrote to Mr. Osgood to inquire if he really thought the President was a Christian? The strict Church men here were hurt at thanksgiving being appointed upon their strict fasts. This they would not have regarded, if he had been a dissenter but as a Church man they could not reconcile it. I am sure the President did not mean to hurt the weak Brethren of any denomination. All Friends here desire to be rememberd to you. I know not whether I shall write again to you as it may not reach you. If I do I will direct it to  N York to the care of Col. Smith.  I am my dearest Friend most affectionatly Yours P S I am going to take Tea with Mrs. Hancock this afternoon by her particular invitation. On Monday I return to  Quincy.  "

I wish and hope that there may be no unnecessary cavils respecting the Treaty. Mr. Beauman came here last . Said he met You at  Prince Town on thursday. Told us Mr. Franchett was going to present a Memorial againt the Treaty. Perhaps Adets arrival may prove a fortunate circumstance. Mr. Jays Election seems to give great satisfaction here. I received a Letter Yesterday from Lousa Louisa of June 11th. She says the news of Mr. Jays arrival was received in  Boston with General Joy, desires me to tell her uncle that every thing respecting the Farm went on with great Harmony and allacrity and that it would do his Heart good to see his Farm. She tarried a Week after we left home. Mrs. Smith send duty to You. Poor little John has got the Ague and fever to a great degree. I am at present much better in my Health for my Journey. I avoid the Evening air, and take Baths  and drink porter and water as an Antidote to the Ague. The weather is very Warm here, but I hope we shall not be detaind here longer than the present week.

","My Dearest Friend I have regularly received Your Letters and thank you for them. I have read the pamphlets. The Bone has much good natured , contains many painfull facts, and shows in a strong light what manner of Spirit actuates the pretended Patriots. HeThe writer has in some places taken, a poetical Licence. I have not offerd it where I am. Society and Interest will and dissapointed ambition will have their influence upon most minds. Be assured I am remarkably cautious upon the Subject of politicks. I am satisfied mine would essentially clash with any one, who could call the peace System, a milk and water System. I hope and trust the decision upon the Treaty will be a Wise and candid one. That it should not be suddenly rejected or accepted will I believe be more acceptable to the people than if it was other ways. I hope however a fortnight at furthest will be found sufficient. My Health has been much mended by my Journey. Johns Ague after 3 fits of it, terminated by falling into his face. You mention having read a part of the dispatches from the Hague, Are they made  to the Senate? My best respects to the President and Mrs. Washington. Love to Mrs. Otis, Betsy Smith &c.   Most  Yours  A Adams Have you read G. Adams  to the assembly. It is seasoned a little.   "
June 18 1795,"My Dearest Friend I received Yours of the 12th. I wish Congress may rise by the time you mention. A Gentleman reported here Yesterday that he had heard that Mr. Langdon had said he was  to oppose the Treaty in every article. People are very anxious. The Col. had Letters from  Halifax which informs him that without Libeling the vessel, they proceed to unload her and will not permit the Captain nor a single hand belonging to the vessel to be on Board. Mr. de La tomb came Yesterday to see me, and is to Breakfast here this morning. He looks thin, but I believe considers himself a very fortunate Man to be able to return to  America with his Head upon his Shoulders. He is very communicative respecting the State of France both when he arrived there, and when he left it. Says he has dispatches from our Son to the Secretary of State, that he inquired after him of the Commissioners from  Holland, that they informd him, that the Minister and his Secretary were much respected there. I was glad to hear that You were well. I hope you will be cautious of the Hot Suns, and the reflection from the houses and that you will get an umbrella. I wackt out Yesterday a little way near the middle of the day, and felt such a sensation from the Heat of the sun as I never before experienced,  Tho I had an umbrella and the distance was short I was near fainting. Mrs. Fitch sent me home in her Carriage. I have had the Headacke ever since. I have often heard of the Brick and stone reflection, but I never felt the force of the Sun in such a manner before. Mrs. Smith and children are well. I have not heard again from  Quincy  "

","My dearest Friend I received Yesterday Yours of the 14 and 11. I am happy to learn that you are Well and hope the Senate will not be obliged to sit longer than tomorrow. I saw Mr. Fry last Evening. By the Manner of his speaking I thought he did not expect they would get up so soon. The Anti's know not how to contain, themselves, at the Secrecy of the Senate. They wish to be  the whole time, and stand with their mouths open ready to sit up the Halloo. We see by the Report of Merlin in the Name of the committe of publick safety, this day publishd in the Gayzet, the declaration of the Essential principals of Social order, as they are called, every article of which is to guard against the domination of self created Societies, and incendary publications. I rejoice with you in the late receipt of intelligence from our dear Sons. Mrs. Smith has letters to the 16 of April and Charles to the 9th. I would hope you may have some too. I presume the Secretary of State has dispatches. They give a pleasing account of their Health and of their personal Safety and tranquility. The letters are excellent as usual. You will so soon see them that it is needless to make any extracts from them. I am glad you wrote me about the Medallion. I did not  to ask you. I knew the Subject gave you pain. I think  however that you had better see Mead, and shew him the Letter to bar any future demand. General Gates desires his respects to you and says you must go out to Rose Hill and go over his Farm one day before you return home. I presume you will only stop here one day. Present my kind regards to Mrs. Washington. I should be happy to see her. John is better. I think as Mrs. Washington did that it was a Worm Ague.

","My dearest Friend I was  before I left home of such a Seige as has taken place. What ever else may be objected to the Treaty that of a hasty decision cannot and ought not to be of the Number, as people are all alive upon the Subject. There are no doubt many Speaches put into the Mouths of particular Senators according to their former Sentiments and opinions. One day we here of very Warm Debates, an other, that there will be no decision, but the Treaty will be deferd to the Next Meeting of Congress. But What I fancy is More founded on Truth is what a Gentleman wrote his Friend from  Philadelphia. We know no more about the Treaty here, than if the Senate were sitting in  Siberia."" I can have nothing to detain me here after You come. I am anxious to return and dread the Heat, both for You and myself.  Smith has received Letters from his Agent at  Halifax. After unlaiding the vessel clear to the bottom in Serch of Some brass cannon which they were informd she had and finding none   nor any Naval Stores, they reloaded her and sufferd her to sail after detaining her a Month in the buisness. I was happy in the receipt of the Letters You sent me, and rejoiced that any of mine had at last got safe to Hand. Boston Chronical goes on in its accustomed stile of abuse. G. Knox has got his share, Lord of Maine &c. &c. We are all well. I have not any intelligence from home. I wrote last week that I was in hopes of sitting out on the  of this.  Adieu Yours      "

N York 25 June 1795
","My Dearest Friend I received Yours of 23d. It is reported here that 19 Senators are for a ratification of all but the 12th Article of the Treaty. Greenleafs paper contains daily some weak, foolish, superficial, sausy reflections and abuses upon the Senate, the President and the supposed Treaty but they cannot make an impression; but upon such Minds as are, as weak, foolish, and superficial as the Writers. Have you read Pelets  on the 8 of April upon the External and internal Situation of the Republick of  France. It contains many judicious observations and reflections. He evidently aims at a balance of power tho he dare not speak out baldly. ""What he observes is the Guarantee in the constitution of 1773 which insures to the Nation a lasting Republican existance? Where is the force, where is the protecting institution which shelters the Nation from innovations on the part of the legislators? Ought we not to surround Liberty with more secure formalities and with more solid barriers? Does Liberty exist in a Country where a power detached from the people, altho sit up by them would enjoy the strange capacity of giving them arbitrary Constitutional laws; or without consulting them; change their opinions, their manners, their Character and their Religion according to the convenience or capacity of the Legislators? As long as the political Goverment of the Nation shall be intrusted in the hands of persons who can offer me no other Security but their presumed probity, I shall always fear their  ambition, I shall never set confidence in Men. The Law alone must be my Security. I have no reliance but upon the Law; I believe only the premises of the Law. Of the constitution of 93 he observes that it is the general opinion that its principles are those of Democracy; but some say it wants a Spring, but I say it wants also Wheels and to be sit in Motion. A constitution ought to include every thing which interests the Liberty of a Country and that of every individual.""  Read the whole Speach. It is well worth a perusal tho the Speaker like all the rest of his countrymen, does not appear to have thought deeply upon the Subject of Govenment, Yet he has thrown out many wise and judicious observations. I am however of Stuarts (the great Walkers) Mind who says he told Tom Paine, that he might as well teach a Hen to swim as make a real Republican of a French Man. I went on tuesday to Breakfast at  Rose Hill, General Gates Seat. I am solisitious You should see it. It is the most  Spot I have seen here, 92 acres of Excellent land, and a House to gratify any moderate ambition for two thousand pounds, was a bargain indeed tho only a Life estate. I walk with the General to his Garden, to his Farm house, and to his Barns, to his Feilds of Grain &c. He may literally be said to live in clover. He pointed to a parsnip bed in his garden perhaps a quarter of an Acre, and told me that he made 27 pounds from that spot the last Year beside sufficint for his Family and this Year says he from that Spinnage bed about about 20 foot, I have taken 20 pounds, and my Sparigrass beds neated 3 pounds per day during the  Season of it. The Market people go to the Garden and take it so that he has no trouble of sending it to Market. One man takes the whole care of it after it is dug in the Spring. The whole Garden is not so large as our lower Garden, but vegitables are very dear in the market, cowcumbers sold at 3 shillings a peice a fort night ago. Mr. Hammond has a Garden out below where we used to live at  Greenwich. He told me one day last week that his Gardener sold in one day 60 dollars worth of vegitables. When shall we Farm so? I have past my time very  since I have been here, but I know our presence is wanted at  Quincy tho I hear that every thing does on well. I shall be ready to return with you as soon as the Senate will give you permission. The sooner the more agreeable to Your affectionate P S We have a  rain to day. We are engaged to  Rose Hill to dinner. I wish I may not covet my Neighbours House and lands. I think my ambition would be bounded by such a situation. Just so much Land so productive, but we know not ourselves. The General has a Grindstone upon a new construction which I want you to see. When sit in motion it will go a quarter of an hour without any assistance so that one person may grind a tool price was seven thousand pounds for the fee simple of that place. It would now fetch 15 perhaps 20.  "

","My Dearest Friend I have rejoiced in the fine weather which has attended you through your, journey, and the good Roads. If you have had  as good as we have, some cold Days but not enough so, to freeze or prevent our people from accomplishing the plowing at the corn Feilds. The Shelter for the Young cattle is compleated and coverd with Sea weed. One day more will cover the clover with manure, and to day they plow the great Garden. One day they have been in the woods and one day upon high ways. This compleats the Tour of Duty. I contemplated Your keeping  with our Children at  N York and hope You found them well and happy. I received the Miniatures three days after you left me, and feasted my self upon them for they are most admirable Likenessess. I wish you would inquire of the Secretary of State, if he has had any later Dispatches, than our Letters, and whether there is a probability of  [illegible]   the children being in  England. I shall not ask You how the pulse beat, but wait the Presidents Speech. Nancy Adams, and Betsy Crosby have the Scarlet fever I hope not very bad. Present me respectfully to the President and Mrs. Washington. Love to Mrs. Otis and Family.   "

","My Dearest Friend This is the sixteenth day since you left me, and I have not yet heard a word from you. I hope tomorrows post will bring me a Letter. I wrote you on the 10th. The day before yesterday was the first Winter Weather we have had. A pretty severe Snow storm lasted through the day. It fell  and the rain the day before renders it bad for Wheels and worse for a Sled. The Weather is so moderate to day that it will move fast. Our people got the clover all coverd on Saturday. Yesterday Deacon French calld to setle his account, and his conscience not only permitted him to take the 4/6 pr. day but to Charge 16 Shillings in addition for his plow. I paid him 45 dollars wanting two shillings. You have seen no doubt the Federilism of Govr.  Gilman in  New Hampshire.  Maryland too has manifested their Approbation, and even  Virginia was almost persuaded, they comprehend the absurdity of it is, and it is not, or I do not conceive how they could approve of the President's conduct, and approve of their Senators conduct too. I am all impatience for the President's speach. O for Authority, and I would humble all Jacobinical wretches in the dust, I may safely say this since  France their great exampler has done so. I long to hear from  our dear Children abroad, We have not been so long since their arrival as now, without hearing from them. Let me hear as often as possible from You and write me all the News you will venture upon.  My best regards to all inquiring Friends from Your ever affectionate Mrs. Brisler and Family are well. She is here  and desires to be rememberd to her Husband.   "
"Quincy  December 20 1795
","My Dearest Friend The day I wrote you last, I received your Letter written at  . Neither of my Neighbours Black or Beals went yesterday to Town, so that if any Letters came by Saturdays post, I must wait till Thursday for them which I do not so well like. I should like you to write me by the Wednesday post, then I should get my Letters of a thursday. The account you gave me of Charles situation, and increasing  was very agreable to me. You did not mention Sally. Gentlemen are not half particular as the Ladies are in their details. I recollect when C L was minister for foreign affairs, he found fault because you was not minute enough in your description of the looks, behaviour &c. of those with whom your buisness connected you. Accordingly in a Journal you sent, you related some conversation and Speaches, and even handing Madam Lu Comtess, to sable. I cannot but figure to myself how immoveable and like the Marble Medallion you ought to keep your countanance whilst differing parties address you. The Speach of B. in support of M's Motion, which the Centinal informs us Bache has retaild, must have been one trial amongst many others, is your Senate Chamber crowded? Parkers politeness is execrated. It is impossible for the President to have given a severer rebuke to the Jacobins than he has done, by the particular detail of the flourishing and prosperous state of our Country. Those Lines of Pope  to me upon reading the Speach fraught with so much benevolence, after all the abuse and scurility so wantonly displayd by, a decaying dying dying Junto. As I hope they now are, Symptoms of Mortality appear in all their Limbs. I suppose you take Bache paper upon the same principal that you wanted the , and as their is no Wife to prevent it. I should like to see Butlers Speach. Pray inclose it to me. Are the reflections upon Peace by Madam De Stael, to be had here? If so be so kind as to send them. Our people began the  you mentiond, but were driven of by bad weather. We are like to have Snow enough.   "

","My Dearest Friend Your Letter dated the 9th the blundering Post carried with him to Barnestible, so that I did not get it till the next week. Yours of the 13th came duly to Hand. The extracts with which you have  me, are curious, and prove a weak Head. Of the Heart, I shall say nothing. It does not appear that Fauchett, as has been reported went to Randolph to complain of British influence, but Randolph to him. Fauchett as well he might, despises the Man, as well as the pretended patriots, and his reflections are naturel and Judicious,tho I think he shows his want of knowledge, when he supposes that a few thousand Dollors could have turnd the Scale for Peace or War. The pretended patriots never saved any Country yet, and tho they might have been purchased, the great Body of the people are firm. Nor do I think the System of Finance conceived by Mr. Hamilton the origin of the Speculating, Stockjobbing  [illegible]   Rage. It existed before Col. Hamilton came into Office. His System produced a confidence in the value of the funds,raisd their credit, and gave a full scope. Be sure by that means to the believers to dupe the faithless; these dispatches when made publick will do much service, but how Randolph is to get himself out of the Scrape, is more than I can Devine. I pray you send me the pamphlet as soon as it appears. The Senate have my Approbation  for their Negative. Marplot will do his own buisness by the doors of the Senate being open, whenever it is necessary to shut them. He ought to be voted out too. Pray who are the four Men whose Talents, Influence and Ennergy were capable of saving their country? They grew not in the northern Soil, if they thus trembled under the weight of British Debts at this day. What a Tool and what a Fool: The British King in his Speach to Parliament announces the exchange of the Ratification of the Treaty. An extract from an English paper of the 4 Novbr. says a ""frigate saild some days ago with dispatches to Mr. Bond and assurences that what ever might be misunderstood or disliked in the Treaty should be open to a free and Friendly discussion to cement the good understanding and Friendship so desirable between both Countries. The Treaty was forwarded to Mr. Adams the American Minister at the Hague, to be brought here and exchanged by him who has full powers to Treat further on the 12 articles."" A vessel is daily expected belonging to Mr. Lamb, by which I wrote to Holland. She went from  Holland to  England. By her I hope to receive Letters for which I begin to be impatient. I read the debates in Senate. The Government strengthens. Intrigue and treachery will not prevail  I am not certain that it will Live to old Age. We have had a few days of sliding. Two of them were employs in getting manure upon the , the other in the Woods. The three past days have been rainy and stormy. We are all well in the Family. At Mr. Cranchs  they have the Scarlet fever. They have all got better at Your Mothers. I wish you would let Brisler send me some flower. It will rise I fear.  With Sentiments of the most affectionate Regard I am as ever Your Seal with Wax  "
Janry. 3 1796,"My Dearest Friend I will try to write  it is with much difficulty I hold my pen, oweing to a very painfull Soar which gatherd at the Root of one of my nails on my Right Hand. It has been so painfull as to allarm me for several days least it must.be opend to the Bone, and to deprive me of rest. It has begun to discharge, and the yet painfull, is less so since I have not been free from my old Rhumatick complaints, tho, not confined with them, to the House. We have had very moderate weather and our Farmers have improved it by getting out the mannure upon the meadow and spreading as much as they could. They finishd this day getting it out. We do not go on so rapidly as some, but we are very steady. I setled with Bass and paid him his 16 dollars as was your agreement, and engaged him till the Eleventh of April for which I am to give him 22 dollars. The Farm Noat is taken care of and the the Wheels &:c. Our weatherwise Soothsayers have been as much out in their calculations as yet respecting the Severity of the Winter,  the political prophesyers respecting the stormy sessions of Congress, but I do not yet think the Scene opened. I calculate however from a combination of circumstances, the Triumph of virtue and National prosperity. I received  your Letters of the 16 ,  17  and  21  with Randolphs poor poor story, three O! jimmy Tompson O! Months in Hatching, A dark Buisness at best, and  The President whom Mr. Randolph treats so very unhandsomely appears with more dignity for the tenderness he  to The Man who can never be considerd in any other Light than the Fool of the party, the weak unstable politician, assumeing to himself an influence over the mind of a Man infinitely his Superiour and reminding one of the frog in the Fable who tried to swell to the Size of the ox till he burst. Where there is vanity there will be folly. Fauchet dispatches shew a pidling Genius. He knew very little of the real Character of the people whom he described, and less of their politicks, no extensive views, comprehensive no comprehensive mind, but as the Republick of  France can comprehend any thing and every thing, they may possibly make out a system in Fauchet dispatch, Tis beyond my comprehension. Many parts of it I own not withstanding Randolphs precious confessions. I propose the old play of a Wonder, a Woman keeps a secret should change its title, or else let the Lords of the creation confess that Nature is equally weak in Male and Female. A Mason and a Randolph have taken of the reproach from the Female Character. The answer of the Senate to the Presidents Speach I liked much. He hath deserved worthyly of his Country, and hath so planted his honour in their Eyes, and his actions in their Hearts, that for their Tongue to have been silent, and not confess so much were a kind of ingratefull injury; to report otherways   were a malice, that giving itself the lye would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it. Shakespear. My finger is so bundled up that my writing is rather worse than usual. You are so used to it that I suppose you can pick it  out, and if you cannot, there will be no great loss. Shall I remind you of the New Year, and congratulate you that we are one Year nearer the End of our Journey? Can it be a subject of Congratulation, that our Years as Life declines, speed rapidly away. And not a year, but pilfers as he goes Some  grace, that Age would gladly keep A tooth or auburn Lock. But Soloman tells us that in a multitude of years there is wisdom, ""That Life is Long, which answers Lifes great end, Whilst we can be serviceable to mankind, and enjoy the blessings of Life. I believe we may rejoice that our days are  out and write in mutual congratulation upon revolving years. I inclose a paper of Russels. Cato is as restless and as dissapointed, as factious and as turbulent in  plimouth as the Cato of  N York. Your Mother is as well as when you left home. She walked here this week, and desires to be rememberd to you. I am ashamed to send such a Scrawl, but I know you would be uneasy if you did not hear once a week from    Your affectionate  "
"Quincy  Jan'ry 10th 1796
","My Dearest Friend I received by the last post  your Letters of the following dates 21   the post Note,  24  , 25 and  30th  for all of which accept my thanks; we have been so unfortunate I presume as to lose Letters by a Melancholy ship wreck the last week. A vessel belonging to Mr Lamb on Board of which was a Brother of Mr Lambs by whom I wrote to our Sons, in comeing in last week was in one of our Winter Gales and Snow-Storms cast away near  Salem. The Captain Mackey a dutch Gentleman and 2 others were drownd, Mr Lamb and one or two others were washd on shore a live, but vessel cargo intirely lost. Our Neighbours are in great anxiety for their Eldest Son Benjamin whom they heard had saild ten weeks ago from  Hamburgh bound to  N York. A vessel which saild with him has been in more than a Month. You observe in one of Your Letters that you wish to hear my observations upon Randolphs pamphlet. There does not appear to me  clear about it, or in it, but the Mans Duplicity, weakness, Gullability and vanity. He represents the president as in leading strings, and between our selves, I cannot but think, that he had gaind too great an assendency over the mind of the President, considering how very weak a Man he appears. You know my judgment of him in the very first Letter he wrote to Hammond after he was Secretary of State. You know my sentiments of his Predecessor and my Friendship for him, how loth I have been to see him a partizen  of politicks I could not but abhor. Yet I think him incapable of betraying the honour, interest and dignity of the Government as this misirable Man has done. The President has been unfortunate in his States Men. I hope the office is more confidentially fill'd now with respect to Mr M.s private Life. I know nothing, but one general rule will hold good with respect to appointments to office, that a Man destitute of private virtue must want principle, and the Man who wants principle cannot be actuated by pure Motives, nor can he possess so exalted an affection as a National and disinterested Love of his Country. This has been so recently exemplified in the late Chief Justice, that no other instance need be quoted. The publick papers have mentiond almost every circumstance You related, and his insanity will sheild the Senate from, even Jacobinical censure.  [illegible]   For his Friends I am sorry. It is a pitty that he was made so conspicuous in his Fall. As to the Virginians, they appear to be most of them Randolphs. and by their Numbers have too great a weight in the publick Scale. I hope all Culprits will be brought to punishment, and that our countrymen will know how to value and Appreciate the sterling Coin, which has been seven times tried, from the base dross which only glitters without, but has no intrinsick value. Mandell and Wheaton will be throughly sifted I presume. I wish Genett Fauchet and his successors were equally ameniable to the same tribunal. The complexion of the Senate is highly . The House will have time to shew themselves. The constitution in  France appears to be organizing. Seyes wisely  belonging to the executive. Why it should be a Subject of Speculation to the Parissians, must be oweing to their want of penetration. The Executive will soon be crumbld into insignificance. Seyes had rather be one than five. I hope they will keep together untill a general Peace takes place, but I am sure they cannot be held by a  [illegible]  of Sand. I thank Mrs Washington for her kind invitation as well as for her frequent remembrance of me. The high esteem and regard which I entertain for her would render such a visit peculiarly  to me, were all other circumstances favourable to it, but I never expect to go further than to visit my Children; I shall go to no  that I can avoid. I daily know that expences, I can not say increase, but the value of Money diminishes. I was presented last week with a Tax Bill of a hundred and 87 Dollars 50 cents for the Small Town of  Quincy. I shall however take the Liberty to pay my doctors Bill, and other necessary expences before I attend to what my Neighbours do not discharge in a Year after us. Last week our people compleated casting Manure upon  Quincys Medow 60 Loads that is cart bodys full. The Ground was so soft it would not admit of loading deeper and it is all spread. Copland says as well as if you had been here. He wants half a dozen more load to cover the whole which he hopes to get by and by. Mrs Brisler and Family were well.Yesterday she danced as nimbly as the Youngest of them, the night before new Year. PS I believe You have become a favorite at Court You dine so often.  "
"Quincy.  Jan'ry 15th 1796
","My Dearest Friend Thursday post did not bring me one single Letter from you;  true I had no reason to complain on the Score of inattention, as the Week before I had four Letters but I suppose that I had Letters. and that the blundering Blockhead of a Post either left them in Town, or has carried them to  Barnestable as he did once before; we have got a new post, one of your under bidders, who cannot read the direction upon his papers: such kind of people as want the Reigns of Government. I had a Letter last week from Mrs. Smith informing me that her Children were sick with the Measels. I hope to hear soon from her again. Tis a very bad disorder. So poor Tom Paine is gone to see whether there is any State besides the present. Heaven be  that he is gone there, instead of comeing to  America.  ""If plagues and Earthquakes break not heavens design Why then a Paine or Jacobine?"" He was an instrument of much mischief; the Virginians are a very mad people. They will neither believe in the experience of those States which have been obliged to change from a single Assembly, to a Balanced , nor in the Host of departed Spirits who cry alloud to them from the Golgotha of their Allies, in every State they will  find some as discontented and as  mischievous as themselves. I was told last Week, that the reputed Cato of  Plimouth openly declares his dislike to the constitution, and wants to have a Single assembly. When such Men as he, Men of experience, Men who have borne a part in one revolution and who call themselves Lovers of Liberty, profess pure and disinterested principles, come forward and hold such Sentiments what are we to think? Can we suppose that they were ever sincere? Or shall we say with the Tenth Muse Guillotina ""These are the Men who  burn Your constitution to overturn To blast the Sages of your Choice They weild the pen, and ply the voice."" The lines which describe the  Plimouth Boys will never be forgiven, if their malice was not impotent, they would raise a Rebellion. I feel both pity and contempt for them, As to Jonathan Pindars vice, I had a hearty laugh at it.  poor wretch who was at a misirable Shift, when he could find nothing to ridicule but a poor Cast Wigg, which was a Singularity in no other place than the contracted Span of a few States whose climate is too Hot for the Heads of its inhabitants. I pray you would give Judge Cushing a Hint, for in the minds of some of the southern Gentry, his Wig will be a greater objection to his perferment, than all the Madness and folly, to say no worse, of a Rutledge. We have had  ship Wreck, in the last week. Captain Barns in the Ship Industry from  London was cast away upon  Cape Ann and every Soul on Board perish'd The Captain chest and the Log Book was Wash 'd on shore by which the loss was discoverd. The Gale of wind blew only a few hours. We have not had one severe Snow Storm, yet more losses upon our coast than usual. I believe Captains grow more ventersome and dairing. If there were any Letters from our Sons they are all gone. I know not where to write to them. I long to hear of and from them. Is the Treaty arrived as report says? Our  makes his Speach on twesday next so that I cannot send by this Post. I have not got any Letters from you this week. I do not doubt you have written, but the post office, or post has not done its Duty. I write once a week, but have so little to entertain you with, that I feel sick of my Letter when I have written it. Your Mother was here yesterday and is well for her. She sends her Love to you. My Health has been better than the last winter. I saw Mrs. Brisler yesterday. She went to  Boston. She and Family were well. Poor Arnold has been sick of a plurisy fever and his Life despaired of for near a week. Polly watchd with him last night, Hs is rather better. We have not had any meeting for two Sabbeths. Baxter who is one of the Comittee says we have no occasion for preaching in the Winter. I hope he does not imbibe the Sentiment from his minister. Remember me to all inquiring Friends.   Your affectionate     "
"Quincy  Jan.ry 21 a memorable day
","My Dearest Friend In the Annals of  France; God forgive them, I would say. Yet upon  to my Heart, I had a Doubt whether the petition was sincere. The Scripture tells us that we must pray for our Enemies, but it does not say that we must pray that they may not be punished according to their Deserts. The post of this day brought me the Letters of two posts viz  Yours of Jan.ry 2d ,  5th ,  7th ,  8th , and  12th . The transcript from our Sons Letter, as well as his Letter gave me sincere pleasure. I hope you communicated it to the President. If he needed any other further  [illegible]   proof to convince him of the corrupt System, and of the agents employd to abuse and calumniate him, this Letter is a key to him. Every thing there predicted has taken place  [illegible]   exactly as foretold. Some communications in Your Letters are a Source of much anxiety to me. My Ambition leads me not to be first in  Rome, and the Event you request me to contemplate is of so serious a Nature that it requires much reflection and deliberation to determine upon it. There is not a beam of Light, nor a shadow of comfort or pleasure in the contemplation of the object. If personal considerations alone were to weigh, I should immediatly say retire with the principle. I can only say that circumstances must Govern you. In a matter of such Momentous concern I dare not influence you. I must pray that you may have superiour Direction. As to holding the office of v p. there I will give my opinion. Resign, retire. I wont be second under no Man but Washington. At Length you have the  of a poor weak old Man, superannated indeed and fearing a shadow. The Virginia resolutions had been sent him, and it seems he was in favour of them as far as he dared to avow them, and declare in his speach, that the Treaty is pregnant with evil, that it controuls some of the powers specially vested in Congress for the Security of the people, and he fears that it may restore to  Great Britain such an influence over the Government and people of this Country as may not be consistant with the general welfare. How came the President of the  united States and the 20 Senators not to make this discovery? Surely they would no more have ratified such a Treaty, than Mr. Jay have made it, if they had  it in this light. I think he had better have left it, unnoticed than have come out in this manner, but it  fully that the powers of his mind are unequal to enlarged views, and that he is under the influence of the Clubs. The Senate would not commit the Virginia Resolutions, and in the House 56 to 24 were against commiting them. I am told the House will be Federel. I hope you will write to our sons by every opportunity, and send them all the intelligence you can. We have had a fine fall of snow which will enable our people to  getting home wood if it last. I have not read Peter yet, because I sit down to write you immediatly. My finger is recovering, and  my Health as usual. I hope we shall soon get more Letters from abroad. I have my Eye upon   Sieyes. I believe I construed his refusal to be one of the five, right. When we see the intrigues, the Ambition, the Envy, the malice and ingratitude of the World, who would not rather, retire and live unnoticed in a country village, than stand the Broad Mark for all those arrows to be shot at placed upon a pinicle.  But I have done. Upon my pillow I shall reflect, fear and tremble, and pray that the President of the  United States may long long continue to hold the Reigns of Government, and that his valuable Life may be  for that purpose.    I am most     Your   "
Jan.ry 25 1796,"My Dearest Friend You will  the answer to the Governours Speach from the Senate. It is truly Federel. I am told that the answer of the House which I have not yet seen, is quite as much so, and would have been more full, but for Jarvis who had interest sufficient to get some of the best part expunged. It past the House unanimously.When it was presented to the Governour he declared appeard much agitated, and said he hoped the House did not think that he meant to Dictate to them, but it has disgusted the Rep's so much that tis said he will, as he predicted never have the opportunity of speaking to them gain. Parson Osgood who was in the house at the Time the Speach was deliverd, when the G. came to that part he rose and spoke loud enough to be heard by those around him.  ""And I pray God you never may."" Be so good as to send me  porcupine. I have sent that to our son by my old Friend Captain Barnard who sails tomorrow. I wish if you can that you would pay Brisler 20 Dollars and take his  in full to the  to the 15th of Nov.br. I omitted taking a receipt as I designd to when I made him the last payment but that will compleat his Quarter. We are all in good Health, which is a great blessing.  I am as ever most    Yours     "
Febry. 3d  Quincy. 1796,"My Dearest Friend Yours of Jan.ry. 20th   me the last post. There appears a universal pause. We do not get any thing from abroad, and the State Legislature are so federal that no warmth or altercation is to be heard or seen. Congress are lying upon their oars, not hatching mischief I hope. The Chronical and  [illegible]   join issue, and go on with their mad rant, which is totally disregarded. The people have in general learnd how to estimate their contents. I believe a Subject which will excite all their feelings, is not thought of, or contemplated any more than if it could not happen. I Spent a Week in  Boston in the last Month, but did not hear a  of the kind from any quarter but those; he came and sit down by me, and told me what you had before written me. I replied to him, that such a report had prevaild the year before the last, and the last Year and I hoped it had as little foundation in Truth now as then. He said He believed nothing short of a storm which should shake the constitution to its center, would alter the determination. I replied to him that it was a weighty and serious subject to the people, the concequences could not be forseen, and I hoped the P 't had not taken his determination unalterably as this past in a kind of a whisper. I changd the subject as soon as I could. I askd no question, nor intimated that the subject had reach'd me from any quarter, but as a former Rumour it is a Subject which I tremble to think of. I am sure that it is a momentous one, if Such is the determination. I should suppose a Suggestion of the Kind would have been directly communicated, to you. The Government stands firmer I believe for the Shocks which it has received. The politicks of a foreign Nation are well understood in this State. I had Yesterday an application to me for the  Quincy Farm, a Son of Deacon Frenchs with his Brother in Law Bowditch. Your Brother says they are both smart Men. They proposed taking it jointly, if the terms were . I told them as near as I could recollct and attended to some minuts you left. I have a person who talks of taking the  Thayer Farm. They have it under consideration. Your directions to Copland will be attended to. We have Snow and it is fine getting home the Wood to what it is by casting. Copland and Joy are desirious of compleating that which they have nearly done; We are all well.  arm is growing better daily. There have been some cracks in the Brittle Wave at  Boston. Two  pr month for large Sums of Money, will require great gains to hold up long. Mr. Lamb as I supposed had  Letters from our Sons which he put in his own Trunk with a promise of delivering. They were all lost. Remember me kindly to Mrs. Washington and to Mrs. Otis,  and be assured of the tenderest affection of your   PS No mail to the Southard of  N York this week so I shall get no Letters. I suppose the ice in the  North River the cause.  "
"
Febry. 9th. 1796 Quincy","My Dearest Friend I suppose some obstruction of Ice in the North River, prevented the Southern Post from arriving last Wednesday, which prevented me from getting any Letters from You, of a later date than   20th.  the receipt of which I have already acknowledged. I hope to receive a large packet tomorrow. You will learn before this Letter reaches you I presume, the Fate of Jarvis and the  Virginna resolutions. Jarvis last week got a motion made, which he seconded to take up the resolutions. He was opposed by Mr. Tudor, Sewall, Custice and others. The Dr. got warm, and voilent. His passion wrought up to an excess, the House adjournd for Dinner. Jarvis went home, eat his dinner and fell into strong convulsion fits, from which he was with difficulty recoverd. He has not since been able to attend the House. The news papers will give you the dissolution of the Resolves and the motions which were made to prop them up by a small party. I have engaged the  Braintree Farm to Burrel. He is to have 8 cows and 8 young cattle, to find the Team work himself, except the carting on the manure for the corn land which I shall have  up immediatly. The Farm here I consider as engaged to Mr. French and Bowditch who are Brothers by marriage. I shall  have the leases drawn in three Weeks from this time. If you think of any further directions than those You left You will write them to me. To Burrel I allow a cord and half of pine wood for the dairy, to French the use of the Team to get his wood. Wood has become so great expensive an article that all who have been to me to engage the places are very urgent upon that head. I have agreed to these terms, thinking it better to let such persons as were known to us have the places than strangers. Fovens has never applied, his wife is unable to take charge of the Dairy. I had a Mr. Cooke from  Road Island last week to  [illegible]   hire the  Quincy Farm. I could not recollect whether you meant to let a Horse with the oxen, or whether the Tenant would be allowd to bring one. I suppose you would prefer French, tho Cook had good recommendations, had hired a Farm of 200 acres  [for] 5 Years which Farm was now sold. He however insisted upon being found wood for the Dairy. When these places are let, I shall feel my mind more at ease. I have agreed with them that they shall find all the Farm utensels except half the Dairy matters, and this as a Sort of equivelent for the whole of the Stock. I suppose they will be some articles which occasionally we must lend. You will send the Grass Seed in Season. We have had very fine Snow and cold Weather. I have not had my Health so well for many Years as this winter. I hope You can say the same of your own. Mrs. Brisler and Family are well.   "
"Quincy  Febry. 14 1796
","My Dearest Friend I received by the last mail the Letters of two, so that I fare as you do, and the stormy weather last post day prevented my getting Letters to  Boston  I had one ready. I cannot think the loss very great, for I have very little either interesting, or amuseing to entertain you with. Yet you are pleasd to express so much pleasure at receiving them, such as they are, that I ought not, and do not fail of being regular once, allways, and sometimes twice a week. I have to acknowledge Yours of the following dates.   23 .  26   29   31  and  2d. Febry.  for all of which accept my thanks. Some of them brought to my mind two lines translated from Juvenil I believe ""On Eagles Wings immortal  fly, Whilest  actions, are but born and dye."" Whether Mr. J. deserves the censure he receives on account of his  from his wife I know not. He may plead as Trusty does in fair Rossomond, that, She is ugly, and old, and a vilainous Scold, but as he took her I presume, for better or worse, in our Country it would not be considerd as a Legal course of divorcement, however pleasing a one it might be. His Friends here say, that there is a cause, which he will not divulge, out of respect to her Family, who are all Friendly to him, and who lay no blame to him on her account. His child  is left in the care of a Brother of hers, and as I have learnt the Divorce comes through the Hands of one of her Brothers either as Judge or advocate. I was informd that Judge Daws had received a Letter from a Brother of hers who spoke in terms of affection for Mr. G. and who did not blame him for his conduct. Mr. G. returnd all the property he had with her, and offerd to make a Settlement upon her, which was refused, As to the  Conneticut buisness, I fancy it has no foundation. Must he not be liberated by the Laws of the same Country which burnd him? If he is as innocent as an , he cannot rid himself of the Spot which in this Land will attend the separation from Dissolution of the Bonds of Matrimony. I was in  Boston near a fortnight and  I heard a good deal of conversation upon the Sale he had made of Lands, I never heard a Hint that he had taken or attempted to take any improper advantage of any one. I have asked the Question of those who knew, but were no ways connected with him, and I was assured that every thing was conducted openly and fairly by him, that he did not pretend to transfer any title but such as he had received, and that no deception of any kind was made use of by him. What his Agents might do I cannot say. They made 50 thousand Dollars a  out of their Sale for G. As Mr. Black informs me, Joseph and George Blake and H G Otis were the Agents. They Sold Mr. J. Russel, Mr. Joseph, Mr. Coolidge and other Nabobs, all of whom  were old enough to Judge for themselves, but after all these speculations and rapid fortunes are an injury to the community at large, they created Envy, they mortify the hard Labourer who has spent all his day drudging on, and acquiring property by pence, Shillings and pounds, they introduce Luxery and dissapation, and corrupt the Morals of the possesors, if he had any to corrupt, but as Mr. Black observed to me, a Man who has acquired property Slowly and has Something to lose will not risk, as he will, who has nothing to risk, or lose. The Southern Gentlemen think and believe that the  Gentleman are fools, but the Nothern know that they are so, if they can believe that Such bare faced dupery will Succeed, as that which you say is now practiseing. Aut Caesar aut Nullus, is my Motto tho I am not used to quote lattin or spell it. I have no desire for the first, whilst he whose Right it is ought to be Sovereign, but if the people are blind, they deserve a Jefferson, or some one not half as deserving. Yet I am sure it will be a most unpleasent Seat, full of Thorns, Briers, thistles, murmuring, fault finding, calumny, obliqui, discrage for I ought I know, and what not. But the Hand of Providence ought to be attended to and what is designd, Cherefully Submitted to. I am firm in the hope and belief that the true and plain path of Duty will not be hidden from us.  "

","My Dearest Friend Yours of the 6 ,  8th.  and  10th   came to me by the last Post. I too Sometimes get  but I always lay the Charge to the post where I know it ought to fall, but not usually writing untill after thursday post arrives here, I have not the advantage of the office here unless I wait for the next week, and a Storm will sometimes, as last week, prevent my getting my letters to Town, but my Conscience acquits me of Sins of omission. In that respect, I can seldom find more to Say than one Letter contains. Upon some Subjects I think much more than I write. I think what is Duty to others and what is duty to ourselves. I contemplate unpleasent concequences to our Country if your decision should be the same with the p. s. for as you observe, whatever may be the views and designs of party, the chief of the Electors will do their Duty, or I know little of the Country in which I live. Shakespeare says.  Some are born great, some atchive greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them."" You write me fully assured that the P. is unalterably determind to retire. This is an event not yet contemplated by the people at large. We must be attentive to their feelings and to their voice. No Successor, can expect such support as the P. has had. The first Ministers have retired, and a man without intrigue, without party Spirit, with an honest mind and a judicious Head, with an unspotted Character may be difficult to find as V. P. This will still render the first  Station more difficult. You know what is before you. The Whips and Scorpions, the Thorns without Roses, the dangers, anxieties and weight of Empire. And for the day of trial is at hand With the whole fortunes of a mighty land Are staked on thee, and all their weal or woe Must from thy good, or thy misconduct flow; Have you Familiar with your Nature grown And are you Fairly to yourself made known? And can You acquire influence  as the Poet further describes  To still the voice of Discord in the land  This is the bright and  light of the picture. This  a hard and arduous Task, would be a flattering and a Glorious Reward, and such a reward as all good men will unite in giving to Washington, and such a Reward as I pray his Successor may merrit and obtain. Should Providence allot the task to my Friend, But think not that I am alone anxious for the part he will be calld to act, tho by far the most important, I am anxious for the proper disccharge of that share which will devolve upon me. Whether I have patience, prudence, discretion sufficent to fill a Station so unexceptionably as the Worthy Lady who now holds it, I fear I have not. As Second I have had the happiness of stearing clear of censure as far as I know. If the contemplation did not make me feel very serious, I should say that I have been so used to a freedom of sentiment that I know not how to plane so many gaurds about me, as will be indispensable, to look at every word before I utter it, and to impose a silence upon my self, when I long to talk. Here in this retird Village, I live beloved by my Neighbours, and as I assume no State, and practise no pagentry, unenvy'd I sit calm and easy, miscing very little with the World. You need not be apprehensive least I should  your Letters or divulge What is committed to me. All rests within my own Breast. Not the least lisp has escaped me to any one for tho I love Sociabily, I never did or will betray a trust.   "

","My  Friend I believe I must devote this page to the History of Farming. Our people have carried up the Hill all the manure which they suppose  be necessary and which can be spaired from the corn ground. They have carried up Burrels quantity which will be necessary for the Land which is to be broke up upon  Pens Hill, and they are now getting down the Stones for the Wall on  Quincys Medow. No crossing the mill pond this winter, nor has it been froze hard enough to get into a swamp.

My  has arrived safe and yesterday I got it, and sent a Barrel to your Mother as you desired for which I know she will return you many thanks. Tho I have not seen her since, I saw her Arm last week. There is not the appearance of a Soar upon it. It is matter of surprize and proves the powerfull efficacy of carrots in such cases as the rose kind. Burrel has taken the  Braintree Farm. The other is not yet setled. Captain Beals has let his Farm here to the [No transcription available -- see page image].Billings might be hired I suppose  if you thought he would answer for us. I know I could have him, but do not know at what day. I should suppose one good hand with Copland, for I suppose I must keep him would be sufficient for this place. Write me what you think. I wrote Mr. Brisler a statement of the account as it stood upon my Book, and as it  by receits. I mistook as he supposed I had. I am very sorry that Judge Cushing has refused his appointment. Chace is not a Man from all I have heard, who will make Mr. Jays place good. ""How can a judge enforce that Law  some poor elf Which conscience tells him, he hath broke himself?"" The fountain of Justice should be as pure as Virgin innocence. The Laws can neither be administerd or respected, if the minister of them is not unspotted.

","My Dearest Friend Mr. Quincy and Mr. Copley made me a visit this afternoon. Mr. Copley arrived from  England about 2 Months since and is going to spend a Year in  America. He is the only Son of our Friend. I believe you may recollect him. He talks of visiting  Philadelphia. If he does I shall give him a Letter to you. Mr. Quincy seems much  with his Tour, and speaks with much gratitude of the kindness and attention he experienced from You, whilst he was unwell in  Philadelphia. I fear he will be a looser by the late failures. I saw a paragraph in Russels Centinel of Yesterday which is a very  and blind one.  ""Sum of the Southern Mail arrived last Evening. Charles Adams esqr. has arrived in  Philadelphia, and is said to have been charged with the Treaty lately concluded with the Dey of  Algiers, who has sent as a present to the President of the  United States an Elegant Gold mounted Sword."" No date, no place arrived from, mentiond. I do not know, nor ever heard of any Charls Adams a broad. I can not Suppose it Thomas. I do not know how he could come by the Treaty. The only conjecture I can make is that possibly Such an instrument may have arrived at  N York to the care of the Govenour, and that he may have deputed Charles as the Bearer of it to  Philadelphia. It is also said that  the Treaty with  Spain had arrived, and was sent on from  Boston. If so, the Senate will awake from their Slumber, and buisness will begin to be more interesting. Captain Beals as usual when he returns from Court, comes in to see me, and tell me as well as he knows how the News and politicks of the Week. His News of last Evening was that the President had determined to resign. I asked him where he learnt such News. He said he had Dined with Mr. J Russel and heard it at his Table. I asked him who the company were. He said a Number of Country Representitives. The intelligence was from Mr. Russel. I did not  to ask him what was said upon the occasion. I only remarked to him that such a Rumour had formerly prevail'd. I have written you several Letters this the week past. I hope, as you appear to be so anxious about Letters, that you will get them in due Season. I would not willingly dissapoint You. I have nothing very interesting to write. It can only be a solisitude to know that I am well for even the Farmers Calender is at this Season comprised in a Line. I am sorry to inform You, that we have two Lambs. Poor Rogues the Season is too cold for them. Yet our Men begin to grow very covetous about their English Hay, and do not like that James's Horses should spend so much of it. I suppose I shall be obliged to Buy Some. Trask  calld upon me for 8 dollars which he said he was to have for clearing a Swamp in Curtis's pasture, and I supposd it was right and I pay'd him; no News Yet from our Dear Sons. There is a vessel in from  Roterdam which left it, middle of December. She is at the Vineyard. No Letter or paper from her yesterday. I do hope to hear. Mr. Quincy made me very happy by telling me that you  to enjoy your Health very well this winter. I hope it may be continued to Your   Affectionate     "

","My Dearest Friend Thursday is my Red Letter Day. Then I usually get your , and a package of papers. The last thursday was particularly so. I received  Yours of the 10  ,  13 ,  15  and  17th. of Febry.  and two Letters from our Dear Sons one dated  Helveotsluice Novbr. 7th. from the Minister, the other of the 9th. from  the Hague. The Wind had been contrary for near three weeks, and he poor fellow cooped up in a paltry Inn, and cut off as he says from all humane communication almost as intirely as if he had changed worlds. But this he ought not to regret as it saved him from the danger of the perilious Novbr. Storm which proved fatal to so many poor Souls. A Letter from Thomas to J. Quincy of a later date 25 Novbr. says he heard that his Brother arrived in  London on the 10th. Neither of their Letters are political, to avoid I presume the fate which some others have met with, of being retaind when captured. Possibly Letters may have gone on to you from Mr. Adams for Thomas apology for writing only a Short Letter, was, that his Brother for want of better Employment, had amused himself during his detention by writing and sending him to Coppy a great Number of Letters of no moderate Length, which added to the  buisness of a publick nature entrusted to his care, prevented him from writing to many of his Friend's. I do not know whether I ought to send you Johns Letter. It is in answer to one you wrote him, or rather to that part of it, in which you mentiond to him Charles Marriage and express a Wish that at an early period  ""he might return home, and assume in like manner the cares and enjoy the felicities of a Family."" He observes that tis a Maxim of Rochefoucaults, that we some times pass from Love to Ambition, but that we never return from Ambition to Love. If this Maxim is true, he says, what respite is to be expected by one who has past from Love, not indeed to Ambition, but at least to its concerns. He proceeds and much more fully than he ever before did, lays open what had been the State of his Heart,  ""to Sacrifice the choice of the Heart, was all that prudene or Duty can require. It cannot it will not receive from my own controul, or from any other, the imposition of a different choice. If it can choose again, its Election must be Spontanious, without receiving any direction from the Will."" I hope we shall soon get Letters from him by way of  England. You will see by the Centinel that the Presidents  was celebrated with more than usual Festivity in  Boston, and many other places. In the Toasts drank, they have for once done justice to the V. P. It is a Toast that looks, I conceive to a future contemplated event. I am glad that your mind appears so well  for what ever may take place, but who in their Senses could suppose that you would continue to serve in your present Station with any other than Washington. Who could wish or desire it must be destitute of Your feelings or mine. To be the private Citizen would not mortify me, but there remains not a Man in  America whose publick Services entitle him to the Office, what ever his own opinion or that of his Friends may be.  ""All envy power in others, and complain Of that which they would perish to obtain."" I am happy to learn that You enjoy your Health so well. The Season is approaching when colds are . You are so subject to them that I daily expect you to complain. Every Body far and near are suffering with them. I have my Share, but hope it will not lay me up.  "

","My Dearest Friend You left directions that Mr. Pratt was to cut the Trees upon the plane for Timber to build a Dam. This he has done and our Teams have drawn it, but upon inquiry I found that there would not be half enough for the Building. I  of Dr. Tufts what conversation You had with him upon the Subject, and of Pratt what You had said to him. The Dr. recollected that You talkd of building an addition to the Barn of the same Size but that you did not conclude upon any thing. Pratt said he was not engaged to cut any more. The Season would have past before I could have received any answer so I thought it best to proceed and get the remainder from the Woods. I accordingly sent Pratt and his hands to cutt the rest, and our Teams to get it home. They did very well the first day, but the second comes a Thaw and put a Stop at present to their getting it home. It is ready for the first opportunity which I do not Yet despare of. The manure upon the Hill which was made last fall I suppose you mean for to be spread upon the Grass ground where it lies. You propose to let all the Salt  except Penny ferry and Swen or 10 acres which used  to be brought here. Copeland requests that the Thatch bank may be let, but neither French or Bowditch seem to covet it. Joy complains sadly of his Hay. The salt I mean, which he says was not half made and is rotten &  [musty?]. Our people make a similar complaint here at home, tho it is not so bad, but we are just upon Spring, tho there are three months yet that the cattle want Hay. There is plenty but they do not eat it well. If comfort consists in quietness I believe Dr. may say that his old Age is the pleasantest part of his Life. If he come forward in  America, and takes an active part, he may find that malice, envy and evil speaking, are not confined to  great Britain. We hear no more of debates in Senate than if the Gallery was shut. Tell Mrs. Green that I know she will rejoice with me, that the fine Hair which she solicited Genll  to leave her, was not as she prophesied sacrificed to the  [tomahawks?], that it still remains to  [adorn?] the head of the wearer now crowned with laurels.

","My Dearest Friend Our Little Town of  Quincy is become so rich that they can vote a Thousand  to Build a School House, yet can not pay a Tax to their Minister which has been due for more than two years. Your proportion of the Tax for the present Year including your part of the Iou for the School house  is 18 dollors 30 Cents. The  Braintree Tax I have not yet seen. Both the collector and the School Committe want the Tax. I promised Baxter that he should have 50 dollors of it provided he would make an exertion to get the rest for Mr. Wibird as he said he was determined to do by March meeting. Our Neighbour Joseph Baxter is the collector. Captain Beals has really made a fine story out to the Town and prevaild upon them to vote and Tax for this Thousand Dollors to Build the School House. I should have supposed 500 might have answerd as well. It is to be set upon the Green by the meeting house, built 2 storey high the School House to be divided, part for Girls and part for Boys. Over the whole a large Room for the Town to do buisness in, or to be let as an Assembly Room.  Quincy is to Rival  Hingham. We shall have an accademy, and being so much nearer  Boston Gentlemen and Ladies will prefer sending their children here. It will bring into Town a mint of money, and raise the value of estates in Town six pr cent, and all this I have done for the Town. At this very economical time of Building I fancy the cash will come harder than the vote. The Timber is cut and Pratt has engaged to Build it. Mr. Wibird has not been out but  once this winter, and then was not able to get in or out of the Carriage but with help. How can you says Yorick; Captain Shandy live comfortless and alone, without a Bosom to lean Your head upon - or trust your cares to? Next to that, is being seperated half a Year at a Time. No Man even if he is sixty Years of Age ought to have more than three Months at a Time from his Family, and our Country is a very hard hearted tyrannical niggardly Country. It has committed more Robberies upon me, and obliged me to more sacrifices than any other woman in the Country and this I will mantain against any one who will venture to come forward and dispute it with me. As there never can be a compensation for me, I must sit down with this consolation that it might have been worse. We have a young Gentleman preaching for us by the Name of Fisk. Upon the whole I like him better than any other we have had, In the first place he has an excellent . In the 2d he is very social and much of a Gentleman, and in the 3d he is a very good preacher. I do not however expect that we shall ever be so fortunate as to get all these qualifications united in a minister for  Quincy. The Season is mild, the snow is leaving us. I must think of attacking the canker worm if any such I find. Grain is rising fast. I am  I am so well supplied with flower. I have not been able to purchase Rye under 9 Shillings pr Bushel. Corn has got to Seven I hear. If our places are out I hope we shall not have occasion to Buy. I must soon have another hand. Mr. Bass s Services are not worth much. The old  Man has the Jaundice, and is weak and feeble. Copland has been so steady through the winter that I must keep him I presume provided he does not rise too high in his price. He knows so well every part of the Farm and the buisness, that with new hands I should be at a loss in your absence. We have had for three days last week a fog as thick as  Philadelphia, so it put me in mind of the old story. Growls &c. I hope to shake it of, for I am better of my cold, and the Bark I have had recourse to. The last of Your Fathers sisters  a fortnight since. I learnt it only from the Chronical for the Family never sent us any word, not even to your Mother who was here on saturday and desires to be rememberd to you with parental affection. I bought the Good Lady a winter Gown when I was in Town, with which she was much pleasd. It did me good to see how much, and I have it in Charge over and over again to thank you for the flower sent. I think her Health better for the discharge she has had from her Arm.  "

","My Dearest Friend Thursday post brought me  yours of the 20th. ,  23  and  24 . We have had a good Season for  and our Teams have stood still a very few days the whole winter. They have carted home all the wood cut by Vesey. They have carried all the manure up  Pens Hill designd for the corn. They have sledded some stones and they have carried up 96 loads of manure upon the  Honey Feild Hill. They have drawn all the Timber home from the plain and some from the Woods, and by the help of a little Snow again tho a small quantity they are going this day to get home some more. Our Cattle have not fed on Corn, oats or Barley. Be sure Copland has given them their share of English Hay, but all agree that the cattle look much better than they did last Year. I ought to have enumerated the manure carted and spread upon  Quincy meddow. That Ground I have retaind for this place. As soon as the season will permit the Hill before the Door will be crop plowd. Our people say the turnings are so short, that it will take more Time and is worse to plow than when first done. So much for Farming. The  Toast You sent me, I answer by one equally good, from  Ipswich. John Adams. May his virtues, Genius and knowledge long revolve the first planet from our political Sun."" Poor Samll got a Map. Samll. Adams, may not the errors of Dotage disgrace that Life whose manhood  was usefull to his Country. The Toast were all good and sentimental as were those of  Newbury port. 2d was the V President and Congress may the prosperity and happiness of the American people still form their eulogy. 8th. The Ancient Diminion. May the State that gave Birth to a Washington never tarnish her Lusture by disorganizing measures. 9th. The late self-created Societies. Peace to their Manes. May no sacrilegious hand disturb their Ashes. I thank you for Mr. Harpers address. A Friend had sent me one before. Of the 1 Edition, I cannot say that the thought did not occur to me, that the letter of Mr. Jays would be attributed to the motive . I believe it to be a fair and honest statement of his sentiments, written in plain a simple stile. I yesterday received a Letter from Thomas of the 1 of December which I inclose to you. I think we may expect daily to hear from  England. I hope to get Letters from thence. I shall send to Thomas by a Vessel going to  Amsterdam Peter P. and Mr. Harpers address. If you have all Camillus in a pamphlet, be so good as to send me one. We have only printed here 22 Numbers. I hope you will write our dear sons, particularly  by any vessel going to  Hamburgh or  Holland as the communication is more difficult, to him than to  England. Return me his Letter when you have read it. I know Law. He will never see 45 again unless he lives to ninety. He will do for a  Virginna Girl, who would stand no chance, where Black are so plenty  and manners so licentious of marrying one of her own States men, without some progeny. I suppose they are not over delicate in their feelings. I would not give up the Heavenly sensations of a virtuous Love, even at this advanced period of Life, for all the wealth of all  the Indias. My Children are much dearer to me than they could otherways have been, and much more deserving of my regard. I do not like these marriages of Jan.ry and May, particularly, when Jan.ry is batterd by passing inclement Seasons and connected with profligate companions, even tho a Jointure was to be added in proportion to the Age of the party, or the hundreds increased as the head was hoary, and the Frame enfeabled. There never can be with such a disparity, a durable union of Hearts. Age must blunt the fine feelings of the Soul, and the delicious harmony of according Hearts. Nature is opposed to it, or why has she placed at so great a distance from each other the Torrid and the frigid Zones? You must not tell the Good Lady all this story. Tell her that I hope Her  will be productive of much satisfaction to her, but that I say when I was young I liked a young Man much better for a companion than an old one, and cannot help feeling pained for my poor Lad who in his last Letter made so much of a confession of his past pangs and strugles; I think with Yorick, that Love is not a misfortune from a persuasion that a mans Heart is ever the better for it.

","My Dearest Friend Yours of  21,  March 1st.  came to hand on Thursday. I regret that Congress are like to sit so long, for tho my Neighbours are some of them pleasd to flatter my vanity, by asscribing to me a knowledge of Farming, I have really very little pretention to their encomiums. I find myself embarresed in the terms of leaving the Janus. I have endeavored to abide as near as I could by your directions, with Burrel I meet with no difficulty, except a trial to get Team work. French appears a fair open honorable Man. He had brought with him a Brother in Law, a Mr. Bowditch of who I had a good Character. I enterd into the terms with them, and after adjusting some matters supposed we were quite agreed, when all at once French appears very much disconcerted, and mortified, and tells me that Bowditch was discouraged from comeing on and had given up the Idea, that if he was capable of going through the whole by himself he would, but the expence of hireing help would take away all his profits, but if I would not engage it for a few days he would see if he could find some other partner. At the Time sit, he came and brought another Brother in Law, a Mr. Vinton. I know you will not like the Name any more than I did. I told Mr. French that altho I knew his Father, Mr.Vinton was a stranger to me, but I trusted for his own sake he would not take with him any person of whose honour and honesty he was not well satisfied with, and that I should consider  him as the principle. I have since seen and conversed with them several Times. I cannot say that I like Vinton as well as I do French, which make me wish more that you were here to judge for yourself. They are not willing to have any thing to do with the bogg Meddow. I do not recollect that you left any direction respecting that. They will not be obliged to take the medow bought of Penniman. They do not like to be restricted with regard to the Team unless you will engage to employ it at all times when they can use it. I shall bind them to this, to work for you when ever call'd upon, and for no other without your consent. The Steers which are to be broken they look upon as a trouble, particularly those which have neither been yoked or tied up. Deacon French says he has given the use of a pr. this winter to get them broke. I have consented that they bring on a Horse. When I  that we should both want the Team Horse at the same time, that one of ours would be useless this Summer, I thought you would have none at times for yourself and that and that I had better consent to their bringing one, than that you should have to purchase. I shall do the best I can, but I know and fear you will not be satisfied; our people at both places make bitter complaints of their Hay and say the cattle will not eat it. I must purchase immediatly for the Horses. You sit up your carriage when you enterd into office. I shall make no difficulty at laying it down when you become a private  [illegible]   Citizen. Altho I see my Neighbours on both sides enjoying them, it would be no enjoyment to me  to continue an expence that I could not afford. I should with ""To rise with dignity, and fall with ease."" And as I never placed my happiness in Equipage, I do not expect to have it greatly diminished by the Want of it, any more than  Hamilton whose ambition I dare say is not in the least diminished by the Sacrifice. I  you in my last a Letter from Thomas. I have just closed Letters to him by a vessel going to  Amsterdam. I wrote to the Minister last week. Are We to expect any heat as the Spring approaches? I am Glad the Treaties are all met together. They may serve to keep each other in .  "

","My Dearest Friend I received  your kind  of March 3 ,  5 ,  7  and  9th.  by the Thursday post. We have as great a famine here of News as their is of Bread in  Europe. The chief Topick of conversation is the  Georgia Lands. Their present Legislature have displayd state sovereignty in its fullest extent; our wise Men were never before so Ribbled. Our Wealthyest citizens are taken in to a vast amount. Mr. Russel, Barrel, Craggy, in short by what I hear, every Man of any considerable property far and near. What redress they can obtain I know not, nor do I know sufficient of the merrits or demerrits of the Subject to decide upon it. I hope however it will produce  [illegible]   one good effect in stoping that Rage for Speculation, which like an influenza has pervaded all ages and degrees of persons. I Yesterday received a Letter from our Son in  England of 24  by way  N York. He foresaw his Letter would be opened, as it appeard by the total defaceing of the Initials of his Name, it had been, so he wrote no politicks of concequence. The whole Substance of European affairs amount only to this. That they are very much exhausted, and very hungry. Peace is the great object of their wishes on all sides. The remainder of his Letters is taken up in relating to me the discovery lately made of some manuscripts, being originals of the hand of . Amongst Several of trifling im -portance, there is a compleat fair Coppy of King Lear, three or four Sheets, being part of an Hamlet, and an whole Tragedy heretofore unknown, intitled Vortigem and Rowena. You know how passionately fond our Son has ever been of that great master of  nature. He may truly be said to have inherited this from his parents. He observes that he had enough of the Catholic superstition about him to pay his Devotion to these venerable relics. They were in possession of a private Gentleman by the Name of Ireland to whom he got introduced and had an opportunity to see all, except the new play, which was purchased by the manager of  Drury lane Theater, Mr. Sheridan for five hundred pounds, and is to appear upon that Stage the present Season. Mr. Ireland does not hessitate to affirm that the Vortigem will be ranked among the very best plays of the Author. Among the loose papers, are a short Letter from Queen Elizabeth commanding him to play before her on a certain Day, a Coppy of a Letter from him to Lord Southampton and his answer, a deed from him or rather a Will to a man by the Name of Ireland, giving him several of his plays and a Sum of money, in consideration of his having saved his Life from drowning in  the Thames, a Love Letter to Anna Hatherrewaye, with a lock of Hair, together with some fugitive peices, and several designs drawn with a pen. All these are to make their appearence within a few days. You my dear Mother have long known  my partiality for the Swan of  Avon, and will not be surprizd at the interest I take in all his productions. I may as well quit here or go on to transcribe his whole Letter, not a syllable of which is uninteresting. He complains of the  void of solitude even in the city of  London. I can easily enter into his Sensations, and most redily believe him. Solitude is every where, when you feel not any particular interest in any one and no one has an interest in you.  ""I left he says my Brother at  the Hague, and I feel very sensibly the want of his company, While I had it, I could not consider myself as seperated from every object of my attachment."" Poor fellow I know he feels like a banishd man, condemnd in foreign climes to Roam. He will feel mortified too, if he should fail in the object of his embassy. I both rejoicd and mournd at the Appointment of Mr. Elsworth as Chief Justice, but what the Senate lose, the Bench will acquire. I rejoice that they have obtaind a Man of a fair Fame, distinguishd abilities and integrity. Ceasars Wife ought not to be suspected. This will apply equally to that office. We have had this week the most  Snow Storm which we have experienced for these two years. When I thought Spring was opening, as the Singing of Birds was come a heavy Equinoxcial gale came on accompanied by rain, frost and then Snow and cold. For 98 hours, it was very voilent.  I had begun taming the Trees, and Copeland was going to plow the Hill. We are all aback, but the remainder of the Timber will be got home by tomorrow Night. I must buy Hay as I wrote You but cannot get any under 5 pounds pr Ton. The Snow prevented my having a load this week. The Dr. tells me he could have bought seed at a shilling some time ago, but he finds it has risen very large orders having been received for the exportation of it. As soon as you conveniently can I should be glad you would send me a post Note. The collector is very earnest to get his Notes the beginning of April. I suppose the School house cannot go on. There are so many Town orders that they cannot get any money into the treasury. In the Spring there are allways new arrangments to make, and we have not a whole Tool upon the place neither spade, shovel, hoe, Sythe or any other thing but an ax. I hope We shall have no Sampsons this year. I wish you would write me of what dimensions you mean to have the Barn and whether you would not make an L. of H. Some advise to that as G. Gills Barn was if you recollect. They say it makes a better Yard. I shall make  to find how I can get the Frame hued. Mrs. Brislers Brother Baxter lost a Boy of 2 Years old the week after his wife with the Throat Distemper which proves as mortal here as the Yellow fever. We had 8 deaths in a week.  "

","My Dearest Friend I was sadly  to Day when James returnd from the Post office without one Single Letter. The Newspapers to the 11th. but not a Line. Post office or Post or Roads share the blame; I am more unfortunate than you when dissapointed, for you have two chances in a week, but I must wait untill thursday returns before I can get any Letters, tho Saturdays post should bring them. I see by the Papers the old Seven at work. The President knows what is Right, and they will not get any thing else from him. It is a snare to entangle him if they can. He will not be taken by surprize for he must have foreseen this. The latest intelligence from  France which is 26 of Janry. wears some appearence of Peace, and the British King has equal need of peace. The cessation of Arms between the French and Austerians has the same appearence. I hope at a time when other powers are thinking after quiet and repose, we shall not be driven into Hostilities by the rash and firery Timber of our Jacobines and that at a period when they appeard to be divested of their power, tho not of their inclination to hurt. The Weather has been very unpropitious for any kind of  for these 8 days past. The Snow came in abundance. It drifted into Banks and for two  Years past we have not had so much at once. We have tar'd but have not met with any canker worms. This day the leases have been compleated and sign'd.  Braintree Farm is leased to Burrell,  Quincy to French and Vinton and on fryday they take possession. I have setled with Joy and payd him and his Wife their last quarters Wages about half of which remaind due to them upon our Sittlement. I have purchased two loads of hay. Cleopatra will have an increase. I am much affraid I shall be obliged to purchase what I do not remember we ever did a Load or two of salt Hay; Whilst we have many Tons of Salt, and fish so Rotten, that the cattle will not touch it, our people say it was not sufficiently made and that it was stacked wet. I scold and insist upon their feeding with it, but the concequence will be that they will consume all the English. We have six calves already. When my new Tennants come, I shall hear what they say. The Sheep have eat near all the clover Hay at the little Barn. Copeland will have enough here but he has not any to part with, he says. We have had here our four Horses, an equal number of oxen and half the Young Stock beside the Sheep. Clover seed may be had at 20 Cents pr pound which is the lowest. The Dr. has been on the look out ever since you wrote me, but you was not early enough with your intelligence. Mr. Bracket will spair a hundred and 20 weight at that price. The Dr. advises me to secure it as it will be higher immediatly. I shall be obliged to borrow of the Dr. 30 pounds till I receive some from you. The collectors dun me as from the first of March they are obliged to pay interest upon  a part of what is not collected. I pay'd 50 dollors the beginning of March for Mr. Wibird.  "

","My Dearest Friend Captain Beal was in  Boston on Saturday and he  on the post master to let him take up the Saturday mail by which means I got those Letters which ought to have come on thursday,  Letters of the 11th. ,12th. ,  13 ,  15  and  16th . The greatest comfort which I derived from them was hearing that you were well. The prospect of sitting till June is not a very agreeable one, and the cause less so. What ever the Jacobinical party may think, if they should be so Head Strong and wicked as to carry their measures, they will find a ten fold clamour excited against them. I have heard it said, that those of them who belong to this State, would be torn to peices. The Warmth excited by the debates is greater here than I believe it is in Congress. Even your B who you know never was reconciled to the Treaty, says that it should be complied with. There is not any circulation of the debates in any paper printed in  Boston, but the Chronical, and that you may be sure will hold up, but one side of the Question. I cannot suppose that there will be a Majority in Congress hardy enough to overturn the constitution, tho there is a party who dare what ever they think may succeed. My last Letter containd some foreign intelligence which look'd like Peace, but the last arrival brings us no News of the kind. All breathe War and Hostility. The powers must be exhausted e'er long. I am no Friend to Club Law. Yet I cannot but own that I have been gratified with the behaviour of our American Seamen, in repelling the Lawless insolence of British Tyranny. Nor can the Britains be displeasd with a   Spirit and Valour which proves the Legitimate descent of their opposers. The loss of so many Seamen renders them more  [illegible]  eager to supply their place at any rate. I rejoice at the Opportunity Thomas has of shewing that he is equal to the trust reposed in him. As Private Secretary he could only be a coppyest. I think we have great cause of pleasure and satisfaction in our Children. I hope you feel very proud of them; I do I assure You. The  Georgia purchaser or rather the re purchasers are giving up all their Notes, and part with their Ideal gains with much composure. Serious  may however be experienced by some of the Hot Spurs of  Gorgia from whose proximity to their Savage Neighbours, they appear to have denied a portion of their ferocity, and infidelity. I have not yet engaged any Hand. Billings has been at work for your Brother. I desired him to talk to him for me. He told me last Evening that he held himself very high and talked quite wild about price, that he would not let himself but for a few months at a Time. I cannot hear of  Yet. It is Scarcly time of Year. I expect Copeland to top him self as he has become a Teams Man he thinks. One hundred dollors is like a drop in the Bucket. 33 for two loads Hay, 25 for clover Seed, 20 and 66 Cents for  Braintree Taxes, and 15 to Joy and his Wife. Herds Grass Seed the doctor has bought. We have Tard but do not find any Woorms or millirs Yet. Those certainly get through the World best who trouble themselves least, but a  prevents many Evils and vexations. As to the Wall upon the Hill  Amphions harp must be sit to a Golden cord before the Sound will compose the Walls of  Pens Hill. I sent to the undertakers three weeks ago to request them to go about it, but they say they were not engaged to compleat it untill the first of June. I do not know whether the Dr. is like to get the other done. I think it fortunate that we are like to get the places out. I am sure I know not where we could have procured help without paying three times the value of the produce. I shall be obliged to purchase Burrel a load of English Hay for his Cows. I did not bring away all from there, tho more than I wish I had. I hope his Salt and fish will answer for the Young Stock, tho he says it is not good. I am sure we never had so much English Hay as last Year, but our Salt was damaged, and the creek thatch they use only for to litter the horses with. The fresh, Tons of it, will go to make manure. I can not answer for the use of it. The cattle they say are in much better order than last Year, and so indeed they ought to be for they have not worked half so hard, and have been fed with English Hay in lieu of corn. When I talk to Copeland, he says Sir likes to have his cattle look well, and so does Mam, but not to have to purchase Hay for such a Stock. Well why should I torment You. Why because when one feels fretted, it is an ease to the Mind when it has cast it of. Adieu adieu. When the wheels get in Motion I shall be in a better , but chopping and changing makes a bustling world. I detest still life, and had rather be jostled, than inanimate.    "

","My Dearest Friend I Yesterday received  Yours of March 19  and  23d .  the Letter from our Son, compareing such events as have taken place in  Europe, with the Spirit, and Temper of the Parties in  America, and the evident disposition of foreign Powers towards the  United States. I believe our Son will prove to be possesst of  [illegible]  the Spirit, calld Prophesy which it has been said, was the property of his Father. In other Words, I believe from the observation which have occurd to me, that he will be found to have made a just estimate of Men and measures. I observe his prudent caution in not nameing those of his Countrymen who differ from him in opinion, but from Your reflection I presume it must be M. if not P. As to Sieyes I have long had my Eye upon him as the Cromwell of  France. How little do our Country men understand humane Nature, and what Superlative Ignorance do they discover of History, and of the Politicks of Nations. When they talk of a Republicks having no Secrets, it is really a pitty such Ignoramuses should be sent into a Legislative assembly as there are always two sides to a question. I hope light will break out in full day upon the combattants, and that Right and justice will be established. We may soon expect to hear from Abroad. Scott was to sail in Febry. I suppose I must not ask how the 12 article is like to be modified? Or whether Success is probable? I so frequently want , respecting our Home affairs that I wish you was here to make some of the arrangements, or that I had been more particular in attending to your plans. Some of them must vary, oweing to the Letting the Farms. There are three Yoke of Young Steers. Two of them are quiet to the Yoke, but one pr and the likelyest are wild never even been handled. Dr. Tufts wants a Yoke would you part with them? Two more Yoke are comeing on to be made use of an other Year. Is Your plan to fat two Yoke this Year? I hope I shall be able to go on with some buisness which I would undertake, if I was sure I should have it done right. I mean the Wall talkd of upon the Hill. I am weak very weak now. As soon as You enable me to be vallient I shall go on with Spirit. I should live a shot life upon credit. Copland says his time is out to day for which he engaged to You; I say not till the 15th. Whether I shall hire him again is uncertain as I hear from your Brother that he talks of very high wages. I saw Billings to day. He was engaged to make a peice of Stone Wall for Capt. Beal Which he thinks will take him three weeks. He then says he will come if we can agree, but I could not find what he intended to have. Your Brother says our lands must lye without cultivation for Laboures are for having all the value of produe and money beside; I must keep Copeland for the present Month if he will stay. I shall have some talk with  him in the course of the week and see what his expectations are, but here are so few Labourers that we are obliged to give the highest price and not always for the first hands. Shaw bears all the blame of spoiling the Hay put into the Barns, by getting it in not sufficiently made. Our  are moving, the day is Spring like and the Birds Sing. Our Worthy Brother Cranch is laid up for this fortnight with his old Lung complaint, which will some day prove too hard for him. I hope he is getting better. Mother has got through the Month of march without being confined, and is comfortable.  "

","My Dearest Friend I see by the papers brought by last nights Mail that the Question on Livingstones Motion was carried by a great . This may truly be calld a Scramble after power. What is to come next? Dare they touch the Treaty with unhallowd Hands? Giles seems all at once to have fallen in Love with Checks, and rings as many changes with them, as has been asscribed to the Author of the Defence. I have read his flimsy Speach repleat with Sophistry, calculated to catch flies, but not a toil for Lions. I do not recollect being more pleasd with any Speach than Mr. Backus simple, manly, and convincing. ""Plain Truth dear, needs no flowers of Speach. It is curious to see these Genius's quoting as an Authority a Nation and Government, which on other occasions and from the opposite Side, the would repobate in the severest terms. But what cannot party Spirit effect? It can see single and double, proteus like, assume all Shapes, and forms. This Said Mr. Giles, who appears to have some lose Ideas borrowd from a Work which I presume he never studied, or he might have learnt from it, a true picture of himself and party, and that the Love of power, like the Love of fame, how ever disguised by art, Glows more or less, and burns in every Heart that this tendency can never be eradicated, but ought to be so gaurded as not to prevail over the Laws, and in the Words of the to Defence, putting the Executive power into the Hands of the People is bribing them to their own destruction. Putting it into the Hands of their Representitives is still worse as it gives more opportunity to conceal the Knavery. Tomorrow is our Election Day, and after scolding and  the Old Man some, their Hearts relent towards him, and I am very certain from what I have read and what I have heard, all of which will serve rather than inure his cause, he will again be Reelected and I belive by a large proportion of the State. In the first place he lives in the Town of  Boston. That has its Weight with their Pride and Ambition. In the next place, they recollect his former Services, his Age, and his Virtues. Those take hold of their gratitude, and they know not how to bring his grey Hairs with sorrow to the Grave. There they have some merrit. They know there is not any other Man held up sufficiently popular to unite the people. These are the considerations of the Patriots. The Antis support him, because they think him a spoke in their Wheel. I own for myself, whilst I pitty his infirmities I should have been sorry to have had him dropt. There will be many votes for Sumner; and his Election will not be so full as the last Year. Tell Mr. Cabot that Mrs. Cabot  on me on her return from  Hingham, that she was well and in good spirits. We compared Notes and mournd the absence of our Mates, more particularly as the Spring approaches, that I sent my Love to him by her, and she sent her Respects to You, which means just the same thing. I have had a confinement for several days something of the prevailing Lung complaint. I hope it will prove slight, and that I shall be out again soon. Our cold March east winds have been the cause of it. You will escape their voilence I hope. Present me affectionately to all Friends. P S Mr. Cranch is rather better.   "

","My Dearest Friend It is with real Sorrow that I have to acquaint You with the death of so valuable a Man as  Honble. J. Russel. The Town of  Boston could not in the death of any other of its citizens, have sustaind so heavey a loss. Considerd in every Character which he sustaind and in every Relation in which he stood, his loss is greatly to be regreated, and what to him was always a Source of affliction, and to his family a Grief and mortification, he has no Son to whom his virtues have descended, or in whom his Father will live again; I received by the last post  Your  of March 23  and  29th . the latter inclosing the post Note. The day after, the Presidents Message reachd us in a Hand Bill. It is repleat with wisdom, firmness and Dignity, and I presume the hardest Strugle he will meet with. There will still remain in the House a party Enimical to the constitution, but I perceive in the last vote ten of their Majority were wanting, Whilst the Minority supports it self intire. With some the Presidents opinion will have great Weight, and the House will find themselves greatly condemnd abroad. I am anxious very anxious to learn the next movement. I rejoice to see the President steadily persueing his Measures to carry the Treaty into Effect. I know I feel very differently from what I should do, were I  [illegible]   more nearly connected with the administration of the Government, tho I should have no fears for want of firmness or integrity, but my fears would arise from an apprehension that, there might not be so general a support of any other person. May an over Ruling Providence direct all things for the best good of the Whole. Our sage Bostonians in their zeal for  their Goveneur permitted them selfs to be duped by the smugling party, and that misirable disgrace to freemen, that poor Spirited wretch Honestus mounted into Senate to the exclusion of the best Member in  Boston I Coffin Jones. The dispute in Congress, and the doctrines there Broachd certainly had an influence in the Election of that Man.  Boston is loosing her Men of concequence. I see none rising up to replace those characters whom we knew in former Days. Concequently her Counsels are unstable and her conduct Wavering; Mr. Adams as I expected is undoubtedly Elected, tho he lost many votes by his, I will not say conduct, but want of Conduct. I last Evening received a Letter from Mrs. Smith giving me a detail of the Mountabank Swindler St Hillair. I always suspected him to be an , and have been daily looking for some Catasthrophy which would develop him. The Coll. is inured by him, and that I fear essentially; Mrs. Smiths account is, that in the course of his Mercantile transactions, he came possessd of a Note indorsed by the Col. of five thousand Dollors. This Note in order to raise ready Money, he gave to a Banker and orderd him to sell it for a thousand Dollers less than the face of the Note. It was offerd to a Friend of the Col's who immediatly informd him, but the Note had been handed about to others, and given such a general allarm, as to occasion the Col. To put a Stop to his buisness, and come to a Settlement with his Creditors. Prehaps, this in the end may be no disservice to him. I wish it might serve as a check upon that too great propensity to extravagance in living, which has given so much cause of apprehension to the Col's best Friends. The Family have a source of mortification  and Humiliation in the Silly and as I always thought Ridiculous Connection of Peggys which they richly deserve, for their credulity and want of common prudence, and discernment. A son to a Govenour of  Brest, a page in the Family of the Prince of Condi, a Cheveliar of the Order of St Louis, might have been known by some humane Being, nor is it probable that a homely old Maid without property could have such Charms, as to engage a Handsome Young fellow merely for Love. No, No, those who know any thing of the World know better, especially of the Gallic World.  The Whole affair is a Romance. I suppose You have had more particulars from Charles or Mrs. Smith,  you have not written me on the Subject, and I did not chuse to write You the reports, because I knew not on what foundation they rested. My  are come upon the place. My confinement for the week past, has disconcerted some of my movements. I have had one conversation with Copland. He does not seem to like to stay or yet to go. He told me several persons had been a long in the course of the week past who wanted to Let themselves (but he took care not to inform me of it). He says because he knew I would not give their price, which was from 16 to 18 Dollors pr Month. I told him I hoped You would grase all the land you had, or put the whole out upon some terms to halves before you would give that price. Corn is at the price of 5 shillings I am told. Upon a Settlement with Copland I find he has received 40 pounds in 14 Months. He says he does not consider any thing due, for it will not make good the rise of Articles. I did not feel able to enter into  a Discussion with him. He says he told Sir last April that he expected the highest wages he gave to any one. I told him he knew that his agreement with me from Janry. 94 to 95 was at 8 dollors pr Month. This he could not deny. I am determined to get other help if I can, but it is very difficult not to have a single person who knows any thing about the place. If I must give unreasonable wages, it shall be to Billings, who with his faults brings more to pass than any other Man. I have purchased four Ton of English Hay. I must get one Ton for Burrels Barn, and Copeland says he must have some for the oxen here. This is so unexpected to me who thought from the Quantity cut last Year that we certainly could not want unless it might be for our Horses that I know not to what to  it unless it is an improper management of the Hay and Stock. Our fatting cattle were all killd before You left Home. Our Oxen have not worked but half as hard this Year as the last, but now is not the Season to pinch, so I must submit to what is unavoidable. The cross plowing of the Hill in front is nearly compleated. We have done it with our own Team, adding the Steers. Copeland says it is as bad for the cattle as the breaking up was. He plows as deep. The cattle cannot draw so firm. What a Jumble are my Letters. , Domestick occurrences, Farming annecdotes. Pray light Your Segars with them. Leave them not to the inspection of futurity, for they will never have any other value than that of giving information for the present moment of upon those subjects which interest you and  "

","My Dearest Friend From the posthumous play of  which our son mentions under the title of Vortigem and Rowena, I have been let to serch the English History for an account of them; I find the most particular and accurate in Mapins History, in the early period of the British history when they were over run by the picts Scots and having applied to the Romans for assistance, and receiving from, who was then prepareing to repulse Attila, an answer, that the affairs of the Empire would not suffer him to assist them, they agreed to chuse a Monarch as the only expedient to save them from Destruction. In 445 Vortigem is Elected, count or King of the Dunrovig This prince as he was the most powerfull and Ambitious, could never brook a Superiour, and therefore was a profess'd Enemy to the preceeding Monarchs, for previous to this period, several great Men had fortified themselves in various parts of the Country, and acted like Sovereigns. Vortigem is represented of an avaritious temper, not beloved by his subjects, Feeling his own weakness he proposes to call the Saxons to the aid of the Britains. His proposal was agreed to by the Britains, but when they came to consider the terms to be offerd to the Saxons, great debates arose. Vortigem proposed the allotting them some province, that their own interest might induce them to wage War more heartily and vigorously. Tho no easy matter to agree on this point, it was finally resolved, that the Saxons should have the  ile of Thanet in  Trent, and that the Saxon Soldiers should be allowd pay which should be setled by agreement on both sides, but Vortigems policy proved fatal to the Country, and might with other instances of a similar nature have taught Nations in modern times the fatal effects of foreign Nations gaining an assendency in politicks and Government of  other Nations. Three Instances now call upon Americans to beware and to take Warning from  Holland,  Poland and  Geneva. We now behold the Saxons landing in  Britain with Hengist, who is described as a young Warrior  with all the necessary qualifications for accomplishing so arduous an undertaking, possesst of valour and experience, a solid judgment, an easy address and engageing Behaviour. The first Battle fought proving successfull Vortigem in gratitude presented Hengist with some Lands near  [illegible]  who under pretence of a place to secure his Booty taken in War, obtaind leave to build Thong castle. Hengist soon feels a desire to setle in  Britain and instills the same, into the Saxons, being tempted by the first fullness of the Country and the Effeminacy of the inhabitants. Witigisil the Father of Hengist, sends him supplies and equiping a number of vessels, send in them Eseus and Rowena, Eldest son and Neice of Hengist, who having studied the Character of Vortigem and perceiving Love and pleasure to be his predominant passions, lays a Snare for to entrap him. and Hengist having expresst on many occasions much gratitude for favours received made a splendid entertainment to which he invited the King, and so contrived it, that Rowena should be present, and serve the King at table with a Gold cup filld with Wine. Vortegem was captivated and tho married, he demands Rowena in Marriage, in order to accomplish this, he divorced his wife by whom he had several Children, promises to Rowena the free exercise of her Religion, and gives to Hengist and Horsa the Sovereignty of  Kent. The Britains murmer against the Kings Marriage, which finally proved his overthrow and great distress to them. Shapespear has ample Scope for his imagination, and if the play is Genuine much pleasure and entertainment may be expected from the discovery to all  Lovers of the Drama. Since I took my pen, I have received a letter from our Son in  London dated  6. I know what he has felt, by my own experience, and so do you by a thousand instances. I will inclose his Letter which will give you more information than any extracts I can make from it.  [illegible]   Conscious rectitude can alone bear a Man through the insolence of office, the pride of State, and contumely of National arrogance, are very hard to suffer. When a Man feels that he is equal, often Superiour to those very persons who assume to themselves merrit by what they deem condesention. I received  yours of 1  and  7th. April  with the inclosures. I shall notice them by the next post. In the mean time  "
April 18 1796,"My Dearest Friend What you will say, or think, I know not at the Wages I am obliged to give. They are not higher than Mr. Black and others are obliged to give, for I was  not to be deceived by report, and made inquiry of him myself. Bass and Savile give the same which is no less than 14 dollors pr Month. Things can never go on at this rate. I hired a man on the 15 for one Month. He did not incline to engage further untill he had tried his place, and I was easy, for such wages must command help. He is from  Plimton and lived two Years with Judge Sever of  Kingston. As to Copland I know not yet whether he will remain, nor do I care, only that perfect Strangers render it difficult for me, as I can not mount on Horse back as You can and direct. The Stone Wall you wrote about and which you left in Charge to Dr. Tufts, he cannot get done for 2 dollors pr Rod. Billings who is with Captain Beals is to come to me in three weeks and will build the wall himself. I think I had better hire him for one, two or three Months, as he is so good a hand at such buisness and get it done in that way. Your Brother came to inform me that Mr. Jonathan Marsh had the care of the Land belonging to the Heirs of Hayden who own the Land you improve, and that they are of Age and offer it at seven pounds  acre 13 acres they say.  If you do not purchase it is to be sold at Auction. I shall get Dr. Tufts to see Mr. Marsh, and wish to receive your orders about it. Our Season is rather cold and dry. Our people are plowing upon the Hill in order to sew as soon as they can. The piece before the House for corn must be twice Harrowd, in order to break it to sufficiently. I shall go on as well as I can. You see the difficulties. Return our Sons Letter. The Throat distemper has abated. I do not know any person sick with it. I forgot to tell you that after repeated Farnings in various places and at different times, not a millir or Slug appears. I am much better.    "

","And why should I feel so anxious, so heavy at my Heart, and so depressed in my Spirits? I  help it. Aya, theres the Rub. If I could help the matter; Seeing the Subject in the light in which I view it, I would instantly comply, and vote the necessary measures for preserving the plighted Faith, the honour, reputation and the Peace of my Country. These were my Sleepless reflections, as I lay ruminating upon the contents of  your Letters of the 9th.  and  13th . I wanted to write the next day, but I could not take my pen. I could not sit down with a mind at ease. My reflections were painfull and my anticipations gloomy. Whilst I was in this State of mind Mr. Gardner arrived, and brought me Letters from our dear Son in  England, News papers and pamphlets. The pleasure of hearing directly from him, and seeing his particular Friend revived my Spirits, and gave me a temporary relief. The latest date is the 20 and 28 Febry. I have papers to the 11th. of March. His Letters acknowledg the receipt of Letters by Scott. He writs but little politicks. He says every thing in  England is very quiet, tho the Scarcity of Bread was constantly increasing, and that the winter had been mild beyond all example, that Mr. Randolph vindication had been publishd there. He observes  ""Among the thousand proofs that I meet with every day, of the influence that party spirit has upon the moral Sense, I have considerd it as one of the strongest, that there are Americans, who avow themselves of opinion that his  conduct amounted only to an indiscretion, and that he has been rankly treated. Whilst I am writing he adds I receive the  Boston Centinels to the 27th. of Janry. The Speach of the G.r. at the opening of the Sessions is almost as strange to me, as Randolphs vindication. Indeed the  Massachusetts have great respect for persons or they would hardly suffer a Man, depreciated to the delivery of such a speach, to appear in the face of the World as their Chief Magistrate."" He had been un well, and found it necessary to take a journey, which he did in company with his Friends Craffts and Gardner to  Cambridge. The excursion was an agreable one and was of Service to him. Thomas too, had been visited in Janry. with his Rhumatick complaint, but was better. He says that his last Letters from  America, after the meeting of Congress gave him a more pleasing aspect of the State of our affairs and encouraged him to hope that our Peace would be yet preserved, and that comprehended in itself the enjoyment of almost every blessing that a Nation could possess."" I fear his and our hopes will be frustrated, Last Evening I received  Yours of the 16  and  19th . There is not much more encouragement in them, than in the former but the Sensation is spreading far and wide; the  for the peace of the Country strikes forceably. You will see by the papers the votes and resolves of  Salem. The petition in  Boston was yesterday filld by 15 hundred Subscriber, and opend only the day before. The Clergy as a Body are uniting in a similar petition; there  An attempt at calling a Town meeting, by the old Jacobin party. As yet they have not succeeded. Commerce is obstructed, merchants are discharging their Sailors, underwriters refusing to insure the Mechanicks ask what does this mean? In an other fortnight the Damage will be more seriously felt, as the Stagnation increases. Whilst the  is thus threatned I can say nothing to induce you to quit your pound. Otherways I should wish you at home, and press for your return. The Season is uncommonly dry, more so than even the spring before the last. The Earth is like powder. Our people yesterday finishd the sowing and rooling the Hill. They next go to the potato Ground. Cleopatra has been turnd into the Green behind the Barn for this fortnight and has not had any Grain for some time. The Clover looks well. I have purchased six Tons of English Hay 4 for my Horses and one for Burrels Barn, and one for the other place. One more I must have here. I was fortunate to get it as I did. The price has risen to Six and Seven pounds in a few days, oweing to the prospect of a drougth. What can not be remedyd must be endured, but I am put to much of this expence, merely for want of useing the poorer Hay in its proper season. Surely we had more english Hay by many Tons last Year than  [illegible]   we ever had before. I hope the present Year we shall not Labour to such disadvantage as the last. To have to purchase a hundred and 20 dollors worth of English Hay, is too, too bad. Adieu adieu. Hopeing to hear more agreable intelligence I am most affectionatly   "

","My Dearest Friend  the Majority of the House of Representatives may think of their conduct, and motives, the people, the Sovereign people will support their constitution and no stab has ever been more fatal to the Enemies of our Government than what they will now receive from the voice which cries of from all  New England. Our Faith shall be preserved. We will fullfill our engagements, we will not submit to an usurped authority, and it must reach every state in the union. The Jacobins thought there Authority of sufficient weight to counteract the merchants who were signing a petition to Congress. They insisted upon a Town meeting. They accordingly met at  Funel Hall. They were two numerous and adjournd to the  old south. Tis said more than two thousand persons were collected. Jarvis made a motion that the President should be petitiond to deliver the papers. This was almost unanimously rejected. Jarvis, Austin were the Speakers on one side Dr. Warren, Coffin, Jones and Otis on the other. The Speah of the latter is much applauded, and is said to have been so pathetic as to draw tears from the Audience. Dr. Jarvis observed that personally this Subject concernd him very little as he found himself hastning to the World of spirits. Mr. Otis retorted upon him, that when he arrived there he hoped he would be satisfied with the Government, of it  when the Antis found how the pulse beat, they were for adjourning without taking the Question, ""Are you for requesting petitioning that the Treaty may be carried into effect, but the call for the Question was so loud and vehement, that it was taken, and the majority was as a hundred to one, in  Newbury port only three dissenting voices. In short the spirit is spreading far and wide, and the Country Towns are assembling. The Nakedness of the Majority  [illegible]   in the House of Representatives is discoverd and their conduct with respect to this Treaty has taken of the Scales from many an Eye. Whilst I see the desire of equity, order and good Government, rising up to oppose War, Anarchy and confusion, I feel ready to make every personal sacrifice in aid of the cause. I shall not therefore say one word, of when will you return? That I wish for it, you cannot doubt but I wish more that your Health may not be injured by so long and close application. I also wish that a just, speedy and happy termination may be the issue of this contest, and that the Government may stand firmer and surer for having been thus assaild. The  Distemper rages again in  Boston. Poor Genll. Knox has lost two of his youngest children in one day with it, two more lye sick. I went Yesterday and spent the day with Mrs. Cabot, and sweet communion we had, tho neither she or I relishd the Idea of next March. But this matter must come speedily to a close.  "

","My dearest Friend I last Evening received  Your  of April 21 ,  23 ,  24  and  26th . I think an other Week will discover the, Sense of the people so fully, that the Representitives can no longer delay to perform their part. I have not on any occasion seen so general and universal an allarm. The people have waited during a Months debate with patience and temper, expecting that in the end, the House would comply, but as they see them grow hardned, and the period nearly at Hand, when  Great Britain has stipulated to deliver the posts, a well grounded fear has pervaded throughout  New England, which has roused the Merchant, the mechanick, the Farmer. A large Majority of each will be to call upon the House of Representitives, and to warn them not to prostrate the Faith and Honour of the Nation. The circular Letter which you will see in the Centinal of yesterday, the 30th. has been sent here, and tomorrow is our May meeting, when it will I suppose be laid before the Town. Captain Beal, brought up those for  Quincy, for  Weymouth,  Braintree,  Randolph,  Stoughton,  Sharon, all of which he rode to, in one day and deliverd himself. I wish his knowledge was equal to his zeal, for that is to be commended. Deacon Webb enterd but coldly into the buisness. The Letter is to the Select Men. There was a proposal that the papers should be read after meeting to night, and tomorrow be signed. The Deacon thought that it would require a Month to inform the people, and he could not see what good it was to do. He however said, that he would communicate the papers. He could not come to meeting this forenoon. If he had he might  have learnt his Duty from the pulpit. Defend tho the Walls of our  Jeruselem, was the Subject, in discussing which Mr. Flint took occasion to draw a comparison between the strong wall of a city, and the Government of a Nation, and the duty of its inhabitants to defend and protect the one, as well as the other, particularly one so free, so equal, so just as that which was establishd over the happy people of  America, where every Man was at perfect Liberty to worship his Maker agreable to the dictates of his own conscience, and where the Laws equally protected the Lives, Liberty and property of all, that it was the peculiar duty of such a people to Gaurd the walls of their  Jeruselem against foreign invasion, and domestick division, that it was not only a political, but a Religious Duty. It was a duty which they owed to posterity, to transmit to them so fair an inheritence. The people listend with great attention. What our popular Declaimers may do tomorrow I know not, but I know they would generally do right, if there was one person capable of giving them proper information. Mr. Cranch is so feeble and unwell, that I do not think he will be able to attend, and then not being a native American he would not speak upon this occasion without some persons throwing out that he was an Englishman. Mr. Black tho meaning right, lies under a similar difficulty. At this very critical period I wish to hear from you by every post. I do not like one thing which is thrown out as a Threat. I mean a division of the States. We need only to turn to History to read our Fate should such an event take place.  ""We must not forget the old Liberty Song of Steady Boys, Steady, by uniting we Stand, by dividing we fall."" I shall see Dr. Tufts in the course of the week and report what you say. I have engaged Billings for four Months.   He comes tomorrow. I would longer but he did not incline. Copeland will stick by because he knows that he cannot do so well. I told him to go and do the best he could. I was willing. I would not complain, but if he did stay, he should not grumble. The Man I hired for one Month, I shall continue untill planting is over. This peice of Ground is very Hard to cultivate. It has been harrowd and now they will get on the manure, and Harrow it in. Some persons say, that cross plowing was a damage, but it is done. The Season is exceeding dry, as dusty as mid Summer, rather cold for this week past. If you think You shall not get Home till June, the 3d. week in May when the planting is compleated, I design to go and see my Sister. A ride I believe will serve my Health. I shall be absent a Week. My sister is fearfull of comeing this way least she should be sick from the journey as she was last Year, and both Mr. Peabody and my sister request me earnestly to visit them. The clover Looks well, but wants rain. I will pay Mrs. Brisler Ten . Be so good as to tell Brisler he must not forget paper, pens and wax of which I have made liberal use this last five months. "

 May 4th 1796  Quincy","My Dearest Friend The first sight which saluted my eyes this morning was a fine colt. The complexion however is more like the Father than the Mother. Having  you Joy upon this happy event, I shall proceed from this domestick occurence to an other less important, to viz. that Cosset like wise has three ospring of the same age with Octavia. They date their Birth from a memorable event too, for the inhabitants of  Quincy Yesterday very generally signd the memorial. If the Select Men, the Father of the Town had first signd, I believe there would not have been a dissenting voice. Your Brother and Mr. Black spoke in Town meeting, to explain the meaning and intent of the buisness. Webb, and Wilson Marsh were most in opposition, the latter of whom plead ignorance, and in his original way, stammerd out, that he would not chuse to see his way thither. Webb was sure, that it would bring us again under the dominion of  Great Britain, and he had frightned several good people with that Idea. Some however told him that they must think for themselves. About 60 signd the memorial at the meeting. It was moved to chuse a committe to assist the Select men, who appeard a dead weight. This was carried and Mr. Black  and Beal were chosen. Every Select Man refused to sign, because Webb would not. Yesterday we had a Raining. Captain Newcomb had some buisness with me in the morning. After it was finishd he askd me some questions pertinant enough. How it could happen that such a majority in the House should be opposed, to what others said was so hurtfull to the Country, and whether I did not think it would subject us to the power and Authority of  Great Britain? With regard to his first Question, I told him, in all large assemblies he was sensible there were some leading members, and that in the House of Representitives those Members, some of whom were Foreigners, from various motives were antifeaderel, that with regard to his other Question, he could have no reason that to think that President, and Senate would do any thing, any more than the people to Subject the Country to a power, against which the President had fought, and so often risk'd his Life, to obtain that independance which we now enjoy'd. I read him a passage from a Letter of Yours in which you say, that it must be a National Determination and that if the Nation determind upon War and confusion, You hoped they would not Charge it upon the Government. He seemd to be struck with this, and said he was not for War. He did not consider it in that light before, and that he would sign the memorial, which he did in the afternoon, and many of his company, so that last evening, Captain Beal told me that he had near a Hundred Subscribers. I observed to Newcomb that the

 if the Treaty with  Spain or  Algiers was opposd in the same manner, that the people ought equally to petition that the Faith and Honour of the country might be preserved by carrying them into effect, that it was not the Country with whom the treaty was made, but the Law full power and Authority which the people had delegated to the President and Senate, was incroachd upon, and that the Merrits of the Treaty was not the Subject before them, but the Support of their Government. This seemd to remove the fears he entertaind with respect to  G B. At  Weymouth, the Select Men requested Mr. Norten to read the papers after meeting, which he did, and the Dr.  to them the design of the memorial, upon which they signd it without opposition. I have not heard from any other Towns. The people will generally be united. I avow a selfish motive, as well as a publick. I want to have the Buisness finishd, that my long absent Husband may  "

","My Dearest Friend Winter has caught you on the Road I presume for a colder day than this we seldom have in  You will want to hear how the Farming goes on. The Letters inclosed which I received last evening have put it all out of my Head, and almost put out my Eyes to read. No other than the printed duplicate has come to Hand. I send you both Yours and mine, both of which are important at this time when the plots are unfolding. They are a clue to all the whole System of Electionering under foreign influence which in a greater or less degree pervades every State in the union. They will afford but Sorry comfort to You whether destined to publick or private Life. If to private,  ""O! Save my Country Heaven"" if we are to receive a President from the French Nation. What is to be our Fate? to accept the Presidency with such an opposition, and to know that one is rushing upon the thick bosses of the  [illegible]   Bachelor requires the firmest mind and the greatest intripidity. Heaven direct all for the best. You will see by the Centinal that poor Samuel has no opinion of his own. The House and Senate have however been firm.  is a curious extract from the  Washington Gazzett taken from a paper calld the New World. I presume the Fate of  America will be decided by the time I get a Letter from You. We are told here that under the Jeffersonian ticket the voters distinguishd themselves by wearing the National  [illegible]   cockade. Can they have become so openly and bold? I saw Burkes paper calld the Star. It ought to be termd the Chronical Rival, a Hireling Wretch, in French pay I doubt not, a whineing and canting because the French Minister has Suspended his functions.  Our Sons Letter is a key to the whole . I have worn out my Eyes to day in coppying it; The Wall progresses and the Barn Yd has Yard has not been neglected. The rails are all brought home and I am reflecting that there is no small probability that you may spend the next Summer at Home. I hope Peace Feild will not suffer a French invasion. I am not however terified. I say Gods will be done, and hope we are not yet given up to destruction. Adieu let me hear often from You. You know how anxious I am at the events passing before me. Poor  pride was a little touchd that you should name Cooper as a rival in Fame. Where will you find a man of his Age of his prudence, judgment, discernment and abilities? My best my sincerely affectionate Regards to the  and Mrs. Washington. If any people on earth are to be envyd they are the ones.

","My Dearest Friend The Weather has been and held so uncommonly cold ever since you left me, that I had no expectation of getting a line from You  you reachd  N York, but that line I have not yet received and by this Time I presume you have reachd the city of sedition, the Hot bed of  France. I wrote you this Day week, and inclosed to you our Sons Letters. Genll. Lincoln and Mrs. Lincoln dined with me yesterday on their return from  Boston and left me the papers. Centinal, Mercury and Chronical. All of them are nearly filld with Adets Note, and concequently leave little room for  [illegible]   Speculation. An extract of a Letter in the Chronical from  Virginna however, tells us that Mr. Jefferson will have an unanimous vote there. The majority of the Federal Ticket is given by the same paper in  pensilvana, by which I presume they have lost hopes of an alteration. Adets Note does not create any great allarm here. The Chronical as might be expected, shakes it over us as the rod in pickle, as an event to have been looked for after the  [illegible]   audacious treaty we had the assurence to make with  great Britain. ""Where is the American who does not behold the Salvation of  America, included in the protection the French Republick, but as if Heaven intended to chastise the Measures of our Government in not considering that the Cause of  France and of  America was one  indivisible, a Temporary  [illegible]   disaffection had taken place between the two republicks, which had now left us but one moment to reflect upon our conduct, and to decide whether we will declare in favour of Monarchy, or Republicanism. The French directory is the herald to  the Heavenly mission, and if we still adhere to our perfidious Friends the English, and disown our long experienced Friends the French, the concequences of our choice must rest on ourselves and posterity;"" This is pretty plainly acknowledging the Directory of  France, the Directory of  America. What American but must Spurn the wretch who thus insults us? I cannot give you a satisfactory account of the  at Home. The Ground is so frozen that neither plowing or Stone Wall can go on. Three days Billing worked upon the Wall two in the Barn Yd. with Vesey. Since which Vesey has been in the woods. Billings employd some time in makeing part of a new wheel to the Waggon, and has been twice in the woods. The Rivers are frozen and the harbour below hangs Man spared. We are apprehensive of want of water for the cattle. Billings says when he cuts the Ice the Stream Scarcly moves. No body so anxious as Billings. He comes for the News paper every day and wants to know if I have heard. I laugh and tell him I am very easy. Whilst I am writing the  Philidelphia paper of the 25 is sent me with Miflins proclamation declaring the Antifed Electors chosen. I repeat I feel very easy, and shall consider it as it respects myself and partner a  escape from danger tho I would not shrink from what I considerd an honorable, call to the Service of my Country. I need not urge it upon you to refuse the Station in which I presume you will be placed. Let no intreatys prevail with You, if our Country, or a part of it, is become so corrupt as already to bend their necks to foreign influence in so ignominious a Manner, they are fit for the Shackles which are prepairing for them.

","My Dearest Friend Captain Beal who is always attentive to the post office for me in your absence, brought me on the Evening of the Seventh  your Letter written at Stratford  27th. , which is the only line which has yet reachd me; I fear you sufferd from the cold on the journey, for it has been unusually so, for the Season. The continuence of it, has frozen the Ground very deep. I fear  [illegible]   we shall not be able to have our Hill ploughd this Winter. Our people get Seaweed and wood. Vesey will remain with me only untill the last of Febry. Mr. Bass is gone to Capt. Beals for Six Months. Very fortunately there was an opening for him there, Tim having left them. I am of your mind, that prices must fall.  Lincoln who dinned with me with his Daughter Polly Otis Lincoln last Saturday, on their return from  Boston, told me he had not heard such a cry for money, amongst the merchants for a long time, that he thought there must be some failures. He mentiond having lately made a purchase in  Hingham accidently at a vendue, of a House, Barns, out houses &c. Said he had no thoughts of its being struck off to him, but that it would prevent his building, which he was about to do for his daughter in Law who was with him. The House and place he purchased was the one next to that of Dr. Herseys and was formerly own'd by the Drs. Brother, a double House lately put in good repair with two Barns are quite new and an excellent Garden full of fruit Trees with Eleven acres of Land for four Hundred and 50 pounds. He observed that he could not build the House for that Money. The Electors are arrived in  Boston the day before the Election and met, in the Eve. Their great difficulty was respecting a Vice President. They could not agree  near Evening on the 7th. You will See they were unanimous for President, 13 for Pinckney, 2 for Gov. Johnstone of  N C., 1 for Mr. Elsworth. I am very glad that they were all in season, as it removes one Source of clamour, and the G. r might as well have let his Name have Stood, as recorded his own imbecility by erasing it. We are told that the Votes of  Vermont will not be legal. We had the same report respecting  Georgia. I cannot believe untill I see it that the old Chief Justice will give his vote against you. I yesterday had the  Washington paper of Novbr. 16th. There is a peice in it, dated  Virginna addrest to the Electors of that State. It is a recital of the Services you have been rendering Your Country for 30 years back. It is written with a warmth, a zeal and an affectionate remembrance of them, beyond any other publication which I have seen. Beals says that Adets Note does not make any great impression in  Boston, that it is  as a mere Electionering Scheme. There is however mischief enough in it. I believe this as critical a juncture as any our Country has seen. John Bull will have enough to do, to take care of his own Calves. He may make Love to us, but we know what value to place upon it. We understand matches of convenience as well as Adets Chrocodile tricks. With  England the questions To be, or not to Be? is a very solemn one, and Parson West will be looking for the completition of the prophesy according to his interpretation. If a very serious allam had not   taken place, a mission of so much pomp would never have been addrest to the Directory. I have not yet, a Letter from  N York. I hope You will give me some information respecting Mrs. Smith and Family as I have not had a line from her for a long time. Mrs. Brisler and Family were well Yesterday.  "

","My Dearest Friend On Saturday I received  Yours of  1 from N York . All wait in anxious expectation for the arrival of the Mail with the Presidents Speach. And this is not the only cause of anxiety. The result of Election is a Subject of greater Moment to them than at any former period. The Judge and Mrs. Cushing took Tea with me on Saturday. Mrs. Cushing who you know carries her Heart in her Eyes, told me that She believed from what She heard whilst She was in  Conneticut, that the vote would be for You, if it was left to every individual to determine it, in that State. I believe She Spoke as She felt, and perhaps in no State would the people be more unanimous. The Die is cast. We Shall Soon See what it turns up. The Weather still continues cold. Mr. Whitney has  for us three Sundays. He has in my estimation rivald every other Canditate. Dr. Welch Sent me a Letter which he received from Thomas of 30 of Sepbr. in which he Says the defeat of the Armies of the  Sambre and  Meuse and upon the  Rhine and  Mossele had changed in Some measure the gigantic projects of the Directory. Of us Americans  they Say without Stammering, that  Great Britain, has frightned our Government into a Disgracefull Submission and in order to mantain the Balance  France will undertake to Terrify the people into a rebellion against themselves."" This is litterally practising by our Jacobins when they give out that the French Swear they will go to War with us if the Vice President is made President. This Stuf is circulated not only in this place but in all the Towns bordering on  Boston amongst those people who attend the markets, and who do not give themselves time to reflect and consider it, an insult to be dictated to by a foreign Nation. Much Sooner than You thought of, have Your warnings and admonitions become   proofs as Strong as holy writ  is here and well.

","My Dearest Friend I received by the last post  your  dated 7h. ,  8th.  and  12  of the present Month together with Pains Letter and the counter part Jasper. I tremble when I look forward to the Scene opening before me. My own reflections and meditations are similar to yours except that I do contemplate a return to the Bar. Retirement at  Peace Feild I think would be a much more Eligible Situation than to be fastned up Hand and foot and Tongue to be shot at as our  Quincy Lads do at the poor Geese and Turkies, and like the frog in the fable, sport to the Boys was death to the frogs. Since I came to Town some curious Annecdotes have to me. Judge Daws after the Election was over, went to visit the Govenour so said the G. To answer their own ends. I say to answer their own ends Judge. They have sit up Your Father and me Electors in opposition to each other. If I had been Elected, I should have done something that should have cemented the Friendship of my Kinsman or severd us for ever. I hope Sir it will make no  I hope Sir it will make no breach between your Father and me. Our Friend Mrs. Storer says that the conduct of the Govenour in erasing his Name from the Law respecting Electors, putt her in mind of some lines in a little Book of the Childrens. A Country Man this Week who lives about 50 miles back was in Mr. N Austins Shop, and began to talk with him upon . Why says he, they tell me that Mr. Adams tho a Clever Man will not do for President. They say he can't talk. Aya says Mr. Austin, he can't talk Nonsence. But do you or can you believe that a Gentleman who was many Years in the full practise of the Law cannot talk? Very harmless was that report in comparison of a thousand others which I dare say have  come to your Ears. Dr. Walter call'd to see me a day or two since. He said there were many people in this Town who almost wisht you might not be Elected that they might have you for their Govenour next year. To this speach I could make no reply, but bow'd. It is considerd here as a Matter setled that you are Elected, yet no person speaks of it, but what seem to commisirate the station and to be fully sensible of its dangers and perplexitys. I  to you an Aurelias, the reputed Author Young Gardner of  Milton. It is certain that he corrected the press and does not deny the peice. I can not but Suspect however that he has consented to Father it for some other person. Tell Mrs. Otis that her Friends here are well, but in affliction for the sudden Death of Mrs. Robbins, Nabby Saltmass that was, who on one Sunday was married and before a fortnight was a Corpse.  ""O Blindness to the future kindly given."" Tomorrow I return to  Quincy where I hope to hear often from my dearest Friend to whom   "
December 23. 1796,"My Dearest Friend Mr. Beals will deliver this to you. He has a desire to be introduced by you, to the  and to Mrs. Washington. I promised to give him a Letter to you. We have had a pretty severe  of winter. It promises to be fine sleding and sleying. You will see, or doubtless have seen in the centinal of Wednesday the 14 of this Month, some Electionering Eloquence said by Mr. Sullivan who was present, to be deliverd from a Hogshead to a  Virgina Horse Man assembly. After the Races, the orator mounted, and undertook to give your origin and Character as well as your mode of Life, all of which are equally True. I understand Mr. Hitchbourn is very full in the praises of Mr. Munroe since his return from the southard. Says that to him is altogether oweing our being at peace with  France at this time, that we are under infinate obligation to him, that he presumes Mr. Pinckney will be received very  [illegible]   coldly. I am assured that this people are becomeing as independant in their Sentiments towards that Nation as they ought to be to all Foreign Nations and that they think and speak like true Americans.

","My dearest Friend Was it ever colder in this Country. The glasses have fallen much below 0.  a bright Sunshine on fryday and Saturday. Many people froze their feet, hands and ears. I really compasionate You that you must Sleep alone. Not one day here Since the 23 of Novbr. in which it has thaw'd so as to drop from the houses. The Snow is very level and near a foot deep. Our people are getting wood home. Billings has made a New Sled, and if the Weather holds we shall sled some stones. Water very scarce. We are threatned with a very hard and cold winter. We have no preaching to day. If we had the weather is too cold for me to venture abroad. I have read of Mifflins speach. It is more Complimentary than I expected to the President, and is not destitute of patriotick sentiments as it respects our Country. He probably thought an atonement necessary for the part  Pennsilvanna had taken in the late Election. Abraham ventured not so far as to limit his Number to one Righteous Man when he plead for the city. I would hope however that both  Virginna and  Pennsilvana have a much larger Number. The Hungry Patriots, we are informd have run beyond the bounds of their credit. I do not compasionate them. Their fall will serve as Warnings to others and eventually benifit the publick. The numerous Banks I hope will be diminishd, and a more rational system than these immense speculations, these Phantom Nabobs, will succeed to them, upon more solid and durable foundations. The President in his speach and the Senate in their reply notice  [illegible]   the inadequate compensation  of publick officers. I am informd that in the Houses answer the first draught of which was sent on last week as agreed to in committe, that no notice was taken of that part of the Speach. It is an evil of no small magnitude, and will in the event prove dishonorable to our Country as well as dangerous. We have so many restless Spirits in the union that I am at a loss to know who in particular You allude to. Pains pamphlet can do no Hurt. I most sincerely wish it circulated. It is so opposite to the voice of the Nation, so low and vilely abusive that neither he or Jaspir can do any other Service, than open the Eyes of the Blind. I am at a loss for the  of  Virginna, unless they intended that Burr should not be v p. I had no Idea but that those who voted for Jefferson, would vote also for Burr in that State. It was quite a surprize giving 14 to JA. Their policy was however weak, and their judgments wholy warped by Faction. Our News papers declare the Election, and have hopes of an additional Number of votes. Yet no person mentions the station, but as a post of difficulty and Danger. I could sincerely Join with Dr. Clarke and say in the words of Moses when looking to the Mount, If thou o Lord go not up With us, carry us not up theither. I have not any Letter from you of a later date than the  12th . I should be glad of a  post Note, at the New Year. My Blacksmith and Coach mender &c. call to settle for the Year. I should have been glad to have taken up Genll. Lincolns Note, before he goes on to  Philadelphia. The minority in the House of Reps is small. They ought to Blush. If they had any generous feelings they would. Is there one of them all whose Character if  by the hand of Justice, and virtue, honour and probity were put in the Scale, would not its opposite fly up and kick the Beam?  in wrong measures, poor Reptiles, censure is your due, and that from the pen & Heart   "
 Decbr. 31 1796 Quincy ,"My Dearest Friend I received by the last post  your Letters of the 14th. ,  16th. ,  18th. , and  19th . The frequent and repeated fires in the various capitals of  Savanna,  Baltimore and  N York are really shocking, but  vastly more allarming from the opinion that they are the effect of design, and not accident. I fear we shall America will be the harbour and assilum of the dissolute and abandoned of the Nations of  Europe unless more vigilence is adopted with respect to foreigners. I have had many congratulatory compliments in the week past upon the supposed certainty of your Election. They have not however been unmixed with the alloy which every person sees the station is subject to. Some of the Jacobins in  Boston I was told, declared they were glad you were Elected, for now they knew they should be  by principles, and not Names. They say It would be the President, and P. the puppet. With respect to Mr. Jay you know that I believe him an upright honest Man, not given to intrigue, and incapable of deserting an old and long tried Friend, a Man of Honour, a Man of principle, a Man of Religion. You may recollect, that I have often said to you, H. is a Man ambitious as Julius Ceasar. A subtle intriguer, his abilities would make him dangerous if he was to espouse a wrong side. His thirst for Fame is  insatiable. I have ever kept my Eye upon him. He has obtaind a great influence over some of the most worthy and amiable of our acquaintance whom I could name. He has allways busied himself in the Election of v p. as you well know. I received a Letter from an old Friend and correspondent this week who writes thus. ""The Election of our friend I hope is sure. The only adverse chance is that which  Mr. Pinckney, and if has the  North Carolina votes I think he will be Elected there being every reason to suppose that the other four southern and western states will give him their support. I was more apprehensive of danger from this quarter than from any other, and before we proceeded to vote, the matter was fully discussed, so that if by her own votes  Massachusetts should bring into the Chair a South Carolinian, of respectable Character it is true, but with little or no experience in the domestic politicks of the Union, and exclude a Citizen of her own, whose experience, station and qualifications, give him the highest pretensions to the office, she will have acted with her Eyes open, and must blame herself for her impolicy. The fact is as I am  from high Authority in  N York, that a plan was there laid by a quondam Secretary to bring in Mr. Pinkney, and that it was confidentially extended thro the Continent. That Letter was put into the  N York post office on the 30 Novbr. and was deliverd to me at our post office on the 14th. instead of the 7th. of  when it was undoubtedly in  Boston. Had I then received it I should have enforced the Argument for reducing the votes for Mr. Pinckney, and explaind the motives of some of the Electors who were for giving him a full vote. One of these confessed that he had been conferring with a Senator, and some members of the House of Rep's of Congress from this state, through whose instrumantality, this plan was undoubtedly communicated. I confess the conduct of that elector was to me Enigmatical untill I received the Letter."" E. G. You may judge from the statement here made, that the high Authority was aware of the snare, and exerted himself to ward of the blow. H. is as much suspected here as he is with you, and for the Reasons given by the Jacobins. They say H. knows you will not be . I am ready to think that enmity to Jefferson was the prevailing Motive. Jefferson I hope will succeed. I believe the Government would be more  [illegible]   conciliated, and the bitterness of party allayd. The former Friendship which subsisted between you would tend to harmonize, and moderation, coolness and temperament would reconcile the present, faring interests to concord. This is my hope, and I do not despair of seeing it effected. You know my Friendship for that Gentleman has lived through his faults and his errors, to which I have not been blind  but most sincerely regreted them. The whole Election has been a, fugal, in which you have been an inactive spectator. The Bostonians pretend to be very Angry with the South Carolians.  Massachusetts however seems to have been a dupe. My Letters are confidential. I wish you would burn those which might be injurious if by any accident exposed. I  to you an extract of a Letter from Thomas to his Friend J Q dated october 9th. by a vessel from  Amsterdam. I had not any Letters. Weather yet very cold. Adieu, and a good Night for it is Bed Time.   "

These need but thinking right, and meaning well, and may this ensure to you, the Souls calm Sun Shine, and the Heart felt say. I seldom think twice of a  but last Night I had one of so singular a nature that it has amused my mind to day with various conjectures. I was riding in my Coach, where I knew not, but all at once I perceived flying in the Air a Number of large black Balls of the Size of a 24 pounder. They appeard to be all directed at me. All of them however burst and fell before they reach'd me tho I continud going immediatly towards them. I saw them crumble all to Attoms, but during this Scene, two Guns were dischargd at my left Ear the flash of which I saw and heard the report.  I still remaind unhurt, but proceeded undaunted upon my course. How would the Sooth Sayers interpret this Dream?

The occasion of his going was the Sickness and Death of the man who lived upon his place. I have been obliged at his request to purchase for him Shirts and other Cloathing.

","My Dearest Friend I received  Yours of 22 Decbr.  by the Post of the 4 of this Month containing a post Note .  Lincoln left here the week before. I inquired of him if I could take up the Note in his absence. He told me it was in the office with his principle Clerk. Mr. Smith dinned with me on thursday and I gave him the Note with a request that he would transact the buisness for me. To day I expect to receive the Note and that the Buisness will be done.

I shall  my share in making arrangements at Home, but all those Matter I shall defer untill the  [illegible]   declaration is made. I am glad to find Mrs.   is like to be a reasonable Woman. She certainly might be one of the first, but there are some licences which she has taken so repugnant to my Ideas of Chast Decorum that I shall never place her in the list of Roman Matrons, nor can she ever be an intimate of mine. Poor Billings is off again ever since Thursday. I have not seen him since. Gone upon an  arbitration about his place. The Man has dyed insolvent. He is like to lose Money by him. I shall write again by the next post. I am now in much haste. "

","My Dearest Friend The Cold has been more severe than I can ever before recollect. It has frozen the ink in my pen, and  the Blood in my veins, but not the Warmth of my affection for Him for whom my Heart Beats with unabated ardor through all the changes and visisitudes of Life, in the still Calm of Peace Feild, and the Turbelent Scenes in which he is about to engage, the prospect of which excite, neither vanity, or pride, but a mixture of anxiety and Solisitude, which soften, but do not swell the Heart. By the last Post I   Yours of December 27th.   and  30. Janry. 1   and 3d.  The extract from Mr. Madisons Letter I believe to be the Genuine sentiments of Mr. Jeffersons Heart. Tho wrong in politicks, tho formerly an advocate for Tom Pains Rights of Man, and tho frequently mistaken in Men and Measures, I do not think him an insincere or a coruptable Man. My Friendship for him has ever been unshaken. I have not a doubt but all the discords will may be tuned to harmony, by the Hand of a skillfull Artist. I see by the paper of to day that the extract is publishd in the Centinel, not through Eve, I assure you, for I have not disclosd it. It has gaind as most storys do, that Mr. J. declares he would not have taken the vice presidency under any other Man. The writer adds, not unaptly, from Shakespear, My Authority for the Author of Aurelias, was William Shaw who going one day into  Nancreeds  Store saw a young Gentleman correctting the profs. Nancreed introduced him to William as the Writer of Aurelias and gave him one of the Books; notwithstanding this, he may only, as he has on former occasions for our son, be the Channel only, to convey and foster the ospring of an other. You ask me what I think of comeing on in Febry? I answer that I had rather not if I may be excused. I have not for many Years enjoyd so good Health as this Winter. I feel loth to put it to risk by passing a spring in  Philadelphia. I know not what is to be done. I think an inventory ought to be taken of what belongs to the  United States. A House ought to be provided and furnishd in such a manner as they chuse, or a Committe appointed to do it. If a Sum should be granted for the purpose, I desire to have nothing to do with it. There are persons who know what is both necessary and proper. If this is done I should not be against going to assist in the arrangement of the Household. I will make the necessary inquiry respecting a Carriage and write you word as soon as I can obtain information. My old Chariot, I have  harness and put it on. Dr. Tufts says it must never be hung again. It has long been too shaby for use. I was beholden to my Neighbours for a conveyance before I got them. It answers very well for that purpose. The Sleighing is remarkable find and has been so for more than a Month. I have had one succession of visiters and company, more than for any two years   past. Every body who ever knew one comes to pay compliments and visit who would not have been so forward perhaps.... A little prematurely too, but it shews their good wishes. I see no prospect of the fall of any article. Grain is as high as ever and all  West India articles risen beyond bounds. Such Sugars as were purchased last winter at 12  pr hundred are now 18. Loaf sugar 2/6 pr pd. Tea, Coffe,Chocolat risen in proportion. At this rate we must be starved if the House of Reps have not a Sense of Justice before their Eyes. What is to be done with our places? I have not . Nor have I seen Vinton or French since you went away. Barrel I believe will stay on if we find him a Yoke oxen and cart. He has not had a drop of water since last July. Billings is getting steady. He had but a small flight this last time, but he wants his money as fast as he earns it. I have been so much  by company that I have not been able to write for these ten days only one short Letter to you. I took up the Note and  it. I  you a Letter from an old Friend. It contains some just Sentiments. I need not say to you how necessary it is to lay ones finger upon their Lips, and to be upon our gaurd with all foreign Characters, and most domestick ones. I want to acquire an habit of silence, or of saying unimportant things. We have had a wedding in our Family too in the last week which has occupied some part of my Time. Nancy Adams was married on  last, and to day the New married pair dinned with me. Mr. and Mrs. Shaw are here upon a visit to keep Sabbeth with me, and desire their Respects to you. I am sitting up after all are a bed to write you that tomorrows post may not go without a Letter. You will write me and inform me what I must do, or what you wish. Cabot says I must go on or all the wheels will stand still, but I know better. Return the Letter when read. "

","My Dearest Friend I have made inquiry respecting a Carriage and send You the result. If you conclude to have one made You will send immediate orders as Mr. Frothingham has so many on hand that he cannot engage to have it ready  the first of July. We know his work and may depend upon him. French came last evening to see me, to know what was intended with respect to the Farm. I told him I had not received a line from You upon the Subject, but that you had said that he might tarry if he chose. Before you went away and I did not doubt but he might. Vinton goes of and French Seems inclined to take it alone. He will have I presume  New to offer. What I know not. I told him when I heard from You I would give him an answer. Barrel I presume will stay if he can have water and a yoke of cattle. I have not said  to Mears. Would you have me? Weather still cold  not so severe. We have not any arrivals or News. Every thing seems quiet at present. A Neat Chariot with perch carriage. Neat Wheels. Steel Springs. Tran. Axletree, folding steps, handsomely  full seat Cloth. Lamps. Full Glasses for Doors and Front. Handsome Harness, silver plated furniture body and harness. Silver Letters on Doors and handsomely painted.   "

","My Dearest Friend I have not received a Line from you of a later date than the 3d Instant. The last week is the only one which has past since you left me, . I hope it is not oweing to any other cause than the difficulty of passing  the North River. We have had this day something very like a snow storm. It has Bankd some tho not very deep. It is two Months tomorrow since you went away, and we have had only one part of a day in which any Rain has fallen, and intensely cold the greater part of the Time. I have something to propose to you on the part of . I think the remainder of her days ought to be renderd comfortable and respectable, that she is not now in such a situation as she ought to be placed, taking into consideration the station you will soon be call'd to fill. There is now but one Grandaughter left. She has necessarily the whole Family care upon her which will prevent that constant care and attention which the Age and infirmities of your Mother require. She ought to have a lower Room and not be obliged to mount up stairs, at the risk of falling. Mears has in His House a Handsome Room which I would furnish for the Good Lady, and Mrs. Mears has no children and could attend alltogether to the care and necessary attention of her. If I should be calld away and Mears should agree to come and take care of this place we could easily remove her here. I should have proposed taking her here, but we have so little House Room and the company would be urksome to her, I think she would be  more agreably placed in a Room which she should consider as her own, and with Authority to call for every assistance she wants. She told me since the marriage of Nancy, that if I went away she should have nobody to take any care of her. I assured her that she might make herself easy for she should certainly be provided for to her comfort and satisfaction, and that I would not leave her untill she was. I was sure it was your desire, and that I had in my Mind such accommodations as would make her so. If you approve of this I will propose it to her, and engage Mrs. Mears to undertake the Charge, and I will see every thing done to make her Comfortable. There is much talk with the merchants upon  Congress to lay an Embargo. The piracys of the French are very provoking and insulting. We have very few arrivals. Young Beals got home last week, but was near being lost in comeing upon our coast. We appear to be quiet here. The Election of Mr. A. and Mr. J appearseems to have quieted for a Time the Spirit of Party. I have not had any further advises from our sons. Are there any publick Letters from them? I have read Peters Censor. He is a full Blooded English Man. I want to see him craking Pains Bones. That Wretch has however now written a Book which even the Jacobines will blush to advocate. I think he has done his buisness in this Country. There are more persons who will detest him for his abuse of Washington than for his infidelity. Adieu my dear Friend, I will not ask when I may hope to see you, for if you cannot come to me, I will to you in the Month of May.  "
"Quincy  Janry 28th 1797
","My Dearest Friend I received by the post on  the whole Mail containing your Letters of the 6th  9th   11th   14  &  16th  . I began to be very impatient at rude Boreas for laying an embargo upon that intercourse which alone mitigated the pain and anxiety of Seperation.  Lincoln had call'd upon me the beginning of the week and informd me that you was well. The steady cold weather has been more favourable to my Health than any winter we have had for years past, and since I have been equiped with Runners I have not faild to take the Air almost every day. In one of my late Letters I inclosed you Frothinghams estimate of a carriage but as you have orderd one it will not do to apply to him and you will want one sooner than he could make one. I have been thinking that we shall want a light travelling Carriage for me to go to and from  Philadelphia, as you can not be left without one, and would it not be best for to sit Frothingham to make one something upon the same plan with that which we formerly Had? ""You say your Farm appears very differently to you now from what it did, and that it seems to you as if you ought not to think of it."" The greater reason there is for me to turn my attention to it, I consider it as our Dernier resort, as our Ark of safety. I think it ought not to be sufferd to fall into decay, and I shall not regret any pains which I can bestow upon it to render it a retirement eligible to us when we are four Years older if we should live to see the day. We have been doing, and undoing all our days. I would aim at making such arrangements as would tend to make it better rather than worse even tho I expended twice its annuall income. Billings has returnd to his Senses and conducts very well. He is going to sled stones next week, but it is impossible to dig them. We have had a covering of snow and Ice impenetrable to every tool, the finest Sleighing I ever knew. The Snow very level so that there has been no difficulty in turning out of the road, but for six weeks no rain and so cold as not to Thaw at all. The price of  which is good superfine has been in  Boston from 11/2 to 12. I have inquired divers times, and I gave 12 about a month ago. It is to be had now for 11/2 which Capt Beal has just told me he gave last week, but it is not of concequence whether any is sent. I can purchase it here. In one of your Letters you mention having seen enough at  East Chester, in  you exclaim alass poor Nabby, and say you have written to the Col. but get no answer. I received a Letter from Mrs. Smith in December, in which she expresses a state of anxious suspence, and a willingness to submit to her Lot with resignation if she could but know that all  just demands were satisfied. Speaks of a Col Walker as a Man very Rigirous and disposed to take ungenerous advantages. Mrs Shaw came here on a visit and spent the last week with me. She told me of many things which I did not before know of, and which I must give credit to. Some of them you had heard before from Charles. The Col is a Man wholy devoid of judgment and has deceived himself with visionary schemes, and run risks which he ought not to have done, and led his Family into a state of living which I fear his means would not bear him out in. You have I suppose before this Time received a Letter from me which an other proof of your old stuanch Friends confidence and attachment. Mr. Black told me the other day on his return from  Boston that  H. was loosing ground with his Friends in  Boston, On what account I inquired. Why for the part he is said to have acted in the late Election. Aya what was that? Why they say that he tried to keep out both Mr. A--s and J--n, and that he behaved with great duplicity. He wanted to bring in Pinckney that he himself might be the dictator. So you see according to the old adage, Murder will out. I despise a Janus tho I do not feel a disposition to rail at or condemn the conduct of those who did not vote for you, because it is my firm belief that if the people had not been imposed upon by false reports and misrepresentations, the vote would have been nearly unanimous. H--n dared not risk his popularity to come out openly in opposition, but he went secretly cunningly as he thought to work, and as his influence is very great in the  N England States, he imposed upon them. Ames you know has been his firm friend. I do not believe he suspected him, nor Cabot neither whom I believe he play'd upon. Smith of  S C was duped by him I suspect. Beware of that  Cassius, has always occured to me when I have seen that cock sparrow. O I have read his Heart in his wicked Eyes many a time. The very devil is in them. They are laciviousness itself, or I have no skill in Physiognomy. Pray burn this Letter. Dead Men tell no tales. It is really too bad to survive the Flames. I shall not dare to write so freely to you again unless you assure that you have complied with my request.   I am as ever most affectionately Your "
29 Janry 1797,"Yes my dear Friend I had seen and read the Tenth Muse, and I think she abuses our poor old  who tho quite in his dotage, is not the Man there represented. I do not think him a Hypocrit, but a real Lover and Friend of Religion from pure principles. He has served his Country many Years with honour and with fidelity. I respect his virtues,tho I pitty his weakness. It is said that he means to decline an other Election. If this should be the case, I will go and see him and Mrs. Adams as soon as they are out of Office, and shew them that personally, I respect old Friends and Friendships. Since I sit down to write  Beal has sent in his paper of Saturday containing the Govenours attoneing Speach, and his retiring Speach. His Notice of the Presidents retiring from office can not be chargeable with adulation. It is as cold as his Age, and as frozen as the Season. What he says respecting the importence of preserving our Election pure, is wise and just.Federal Commonwealth is an odd Epithet for our common Country. The old Gentleman could not refuse himself the pleasure of instructing his Kinsman and telling him he hoped he would stick close to the Letter of the constitution. He should have advised him to look well to the Laws before he puts his Name to them, for erasing it after it being becomes a Law is an act of despotism, a veto. The old Gentleman discovers some mortification in his farewell address,tho I can assent to the whole as truths which all must readily allow. Mrs. Washingtons congratulation to you I believe perfectly sincere. Who would not wish for a successor that would not disgrace his predecessor. Every person sees that the  pointed out his successor in his address, and in his late reply to the Senates address. I heard it said in company that he could not have spoken plainer if he had call'd the person by Name. I shall think myself the most fortunate among women if I can glide on for four Years with as spotless a Reputation, beloved and esteemed by all as that Good and amiable Lady has done. My endeavours shall not be wanting. At Meeting  a psalm was sung, a verse of which I could not but apply to myself. The  announces Mr. Madison appointed Ambassador extraordinary to  France. If true I rejoice in the appointment. I have confidence in the honour and integrity of Mr. Madison, that he would not betray a trust thus reposed or prostrate the dignity and independence of his Country to any foreign Nation, even tho that Nation be  France. Beside his instruction I trust would be positive, not discretionary. The little extracts  in your Letters diverted me, particularly Pompys scratching his Head with one finger. Be sure it was designd as a Friendly Hint. The writer did not know that the Scratching was sometimes owing to a cause which Peter Pinder celebrates. All peculiarities become conspicuous in proportion as the Character is exalted.  one shoulder had too high, the more luminous the Body, the more easily are the  Spots discerned. Adulation  envy. Honours should be meekly Borne as Shakespear expresses it. There are a Thousand Men in the  United Stats fit for Presidents, said modest Giles. Happy Country! Who surely will dispute the palm of most enlightned with us! My pen runs riot. I forget  that it must grow cautious and prudent. I fear I shall make a dull buisness when such restrictions are laid upon it, but you will soon be too full of buisness to be amused with what may create a Smile in your present solitary state. By the dates of our Letters we are often writing to each other at the same Time. If that be the case now, may the same sentiments inspire each Heart when we say we will never be for any other. Thus thinks  Your   A Adams "

","My Dearest Friend  is a Letter for our daughter which you will be so good as to cover and address. It is in reply to two which I have received from her pressing me to come, but that I had rather not untill I knew what was necessary and saw the means for executing, having no inclination to proceed in the dark or be involved in difficulties. Congress will rise in March. There will not be any great occasion I presume for the President to see much Company. As to House I suppose some one will offer. As to Furniture, some I suppose will remain in the Presidents House as belonging to the  United States. What may be wanting, if a sum is granted to supply it, and I am consulted upon it I can soon determine. Mrs. Otis may be consulted. She is upon the spot and is as good a judge as I could wish. Bisler is not unacquainted with such Things. Let the coat be cut to the Cloth. Nevertheless when ever you say the Word that I am necessary to your releif of care, of mind or Body, I come. In reply to me respecting the Farms here, I would have you as explicit as possible with regard to what you would have done.  is not like to be lower. Produce keeps up its price, particularly Grain, and West India articles are 25 pr cent higher than this time last Year. My mind is much occupied in determining what to do with this. I can not think of a more eligible plan that that which we proposed of placeing Mears here as over seear, he keeping his own House to retire to when I may  wish to return here of summers. I cannot think of any person so trust worthy as both he and his wife. Inclosed is a little plan which I have thought of. Mrs. Brisler will go to  Philadelphia when I do and make part of our Family. I have had several applications for the place of Ladys maid, but my answer has been that I have not made any arrangments. Amongst others Betsy Howard has applied whom I should like well if her Health will answer. A trusty person I shall want in that capacity. Polly will be married, Becky may remain with Mrs. Mears and little Betsy I would take or procure a place for her. If this plan should be agreed upon in our new lease with French had I better not have  Quincys Meddow inserted and let Mr. Jonathan Baxter take that meddow which he wants to halves. That would lessen the buisness upon this place. As soon as the Season will allow Billings says he will go on to compleat the Wall and should like to have Hayden to assist him. We have got wood enough Home to last us the Year. I wish you would draw and execute a power of Attorney for Mr. Quincy. I expect to have to call upon him to bring an action or two, against the Nightingales. Your Brother came last week to tell me that they had cutt in upon you largely and that if I would persue them now, he would never 
Page 3
 tell me again. Deacon Webb it seems sit the fellows to cut and cart him wood, and not finding a sufficient quantity in his; they have cut in. Your Brother thinks four or 5 Rods upon you. Vesey has cut this winter where your Brother has shewn him only. I immediatly wrote a Note to the Deacon informing him; and requesting him to send some person to meet Mr. Joseph Arnold, whom your Brother advised me to appoint; to run the line, and determine what quantity had been cut. The Deacon sent me word he would attend on Saturday last. Arnold agreed to go, but the day proving a very thawing one, Arnold did not go. The Deacon went with Joseph Bass; but could do nothing, as Arnold was not there. He has however stopt the Men, but he knew no more about his Lot, than he does about Government. He wishes however to do what is right. I have recived information that wood has been cut by Samll. Nightingale in the Lot call'd Babel. I am endeavouring to get proof. As soon as I have I will commence an action. It is not the first Time that fellow has cut wood knowingly in Your Lot. If I had punishd him then, he would not have dared to have repeated his Theaft. In this way we shall have all the Lots cut up, and they who touch my wood attack me upon my favorite Ground. Charls writes me that he has had to give 24 dollors pr. Cord this winter. Wood has been low here this winter in  Boston only 5 Dollors. Have you thought of a private Secretary. Why not employ the one already in the Presidents Service for a time at least. I am so little acquainted with the Young Gentlemen of the day that I cannot think of any one who is personally known to me that would do. You will no doubt have many applications. With the Letters which came to  Quincy by last Mail was one of Yours to an Inn Holder in  the Jerseys. Drake I think. By some mistake it was sent here. I sent it to the post office. I mention it least you should be at a loss to know what became of it. It might be on  which requird an answer. As this Letter is wholy on Family buisness I will close it and begin a new one upon politicks when I write again. You tell me you dream of me. I hope they are pleasent drems, for sleeping or waking  I am wholy Yours, "

","My Dearest Friend The heavy rain and thaw  will prevent my getting my Letters to Town to go by the post. To that cause you must attribute it. This Month is a short one, and march will soon be upon you with its new duties, with its load of care, and perplexities. Those of a domestick kind I would relieve you from as much as possible, Yet wish to consult you upon them. In the first place, what is to be done about an House, furniture, Household at  Philadelphia? I do not know the Number which will be requisite. As few as can perform the necessary buisness will be most for our Comfort. In my letter to Brisler I named a Woman here who if she could be had is well calculated for a House keeper both when I am absent and there. Men servants will be best procured at  Philadelphia. Their buisness will be better understood. I feel most anxious for your private Seecratary, who must be trust worthy, close mouthd, a Man of buisness and application. The accomplishments of a drawing Room are not so requisite, as those of the Cabinet, nor do I consider it as any peculiar recommendation that a young Gentleman has been abroad, where he is much more like to acquire habits of dissipation than application. Mr. Pickerings Letter to Mr. Pinckny is just publishing in our papers. I have not been from home to hear the Sentiments of people upon the Subject, but I am  confident it will have a salutary effect upon the minds of those who read it, and open their Eyes with respect to their engagements and attachment to  France. The late victories of their Army in  Italy,tho dearly purchased will give them an other incentive to conquest, and render them still more delirious. There has been much talk here of an Embargo as an necessary measure to preserve our remaining commerce. I asked a Gentleman in the Mercantile Line who was hopeing that Congress would lay an embargo, if the people were not the best Keepers of their own Liberties and priveledges. O no he replid, the Merchants would risk and ruin themselves if not restraind by authority. There is much good Sense in Swanwiches arguments for a direct Tax. A Land Tax will be submitted to in  N England with much less reluctance than the very unpopular ones of Hearth window and Stamps. I am  that so sensible a Man as Mr. Harper should know so little of the temper and disposition of his Countrymen. If there are no extra officers appointed for the collection of a land tax so as to render it burdensome in that way I believe it will be cheerfully paid, and we certainly ought to have some resource of revenue which is not subject to the piratical plunder of Foreign Nations. Mr. Volneys prediction respecting  France will take place sooner or later I have not a doubt, and that it must be Royal Blood to heal their wounds, a successfull General may pave the way but their measure is not yet full. The vials of wrath are not yet all poured out upon the Nations against whom they are contending. I wait for your directions respecting our affairs at Home. The Grass seed you will not fail to send. This Thaw  must extend to your Rivers and open them. Billings has been employd for several days in making a dingy for stones. He has compleated one which he says would make you laugh if you could see it. He is making a New cart putting his Harrow and tools in order. His wanderings have not been very troublesome this winter. Take him at large I do not know a better Hand. He can contrive buisness and sit himself about it. His cattle look well. Baxters sheep have not attempted your Wall, but they leap the other.  Adieu my dear Friend and companion. I dream too of you, but they are not so pleasing as my waking Thoughts, the former being fancifull wandering, the latter possessing the constant & unalterable attachment and affection of your  "

","Captain Beals has just  from  Boston and brought me the inclosed Letter from our son. I send it you tho I hope the same vessel may have brought Letters for you, and dispatches for the Secretary of State. Tho it chiefly relates to domestick occurrences I know it will give you pleasure to read it. Return it when read. I had a few lines from Thomas informing me of his Health, and in his drole Stile Lamenting that poor Whitcomb and he are in the same predicament having by their long absence, Lost their Sweet Hearts, but they comfort themselves by thinking that there will be an ample number of the same comodity on Hand when they return. I received  by post  your Letters of Janry 26  29 and  31 Janry  and one from Brisler, but as I think I fully answerd all his objections in a former Letter I shall omit any thing further untill I see Mrs. Brisler and converse with her. You know my Spirit of accommodation. I would wish as Pope expresses it,  ""to rise with Dignity, and fall with ease.""  Yet not a person whom I have heard speak upon the Subject of  but what expect and think there ought to be an enlargement of it, and a House and furniture provided.

","My Dearest Friend It is now the middle of  It will be the 20 by the Time this reaches you. The whole Months has been a Thaw so that to present appearences we shall have an early Spring. Billings has been several day at work upon the Wall. He tells me he shall want help to cart and digg. Veseys time is just expiring, and as he is a bird of passage he does not incline to tarry longer. So that I have to seek a Hand, and to hire occasionally, for I think this wall which Billings computes at 30 days, ought to be compleated as soon as possible. The Hill must however be ploughd in a week or ten days. Unless the Weather changes it may be done. Write if you are like to send seed. French was with me a day or two since, to know if I had received an answer from you respecting his remaining upon the place. I told him that there was no doubt he might have it. He propos'd breaking up 3 or 4 acres upon Belchers side adjoining to Dr. Phips. He says that will be sufficient, and that the manure will be required upon the Ground which is to be sown so that much corn will not be profitable. I conversd with the Dr. upon the subject. He proposed letting French take the place for two Years as an inducement to him to carry on Manure, but this is as you please. I wish you to make provision in March for the payment of Haydens Note. His Brother  a few days since and ask'd me if I would take it up. I told him I was  not prepaird then, but if he wanted the money I would procure it for him in a few days. He replid that he would not give me the trouble to do that. If his Brother was really in want he would let me know. I then told him I would take it up by the middle of March, but still I would get the Money immediatly if he would send me word. I have not heard  [illegible]   since so presume he will wait till March. My Rates were sent the  [illegible]   first of this Month. They amount to 178 dollors and half the Farm tax upon which French and Vinton owe to 24 dollors, 16 Barrels. They have taken it upon them to Rate your personal estate at 90 dollors. I know of no one article of living which does not exceed in price this year the last; during 8 weeks of as good travelling as ever was known in the winter, there was a plenty, but no glut of the Market or fall of prices. I am disposed with you to curtail every expence which the parsimony of our Rep's require, and I would calculate for a surpluss of Manure too. It will be there Disgrace, not ours, but they will bring their Government into contempt by it. They cry out, the high prices are but temporary, but they will starve out their officers whilst that temporary continues, which has been annually proving worse for these six Years. I have been  diverted with a little occurence which took place a few days since and which serve to shew how little founded in nature the so much boasted principle of Liberty and equality is. Master Heath has opend an Evening School to instruct a Number of Apprentices Lads cyphering at a shilling a week, finding their own wood and candles. James desired that he might go. I told him to go with my compliments to Master Heath and ask him if he would take him. He did and Master Heath  for answer that he would. Accordingly James went. After about a week, Neighbour Faxon came in one Evening and requested to speak to me. His Errant was to inform me that if James went to School, it would break up the School for the other Lads refused to go. Pray Mr. Faxon has the Boy misbehaved? If he has let the Master turn him out of school. O no, there was no complaint of that kind, but they did not chuse to go to School with a Black Boy. And why not object to going to meeting because he does Mr. Faxon? Is there not room enough in the School for him to take his seperate forme? Yes. Did these Lads ever object to James playing for them when at a dance? How can they bear to have a Black in the Room with them there? O it is not I that object, or my Boys. It is some others. Pray who are they? Why did not they come themselves? This Mr. Faxon is attacking the principle of Liberty and equality upon the only Ground upon which it ought to be supported, an equality of Rights. The Boy is a Freeman as much as any of the young Men,  and merely because his Face is Black, is he to be denied instruction? How is he to be qualified to procure a livelihood? Is this the Christian principle of doing to others, as we would have others do to us? O Mam, you are quite right. I hope you wont take any offence. None at all Mr. Faxon, only be so good as to send the young men to me. I think I can convince them that they are wrong. I have not thought it any disgrace to my self to take him into my palourparlour and teach him both to read and write. Tell them Mr. Faxon that I hope we shall all go to Heaven together. Upon which Faxon laugh'd, and thus ended the conversation. I have not heard any more upon the subject. I have sent Prince constantly to the Town School for some time, and have heard no objection. I think you will excuse my attendance at  Philadelphia till October. I hope however you will be able to come on in June. I  with Dr. Tufts on the subject of building a Barn. He says he should advise to Building only a coach House for the present and appropriate the whole of this building for the Hay. He thinks some alteration may take place in the course of an other year which perhaps may render it less expensive. Inclosed is a line which I received from Mr. Bracket a day or two since. I fear your more serious occupations will put out of your mind all personal concerns.  Adieu my dear Friend do not let any thing put out of your Mind your ever affectionate "

","My Dearest Friend It was not till last Evening that I received  Your Letters of  2d. ,  4  and  7th . The post did not get in which was due on Twesday till Saturday. I do not know how to pass a week without hearing from you. I received news papers to the Tenth. In those I have an account of the declaration. It was a solemn scene to you, and an affecting one. You will find by  my Letter of the 8th.  that I was with you. I have not taken any steps as yet  to quitting home. I must tell you a little of Farming if you cannot give me any directions. Billings has tried various kind of work since the weather became milder. He workd two days on the Wall before the House. He then attempted to break up a peice of ground upon the Hill when you directed this. He has accomplishd and carted on the manure. He has since been sleding stones, for we had an other snow which lasted for a few days and assisted us in that Buisness tho it obstructed other. Veseys time expires this week, and buisness will soon press hard, so that I must have a hand immediatly and two in April if Billings goes on with his Walls. French is inclined to stay, but wants some further indulgence, such as a little wood and the use of the cattle wholy to himself except when calld to work upon this place, by which means he could pay  for labour, upon the place. Thinks the hire of a Man and maid will eat him up. Unless he may be thus indulged, he will in consideration of it pay all the shoeing and will get up some seaweed into the pens. I have thought we had better consent to this, as we know the Man, and the trouble of looking out a new Tennant who may want as much, have a larger Family and do us more harm than the amount of these Articles. I shall however consult Dr. Tufts as you direct, and will do the best we can. I shall let him have  Quincy meddow and in lieu, Barrel is to take the whole of the pasture. I have not yet tried Mears as I thought it would be time enough; for I have no disposition to give the management up whilst I remain here. I will enter into a treaty with him to take it in the fall if I can. I  with your Mother upon having a Room to herself without nameing my particular place. She said she should prefer being with her Children, that she would come and stay with me some part of the time whilst I remaind here, and that when I went away I might make provision for her then if she lived. I told her I should be very happy to have her and would make her as comfortable as I could tho it was probable my Family would sometimes be an incumberd one. She has spent one week with me, and when I know how matters are to be arranged I shall have her here again. I can not say any thing with  respect to domestick arrangement at  Philadelphia untill I know what is in the House. I hope still that Congress will consider the subject sufficiently to add what furniture may be necessary. I want not a stick of it at the close of the Term. You must not worry yourself upon that Head. I suppose I can collect domesticks from this way, the Principles ones, but whether I could some in the lower departments I do not know. I mentiond in my Letter to Mr. Brisler a woman as an housekeeper whom I shall try for, but as she is with Jeffry and he is very good to her, and has made her and two grandchildren who are dependent upon her very comfortable I do not know that I shall succeed. The yellow fever has its terrors with many and I do not wonder at it. My dearest Friend as you have been  in providence into the chair of Government, you did not accept it without knowing that it had its torments, its trials, its dangers and perplexities. Look steadfastly at them, arm yourself with patience and forbearence and be not dismayed, and may God and the people support you. Having put your Hand to the plough, you must not look back, nor ought You I think to wish you had not. I presume you will have a splendid . There are preparations making in  Boston to celebrate it. I received a very polite Note inclosing a  Card for me and an other for Louissa for the Washington Ball. The Note from the Managers requested me to honour them with my attendance, which they should esteem a particular favour. As it is the last publick honour they can shew the President, thus circumstanced I have determined to attend. I hope your next Letters will be more explicit, and that you will be able to fix upon some plan. I am my dearest Friend  willing to be a fellow Labourer with you in all those Relations and departments to which my abilities are competent, and I hope to acquire every requisite degree of Taciturnity which my station call for, tho Cabot says truly that it will be putting a force upon nature. I expect many trials when it may be hard work, but as  [illegible]   porcupine says, I shall think. Communicate to me what ever you learn of our dear sons. There we have pleasures which  never knew. One Man ought not to have every thing. Adieu there is one pleasure wanting to me, that of folding to my Bosom the dear partner of all my joys and sorrows and telling him that I am ever his "
"Quincy  March 1 1797
","My Dearest Friend This is the first day of March, and I have no Letters from you of a later date than the  11th of   and then only a few lines. Several things which I have written to upon, and which I wish for directions before I proceeded to execute, are I suppose lost and forgotten by you, in the Multitude of your Thoughts. I must proceed with the advise of Dr. Tufts, for whom I have this day sent, in order to consult with him. Vintons time is near out. There is an apprizement of the Stock which must be made and he allowd for a quarter part of their increased value. A mate is to be procured for the ox we lost. I tell French he ought to buy it, as he expects a further indulgence with the team. He pleads that he is not able. I like French so well and he seems disposed to conduct honorably that I think it had best be done. I believe I wrote you that I had hired a Young Man for a Month, a son of Samll Bracket who went from this Town some Years ago. He is very capable of Buisness but holds himself very high so that I do not expect to agree for more than the present Month. Billings has had an other Caper of a week long. I fear he will not do to hire again after his period expires. He is now comeing out of it. I shall be a better judge of the Qualities of Bracket at the expiration of a Month. He is large and stout, used to a team, of a good stock himself, brought up to labour now, and is now sought after by several persons for the season, but gold may be bought too dear. Prices are not setled untill April and May. I yesterday sent for Mears  and gave him my proposals in writing. The chief objection he offerd was, that being in a setled way of Buisness by which he must get his future living, he should lose his old custom, which would make it difficult for him to obtain it again. To obviate that difficulty I promised to Build him a shop, he to furnish the tools himself, coal and Iron to the halves, and to receive half the profits. In winter he could be pretty constant in it. He has the proposals under consideration, which whether he accepts or not he has promised to keep secret, but I am more and more convinced that he is the only person to put here. We had as I expected a very splendid , an account of which you will see in the paper. His Honours politeness led him to stay untill he had conducted and seated me at the supper table. He however escaped as soon after as he could. I must do the Managers but Justice when I say, I never saw an assembly conducted with so much order, regularity and propriety. I had every reason to be pleased with the marked respect and attention shewn me. Col. Bradford, who is really the Beau Nash of ceremonies even marshalld his company, and like the Garter King at Arms calld them over as they proceeded into the Grand Saloon, hung with the prostrate pride of the Nobility of  France. Swan had furnishd them with a compleat set of Gobelin Tapresty. As the Ladies only could be seated at Table with about 20 or 30 of the principle Gentlemen the rest were requested to retire to the Boxes untill the Ladies had supped, when they left the Table and took their Seats in the Boxes whilst the Gentlemen suped. All was order and decency. About half after one, the company returnd to the Ball Room, and I retired with those who accompanied me to the Ball. Most of the rest of  company remaind until 4 oclock. Neither the Govenour or Lady or Mrs. Gill were present. The only person who shewd that they felt mortified and placed in the back ground was Mrs. Scott. How could she expect any thing else? The seat assignd to the Lady of the President Elect was Hung with Gobeline Tapestry, and in the center of the Room, conspicuous only for the hanging. On my Right the Manager placed the Lady of Judge Lowel, and on my Left the Lady of Judge Sumner. Judge Dana, but not his Lady was present. When I was conducted into the Ball Room the Band were orderd to play the President March. The Toast men only 6 in Number. I presume you will see them in the paper. Have the Philadelphians behaved as well? Every toast save one made the Saloon resound with an universal Clap and a united Huza. That was the vice president Elect. I was sorry it was so cold and faint. The Scripture assures us that it is better to go to the House of mourning than the House of Feasting. Previous to my attendance at the Ball Room I  the last office of respect to the remains of your Aunt Vesey, by following her to the Grave. I received notice of her death but the day before. I considerd this as a duty which I owed to your Mother, and I found it a very acceptable notice to the Relatives. At six oclock I returnd to Mr. Smiths, and prepaird for a different Scene, not without reflections upon the visisitudes of Life. I see by the paper your address of leave to the Senate. I do not wonder that you was affected upon the occasion. The Chronical, I am told, assures all good Republicans that they ought to rejoice in your Election, first because you was opposed to the British Treaty.  because you are not  Enimical to  France. 3d because you are no party Man and will have an oppinion of your own. fourthly because Hamilton secretly opposed your Election. and 5ly because you and the Vice President will harmonize. Wonderfull discoveries! and much of a peice with all their late publications. I see there has been an arrival at  N York from  Amsterdam. I hope dispatches from our sons have arrived. Present me kindly to the Vice President when he arrives, and if you think it will do, tell him I am glad that he is your successor. I shall now take my leave of the Vice President and address my next Letters to the President, whom neither Rank or Station can more  permantently fix in the Heart of His  ever affectionate "

","My Dearest Friend Since I wrote you by the last post I have received  yours of 16  &  20th , which answers some of my questions respecting our  affairs. I have just written to Brisler, who by what I can find by her, seems to be balancing in his own mind what to do? He is as necessary to our Household as a vice president to the Senate. I do not know what ought to be given him, nor do I know what are the common wages of domesticks there. I presume not higher than they ask here, for they are very extravagant. I cannot say to you any thing with respect to arrangments, as I do not learn what has been done. This day we have a Hurricane of a wind and as cold as   Boston has sufferd by fire twice within a fortnight. 3 Roap walks and 3 or four dwelling houses were burnt when I was in Town, and on Sunday morning the Barns and stables of Deacon Phillips with a dwelling house, in which Mr. Turner the dancing master lived were consumed. I received with your last Letters one from Mrs. Washington, and the one to you, from the  which I value very highly as a testimony to the worth and services of our dean Son, and from him whom I cannot suspect of flattery. When you write to me, or to others omit the word Free and only put . This was the custom of the President, and do not leave any of my Letters in the way of your  secretary. I have written our Sons by way of  England. Are there any Letters from them?  "
"Quincy  March 12th 1797
","My Dearest Friend After a week of anxious expectation, I received by last Thursdays post, a packet containing three , a pamphlet, two excellent Letters from our dear Sons, and fourteen lines from a hand, from which I was desirious of receiving, fourteen times as much. Unreasonable do you exclaim! Publick Buisness, publick cares, allow'd, but there is a kind of communication and intercourse which is a relieaf to the burdend mind, at least I conceive so. I have read the address, the answer, and the reply. Upon reading the first period in the address, it struck me as obscure  to the length of the period. I read it a second time. The Sense was clear but some how, it did not Seem what I wanted to have it; I attempted to, throw the Ideas into an other form, but could not Succeed, without weakening the force of expression or greatly lengthing the address. I therefore concluded that you had labourd yourself under the same difficulty. I made no remark upon it, but in my own mind, Three persons have since mentiond to me, the same thing, and one of them told me that he had himself been trying to place the Ideas of the first period in shorter Sentances, but met with the very obstical which I had myself before experienced. The address brought into view a Number of home Truths. Evident to Some, unseen by others. As the Sentiments of the writer are known to me, I trace their meaning, end and aim, and pronounce them all wise, just, and Good. The reply answer of the Senate is Manly, dignified, affectionate and cordial. The Reply will tend to strengthen the bond of union. The whole is calculated to remove the film from the Eyes of those who are disposed to see. I have heard  but one remark, and that was from Jarvis. He was glad to see you come out so fully and declare that the Senate were equal to the defence and preservation of the constitution, and that it needed not a more permanent counsel. With mischievious men, no honest man would hold communion: but with Men who have been mislead, and who possess integrity of Heart, every good Man would be desirious of standing fair. To the latter the conduct of H  n has been misterious, and they are ready to think that the President is a more impartial Man than they were taught to believe, and that the opposition and Secret machinations and intrigues of a certain Character arose altogether from knowing that the Man whom a majority of the people wishd to succeed the President was too independent in his Sentiments to receive controul. They conclude that they have been mistaken in him. I see by the paper received last Evening that the Senate are notified to convene, by which I judge there are Subjects of  to be imparted. Are there any official accounts of the reception of Pinckny by the Directory? Such reports are in circulation. I am pleasd to find Mr. Murray appointed as the successor of our Son. I do not know where a properer person could have been found. Russel the printer is an abominable Blunderer; he is not fit to publish State papers. No less than three blunders has he made in publishing the address to the Senate and in the Reply to their answer as you will see by reading it. My mind has ever been interested in publick affairs. I now find, that my Heart and Soul are, for all that I hold dearest on Earth is embarked on the wide ocean, and in a hazardous voyage. May the experience, wisdom and prudence of the helmsman  conduct the vessel in Safety.  I am as ever a fellow passenger.  "

","My Dearest Friend Dr. Tufts has been consulted by me respecting the  our places, and we have come to an agrement with the Tennants, who in proportion to the rise of Labour and produce, Annually expect more and more indulgences. A Farmer can not be content with the profits he once made. He will tell you, the day Labourer fares better, which is true. I meet with so many difficulties that I wish sometimes that we had not but one Farm. Dr. Tufts thinks it would be better for your interest, under certain restrictions to lease out the places for a Sum of Money, but this is for future consideration. Barrel I have agreed to find him a Yoke oxen and Cart, he to keep the be at the expence of keeping them in order. French I have agreed to find a mate for his Steer. His Father has one of the Same Age, for which he asks 35 dollors. This being agreed to, the next thing was wood, to be found all their wood. This I absolutely refused, and we came very near parting upon the Subject. After much conversation, Dr. Tufts advised to Stipulating a certain Sum to be allowd for wood. I can only say I have done the best I could. Trask wants employ. Dr. Tufts says that the Bushes behind Belchers House wants clearing up in the medow and Barrel says those in Curtis pasture which our people cut two years ago want again to be attended to. The Spring is advancing but the month of March has been one cold Bluster as yet and greatly impeeds our advance in buisness, which will  occasion a press of Buisness Soon. I have several matters which I should wish to do as soon as it will answer. Among the number is painting the House and Fence, and finishing the Chamber in the out House. We shall want it much when you return for the additional Servants you will bring with you. I have many more things to say but will not at present take up more of your Time.  "

","my Dearest Friend I received by the post  Yours of March   and  5th . I had previously received the speach which I think well calculated to do great Good. I am much out of the way of hearing the observations which will be made upon it. as it is a publication to the people, of your real sentiments & opinions I hope it will be considerd and believed as such, and have a tendency to remove prejudices. I do not wonder at your sleepless Night. the bare reading the speach interested my feelings so much as to have a similar effect upon me. the Idea of a So sacred and solemn a transaction could not fail to impress Your mind with anxious solisitude. I think Gen'll. Washington judged right in giving weight to the solemnity by his presence it will not fail to add Luster to the transaction in the Eyes of all Foreign Nations and be honorable to his successor—the vice Presidents speach will have a favourable Effect, and confirm the opinion which I have ever had of him, in spight of the virulence of party, which is at present Dorment. all parties Said mrs Black who had been sometime in  Boston, appear to be pleasd and happy with the Election. not a single person have I heard express a sentiment to the contrary. I was pleasd with a Toast drunk by Some Scholars at  Cambridge. Adams & Jefferson  or Checks and balances. I do not recollect that I  my gratification satisfaction before at the appointment of mr Murray. I was pleasd with it. Will the present Minister be allowd to leave  the Hague before his successor arrives? as to  arrangments I am not fearfull to trust them to Brisler—he must do as well as he can with respect to Female help. When the Time approaches for my going I will advertize for such as I want I should chuse not to send any from hence, untill I go; unless it may be thought best that mrs Brisler should go on soon as we cannot entertain Company half so often as the late President. I should hope not to want so numerous a Household, and be relieved in some measure from a weight of care and torment I will however neveer relinquish my Right of direction & controul over the Household, to no steward or Housekeeper. I believe half the torment experienced, was oweing to that cause—in Brisler we know we have the Man of Honour and integrity. there was due to Brisler on the 15 of Febry 30 pound which You will pay him, as I presume his Family will want it, and I wish you to give him a decent suit of Cloaths as a token of his Faithfull services— Brisler had better make out a List of the furniture in the House, such as he thinks will do to remain. I suppose Family  must be purchased immediatly. I would advise not to procure more than for  immediate necessity, you know by your former experience how handy those articles are for transportation. Mrs otis was kind enough to offer her assistance. she is a good judge & Brisler had better consult her: I can give better advise as soon as I have knowledge of what is left. I hope you will not remain in  Philadelphia any longer than absolute necessity requires I Shall fear much for your Health. Your Farm will suffer in your absence, but that you expect. I find I want more help. Billings persues his Wall, but there is an immensity of Stones to cast off of this Hill. they have been at it, for a week. I made James assist, but he met with an accident & scald both his feet, and poor Becky had her share by the fall of a boiling teakettle of water, so that they are both useless now, and will be for a long time. I shall persue buisness with spirit and courage as soon as I have the means—at present I live upon credit. Thayer has purchased of Fogg and is building a wall with fence of two rails in order to keep sheep. Burrel says we shall be devourd if we do not do the same. this will be another peice of Buisness for Billings—and we have not posts. shall red ceadars be cut for the purpose? I shall be anxious to hear again from you, and let me know how you are. march has been a trying month to me. I have combatted hard not to be laid up. Poor Mary Smith Louissa Sister is far gone in a consumption. we have very little hopes of her recovery. Mrs Brisler and Family are well So constant and frequent are the Captures, that there is little hope of the safe conveyance of Letters abroad. plunder seems the only rule of conduct, which our Allies practise. I shall be happy not to be obliged to come on  you find it necessary to return to  Philadelphia. it would be an expence; and I would avoid every unnecessary expence, for I could not use the horses which I have, nor travel without four if I used the Coach Mr smith was advising me the other Day to get the bright marks colour &c of your Horses and Wood of  Charlstown who buys many horses. would be like to procure a pr at a much more reasonable rate than can be bought at the Southard.

","My Dearest Friend I received by this days post  your Letters of the 9th. ,  11th. , and  13th . That of the  15th . I hoped would have  a post Note that my word which I had given for the payment of Haydens Note, and to the collecters of Taxes might not be forfeited. Yesterday the collector calld upon me for the 2d Time. I told him I could not pay him, but that I would in the course of the Month, relying upon the post of this day. He observed if I could not pay, who could? I told him I had not the money. I could have added that I had but one solitary 5 dollors bill in at my command. I get Letters only once a week from you. The various dates then come together. Perhaps you do not send them to the office as you write them. Concequently I cannot receive any thing further until the 30th. which will be next Thursday. That my word may be stricktly kept, I must have recourse to our old Friend the Genll. for the sum which I have to pay, is the Note to Hayden which is 100.6 dollors or near it, and 200 hundred faxes, 178 dollor 20 cents, for the tax Bill presented me, 25 as half taxes to the other place and 8 as half of Barrels. I have a kind Man whose time will expire on the 30th. I have to pay for an ox bought of for French 35 dollors. I have to hire day Labour as an assistant to Bracket, in plowing and tending manure.  Billings is wholy occupied with the Wall, and there he had better be kept. There is a peice against Deacon Bass to be made next, then against Jonathan Bass and against Bracket replaceing old walls &c. As usual a multiplicity of Buisness comes on and many hands are wanted at once. That time which waits for none may be lost. The seed is arrived. I will make inquiry about the oats. I have endeavourd to be as frugal as I could of the money remitted, and in one instance only, have afforded myself an indulgence at the expence of 30 dollors which was for a pr. Runners, that I might not be wholy indebted to my Neighbours for conveyance even to meeting. 30 is paid to Mr. Bass for keeping the cattle at the Island, 30 I paid to Vesey for 3 months labour, and 25 to Billings. Some of the retaining Sum was necessarily expended for shoes, cloathing for my Boys and girls, and a little very little for myself. Family expences in the course of 3 months have brought me some in debt, every article having risen instead of falling. I can give you no satisfaction with respect to Mears. He had my proposals in writing. He  them for a month, and then came and told me that my offers were generous were satisfactory, but he should have a responsibility upon him that he feard to engage in, that he should lose his custom which must finally be his living, that now when his day labour was performd, he had no care no anxiety, but should he take such a charge upon him, he should not enjoy an hours comfort. He should be always in fear of not doing right. He ownd he could not clear the sum I offerd,  begd me to excuse him, tho it paind him to refuse. He had not an alteration that he could have wisht me to have made. He promised to keep the whole Secret, but where I am now to look or what next to do I can not tell. I know not of any other person who could be equally confided in. I must finish off the out house and marry up Polly, and let her and Jonathan go in this winter I believe and take charge of the place till an other Season. To quit here in October, will have considerable buisness remaining to be done. I see not what else is to be done. Better I do not know that the Man has any faculty but for shoe making: but we must consider of this subject. Perplexitys surround me which ever way I look. I know you feel the want of your usual  amusement and relaxation. I hope you will not suffer in concequence of it. I feel too, as if we ought not to be so seperated. I want to talk with, and to you of a thousand things which should not be committed to paper, but I will close this as it relates wholy to our own domestick matters and begin an other sheet upon other Subjects.

","My Dearest Friend I have neither seen or heard of any  remarks or strictures upon your late addresses. What may be reservd for hereafter I know not. The Chronical has been quite favourable, drawing however wrong inferences that your administration would be very different from your predecessors. The impression made upon the minds of the publick as far as I can learn them, have been highly favourable, but the publick have exhausted themselves upon your predecessor. They must take breath, and recollect themselves, before they can bestow even merrited praise. Our good Brother Cranch said he was enraptured with the Speach, that he had read it repeatedly, and every time with new delight and pleasure. Mr. Flint who lately attended the ordination of Mr. Peirce at  Brookline, reported that it was held in high estimation. I saw a proposal in Websters paper, of having it printed and Framed with the late Presidents. The solemnity of the Scene in which you was the principle actor, the dignified Speach deliverd previous to the oath of office, the presence of the Great Friend and Father of his Country who presented himself to the publick as a pledge for his Successor, could not fail to inspire into the minds and Hearts of all present, the strongest Emotions of tenderness, nor do I wonder that it found its way to their Eyes. There are many other reflection which would have penetrated my Heart upon the occasion. I cannot consider the event in the light which a Lady of our acquaintance describes it,  ""a Game of chance, the highest  Card in the pack, a second throw could make no addition but a Crown,"" Promotion cometh neither from the East nor from the west nor from the South, but God is the judge, saith the Scripture. I  you the Letter and my reply. When I was at  Plimouth a number of them were purchasing tickets, and invited me to join them. I bought one with them. This will explain the first part of the Letter. The feelings, and Spirit are endeavourd to be conceald under the appearence of Friendship. and may be I hope the professions are sincere, tho there is a manifest design to lead me to consider the Event as Chance, rather than choice. The Idea of great Wealth held up, so that the Chance of 5 thousanddollors or Eight shillings could be no object with me, is a reflection not justified, and this she knew. You observe that the News is . I presume you mean as it respects Mr. Pinkny but this does not appear to be well founded. Or do you mean, as it respects Peace? I do not think it improbable that Pinckny may be refused, considering what are the designs of the directory, but as you once observed in a Letter to a Friend in the Year 1782 That your whole Life from Infancy, had been passed through an uninterrupted Series of delicate Situations, so when you found yourself suddenly translated into a New one, the view of it, neither confounded or dismayed you. I hope you will continue to possess the same fortitude, and , for where there is neither fixed principles nor any Laws Humane or divine, which are considerd binding, it puzzels all calculation to know what part to act. I read the Letter of Mifflin and your reply. I should not have  you to have accepted the House on any terms. I have not got my last papers so do not know what they  have done with the House. There is one observation in your Letter which struck me as meaning more than is . J. is as he was! Can he still be a devotee to a cause and to a people, run mad, without, any wish for Peace, without any desire after a rational system of Government, and whose thirst for power and absolute dominion is become Gluttonous? can it be? I regret that Dr. Prietly has been left to the commission of such an error of Judgment as to be present at the Feast of as porcupine call them. He has laid himself open to the Scourge, and Peter lays it on with exultation. He has given him a handle and the Friends of the Doctor, must censure. He ought not to have had any Hand or part in the buisness. Poor  [illegible]  McKean. He has made him aHenpeck indeed. How the truth cuts. I wonder Peter does not get broken bones. Poor  Pennsilvania keeps no gallows, but she keeps Rogues and villans who deserve one, and she will find to her cost that she has not reachd the MillinaumMillenium. I know when you get to Housekeeping you will pine for Society, for your Farm, For your Wall, and wish as Boylestone Adams says that it was the end of the fourth, instead of the beginning Year. Please to tell Brisler that his wife looks quite sober and sad that she has not had a Letter from him for a month. The man imitates his master, and has written so frequently to his wife of late, that she, like her mistress feels mortified whenever a  prevents her from receiving assurences of unabating Love and affection, which tho a thousand times told, will never diminish of their value in the estimation of  Your  who is here desires me to give her Love to you. She has past through this cold Winter better than I expected. Mrs. Temple just passing by reminds me of a saucy old poet who says,  "" [Frailty?], thy name, is woman."" Could Mr. Russel look from his happy abode, what would he say to see his property flying into the hands of a young British officer whose commission of  [Leiut.?] is all the wealth he owns. His wife, [azn?]. she ought never to have been his, and I know not but Mr. Russel was as indiscreat at 55 as she has been at 29. All the contrivance of that old Sinner his Father. Let every man enjoy his property as he passes through Life. Do with it all the good he can and not leave it to be disposed of at his discease. By he knows not whom. "

","My Dearest Friend I received the  Letters to day after having been myself a borrower of Genll. Lincoln of three Hundred Dollors which I expect to pay away tomorrow, having waited untill the last day when I could expect a remittance which would enable me to fulfill my Word. I also  my answers to the Letters. I wish I could have complied with the request. I was going to  Weymouth, and met Dr. Briggs on the road who deliverd me the Letters, who told me he had the securities ready  [illegible]   drawn with him. He intimated that if you would give any incouragement to let him have the money in the course of a month, that it would do. I told him I could not make any engagement, nor could I say a word by way of encouragement. I could only say that I would agreable to request inclose the Letter. I have felt very anxious about your cold. I wish you to get a portion of Rhubarb and calomel, and take. If you was to repeat it, in the course of 5 or 6 days it would be of service to you at this season of the year, when you usually require some medicine of that kind, and the more so as you will not so early get your annual ride and which  grevious for the time, was never the less salutary. My man whom I valued so highly is bid out  of my Hands both by John Newcomb and William Baxter. They have both bid upon each other, till they have mounted up to 20 Dollors pr. Month for him for 8 months. I offerd him more than I dare tell, and risk'd hireing him a Year. They want him to follow the market, of which he is very capable. I could not think of giving him such a price for Farming, and so he goes the first of April from me, and I have again to seek a hand. Adets visit to the  has reachd  Boston and conjectures, and speculations, what might be the purport of it, are Numerous. He could not go in a publick Character, his functions having been suspended. Beside had he communications, they must go through the Secretary of State. As a private Man he cannot transact publick buisness. What would I give to sit down alone with you, and converse some hours. I want to see you; daily,  and a beor hear from you. If you were to send your Letters to the post office on post days, as they were written I think I should hear from you oftner than once a week. I do not know where they stop, as I sometimes get the  Quincy mail on other days than Thursday,  but seldom or ever find it to contain a Letter for your affectionate  "

","My Dearest Friend With my borrowed money I have just paid the collector my last Bill. I have the satisfaction to know that I did not borrow it to pay any  of my own creating, but having been twice before call'd upon, I could not submit to a third, without discharging it. I have not any Letter from you of a later date than the  17th  nor do I expect to get an other untill the 4th. of April. The weather is exceeding cold and sour. Our dreadfull east winds prevail and peirce one through and through. I have not been confined, but fear every day least I should. We are all in affliction. Polly Smith is just gone. I do not expect she will continue an other week. Her decline has been rapid, about two months since she was first confind. My spirits are low. I want some thing to Cheer them up. I think you are fastned to a spot which you cannot leave at Will, and I believe you want your Family more than when you was occupied by a daily attendance in Congress. Your mind is however so fully employd that you can not think much of it. We are suffering under the same apprehensions which have afflicted other places. The attempts to destroy  Boston by fire are daily, or rather Nightly repeated. Patroles are constantly kept. They have detected but few. The vile wretches have got into the Country. At  Milton they keep a Nightly watch. It is really a distressing calamity, but we shall be infested with more vagabonds, if the states go on to abolish capital punishment. You write me that you shall not procure any furniture  I come, but if it is to be made, it will require time. I have written to Mrs. Otis to request her to go through the House with Brisler after you get into it, and to tell me what she thinks will be necessary. When an inventory is taken of what is in the House, I can judge better. I have not heard of the oats. I have got Mr. Smith to inquire. Billings is at work upon the wall. It takes an immence number of stones. Our people have been several days carting them. It is so very wet that they have only been able to plow a part of the ground before the House. The medow below the House is flow'd and the Brooks are very high. We have floods of Rain every day or two. The manure has all been pitch'd over, some of it carted out. Our people say there are two hundred load of it. The season is backward. When a fair day comes I am obliged to hire three or four hands to get any thing forward, and after all your Eye is wanted, and your direction too. I cannot mount on . I can only direct. I mourn the loss of a man who had zeal in his nature, and activity in his bones, as well as strength of Body, and was not a rum drinker. He however tells me that he will let himself to me an other year if I should want him. Money will be of more value I trust. There is complaint of a scarcity of it, yet every thing is high, but Grain which is much lower. Corn may be had at a dollor, Rye & 6.8, flower 10 dollors and half. Provision is yet very high, West India produce also.  "

","    My Dearest Friend My Dearest Friend The proclamation of the 25 of March which is published in the Centinal of April 1st. has excited many anxious thoughts in my Mind. What would I give for an hours conversation? It would tend to alleviate my apprehensions. I feel as if I could fly in all our many . I have experienced a variety of anxieties. I thought there could be nothing New to feel, but there is now Such a responsibility annexed to your Station, that New and various thoughts arise hourly in my mind, when I contemplate what may arise be the concequence of such, and such, measures, How the Senate, how the House will conduct, how the people will act, How Foreign Nations will be affected in this dark abyss my imagination wanders, without any one to converse with, who can at all enlighten me. I agree with you that there has been an uncommon silence respecting the late address. The Breath of praise was exhausted, the address was acceptable to every one as I have been told, and has had a very salutary effect upon many who had been misled,  well meaning. As Genll. Lincoln assured me, no one has assaild it, but the time is fast approaching when the measures of the Government cannot be looked upon with an Eye of indifference. We shall either be a united people, more strongly bound by common danger, or we shall become a prey to foreign influence.  The people will judge right, if they are left to act for themselves. It is well to observe, to watch and to attend to concequences. In the present state of things, it is almost difficult to conjecture what a day may bring forth, much less can we see to the end of a Year. The ambition of individuals, and their Envy will no doubt  in proportion to the good or ill success, of the Administration. That you may be supported through the Arduous and important trials,  is the constant and fervent prayer of your   "

"," My Dearest Friend My Dearest Friend I received an hour ago  your Letters of the 22d.  and  27th . I have been anxious enough for you since I saw the proclamation. I advised you to take for your cough Rhubarb and . Do not omit it, but take it immediatly. It will serve you for the complaint which usually afflicts you in the spring as well as for your cough. I will obey the Summons as soon as possible but there are many arrangements to make, or deliver all up to destruction, at once. I shall endeavour to send Mrs. Brisler on first by the Stage with her Children. I will see her tomorrow, and consult with her about it. I must find a Family which I can place here. I expected you would find every thing in disorder in the House  not so bad as you represent. I have as I wrote you had three hundred Dollors of Genll. Lincoln for the purchasespurpose mentiond, and one Hundred more I was obliged to take, to enable me to pay my Labourers as I went on. O I had got a going so cleverly. Billings will compleat his circle of Wall in two days more, and it is a Beauty, Shuts us in the Garden, and Tirril and Bracket have been carting manure and plowing. I had employd Pratt  to compleat and finish a cart begun by Billings. It is done and painted. I had got new ploughs and tools, and a Man to come next week for the season. I expected to have got all things in order for your reception when you should be able to return to the domestick joys of  peace Feild. All these pleasing Ideas must  to new arrangements. I will do the best I can and come as soon as I can. I write this now only to assure you that I shall tomorrow take some measures for executing the System proposed. I hope to get this Letter in early enough for the post. I have been in Bed it is true but the multitude of my Thoughts have  me but a small portion of Sleep. I am determined to feel as little despondency as possible. The Situation of poor Mary Smith dejects all our Spirits. I do not know by your Letter whether to send on all my domesticks or whether I may hope to return in the Summer. This is a very incoherent jumble. I will write again when my thoughts are more collected. Two days past have been very oppressive with heat. I am told that most minds are prepared for any measure  with the honour and dignity of the Country, that they have not a mind like Asses to crunch beneath two burdens.  "
"Quincy  April 9th. 1797
","   My Dearest Friend My Dearest Friend I sent last Evening to the post office in hopes that I might, get a Letter of a late date. I received my  to the 30th March, but no Letter. If there is any delay on my part in executing your directions, attribute it solely to the post offices, which will not permit me to receive Letters but once a week from you. I should suppose that if a Mail containd only one Letter, it ought to be sent on, but I have known a  Quincy mail arrive on a Saturday with letters for others whilst those for me tho of various dates, are detaind to be sent all together, and so Careless are they that in the mail before last a Letter to Charles from you, was put in the  Quincy Mail, and returnd by Mr. Hastings to  N York as he informd me. That I have my perplexities in the  of my affairs here you will not doubt. I shall not however trouble you with them. I will surmount those which are to be conquerd, and submit to those which are not. Amongst the latter is Mrs. Brislers declining to go either before me, or with me without her Husbands comeing for her. Now as I do not expect to be so honourd, or indulged, by mine, I shall exert myself to get to him, as soon as possible. She is a poor feeble thing, and never was calld upon for any exertion of any kind, without having him to lean upon. I told her he would not be able to come for her untill the Fall of the Year, and she seemd rather inclined to  remain here untill then. I shall take with me Betsy Howard, Becky and Betsy. I must leave to come by water when they can be accommodated, for one of my inevitables is, that Becky has not walkd or scarcly put her foot upon the ground for a week oweing to an absess which appears to be forming upon the joint of her knee. Thanks to Heaven, my Health is such as enables me to exert myself,  I have my sick days. They have not been lasting and I have not been confind to my Chamber. I am in treaty with Porter whom I expect to place here with his wife and a Girl of ten Years of Age whom she has taken. No Children, no , and I believe an honest Man. I shall hire a man with him. Much must be left to his honour and integrity as I have agreed to find him and his Family in every article except West India, to keep three Cows, 2 yoke oxen, one Horse. Mrs. Farmer I have let French take. She will soon increase. Anthony I shall leave here; Ceasar will come on, and Cleopatra I must dispose of it I can, as she is not like to increase. I shall engage Horses and driver to carry me as far as  N York. I do not see why your Horses and  may not come on for me there. I will give you information in Season and you may convey word to Charles if it should not be in Time for me here. You may write me however for I fear I cannot get our things so as leave them, in less than a fort night. Porter has a little place which he has bought, to let out before I can receive his answer   and you will note this is only the 3 day since I received your Letter of call. I have no Brisler to assist me, nor any person to think or arrange for me further than hand Labour will go, and there is much of that to be done which requires my oversight and direction. I sent for Dr. Tufts, and made my objects known to him, and to him I have told French, Barrel and Porter, they must apply, and Porter that he will receive from you or me directions for his future conduct. There is something to be done for my Mother. A Maid is engaged, which I have promised to pay, and in some other things I should be glad to leave her comfortable and respectable. I have thoughts to get your Brother to Board Billings  his Time is out and let him keep at the Walls, unless in Hay time. I am very anxious for your Cough and pray you to take advise about it. I read  two Letter in Fennos prayer of Decbr. 23 and 30th. I cannot mistake the writer. Mr. Smith informs me that he saw a captain of a vessel from Msterdam, who saw our children in  They were well. He brought no Letters. I have a Letter from  England of the 10 Febry. from Mrs. Copley, in which she requests me to accept the united congratulations of their Family upon the wisdom of our Country Men (considering herself still as an American) in the choice of their first Majestrate. That it not only afforded pleasure to all your particular Friends, but  [illegible]   also to very many people of that Country. [Endorsement -- see page image] By this you see the choice was considerd as certain in that Country as early as Febry. I have a Letter from  Plimouth, containing sentiments of Truth, and from no inaccurate an observer.  Mr. Adams has  on his dignified station at a period when the greatest ability and perspicuity, the clearest understanding, and the most incorruptable virtue is necessary to guide the helm and conduct the political Bark in safety between  Scilly and Charibdes. God Grant he may be an instrument in the Hands of Providence to preserve the United States from War, or from slavery. I wish I could add with a rational hope, from venality and vice. Expectation is awake among all parties. Among the Rivals of his Fame Emulation is on tip-toe. Participation and affection accompany the wishes of his Friends, and his Enemies lie in wait, for reasons to justify disapprobation. This is the World. This your Friend knew without my description. He knows also, or ought to know that he has Friends at  Plimouth who wish his administration may be productive of Glory, Safety, and happiness both to himself and Country."" The whole Letter is written much more in the  of an old Friend than the former one and without that Spice of levity which Seasond the other. The manner of it is,  ""I stand corrected."" This is Sunday. It will be Thursday before I shall again hear from You. Heaven preserve, support and sustain you. "

I will make all the dispatch I can, but I find no body to act for me. Mears and his wife will have any thing to do with the place. I have no body but Billings who can Execute when directed but he is not for you, what he was for Beals, tho as good as any Body I can find. I have hired a young man for one Month, but raw new Hands are not like those who are accustomed to Buisness. Mr. Smith has engaged me 4 horses and a Good Driver, but He could not get him under two Hundred  to carry me to  New York. There I should suppose you might send on your Horses for me. I will give you information when I shall sit of. I am to receive my answer from Porter to day. If he fails me, I will order a vendue and sell off every thing and Let the place as I can to any Body who will take it. It seems as if all our own interest must be sacrificed. I have thought that it would be a good opportunity to send by Mr. Murray the  I have inclosed them to you. You will write; I will if I can get time but I am so presst, I know not which way to turn.

The weather has been as uncommonly cold and Stormy for the week just past as it was Hot for two days the week before. We have a snow storm, of some inches depth, which has lain for three days. It has retarded our Buisness on the farm and chilld our exertions. The sudden changes have confind Your mother and brought on one of her old Lung complaints. The good old Lady is sure she shall dye now her physician and Nurse is about to leave her, but she judges with me, that all ought to be forsaken for the Husband. It is an additional care and anxiety for me. I shall provide for her comfort every thing necessary before I leave her. Mary Smith is yet living. Of how uncertain a duration are all our worldly possessions and Earthly comforts? If we could not look for brighter Scenes and fairer prospects, who could wish to remain the victims of pain and sorrow? Mr. Otis has lost his son George with a dropsy in his Head. I have just been reading Chief Justice Elsworths Charge to the Grand jury at  New York! Did the good gentleman never write before? Can it be genuine?  The language is stiffer than his person. I find it difficult to pick out his meaning in many sentences. I am sorry it was ever publishd. How I run on. The Federilist say there is but one blot in your Character. The Chronical has undertaken to praise and the Jacobins to speak well. The Snare will not hold. Action will soon break it. Critical are the Times. May you get valiently through them.   "

I rejoiced in your rapid progress as the weather was so fine but I  for Mrs. Smith who I knew was following you with all speed, but I fear from your rapid movement did not overtake you untill last night, if then, by a Letter which came yesterday to her from her Sister Clarkson which I ventured to open: I am sure she judged right in going on, tho it leaves me more lonely than I could wish. I could not have enjoyd her company whilst she apprehend any censure could fall upon her; her Struggle was hard between her two duties. I decided for her. I knew for her peace of mind,tho she earnestly desired to remain with me. I shall want to hear when and where she overtook you. I have written you twice, and addrest my Letters to  N York to the care of Charles, hoping you would Get them when you reachd that city. My Health is much as it was the third day. I have the intermitting and a sleepless night but I get two Nights of pretty good Sleep. I must find out something if I can to rid me of so troublesome a companion, for it destroys in one night all I acquire  of Health and Strength the preceeding ones, and it cramps and dejects my Spirits in a very great degree. I however strive to throw it of and engage in the Family affairs so as to amuse my mind, yet melancholy thoughts will frequently get the better of me. I hope however to reconcile myself to the Solitary lot of absence better in a few weeks than at present. Cousin Betsy was married here on Thursday, and went to  Boston the next morning to Housekeeping. I did not mention it to you before you went away least you should think I should make some exertion and injure my Health, but I did not. We had only a small Number of the nearest , and I stayd in my chamber untill after Tea and retired to it again soon after they were married. Mr. Foster being one of Dr. [No transcription available -- see page image]parisioners he ventured to marry him, tho out of his own Limits and Sister Peabody was desirious of seeing her married before she returnd home. They both left me on Friday morning, and here sit Louissa and I looking at each other, and now and then wishing for little Caroline to enliven the Scene. Our pleasure was much alloyd by the Sickness of Brother Cranch and the concequent absence both of him and Sister Cranch. Mrs. Tufts was the only lively Spirit with us. Mrs. Peabody was at Grenoughs, and he lamented very much that you had gone without his seeing you again as he thought he could have  you much easier after trial. He expected you would have call'd again upon him. Say'd that he was not able to do so well as he should have been, if he had not been so afflicted with his Eyes. I am affraid you must have sufferd an inconvenience from the motion of the carriage as you was not sufficiently [No transcription available -- see page image] Mr. Porter will attend to your orders as soon as possible but the vessel with the Lumber is just arrived and must be attended to directly.

Washington with thanks for his and Mrs. Washingtons kind wishes as  in his Letter to you.  "

","My dearest Friend On Sunday, Monday and  we had a storm of Rain, Hail and Snow as severe as we usually get in Jan'ry or Feb'ry attended with a voilent gale of wind. I could not form an Idea where you were, but thought from your rapid movement early in the week that you might have got as far as  Norwalk. My last Letter from you was dated at  Suffield. I have not heard a word from Mrs. Smith since she left Boston. I regret that she did not sit out with you, when she might have gone so conveniently and without the expence which she must be at, but all was intended for the best. I hope she overtook you. I have the pleasure to inform you that I have  this severe winter weather for it freezes now in the House, better than I feard and have slept pretty well for four nights successfully without a wakeing one. My Spirits and Health mend. In concequence I am able to attend to my Family more than I have done since my return, tho not without the constant admonition of Louissa. Aunt you will get cold. I have been out to ride but once since you left me; The vessel with our Lumber is not yet got round. It must go they say to Brackets  [ . . . ] . The late Storm has been very unfavourable  towards us, and will impeed our progress in getting Home the Lumber. Winter put on an early and formidable appearence. I hope good will arrise from it and that it will effectually stay the plague in our cities. I have not yet heard a word from Brisler or Family. I  to you at  Phyladelphia where I hope you will be safely arrived. I inclose some Letters received since you went a way and will thank you to Frank the inclosed to Charles. Mr. Cranch is something better  so low as to keep his Bed and to have watchers constantly. I have not seen my sister since you left me here. I hope to hear from you frequently as a solace to me. I am as ever your affectionate   "

","My dearest Friend You have been so good writing at every Stage when you put up for the night, that I have been able to follow you with pretty exact calculation. I thought however that Mrs. Smith would overtake you at  New Haven. I received yesterday  your Letter from Lovejoys and was rejoiced to find that Mrs. Smith had come up with you, more so, as the unpleasent weather must have retarded you on your journey, if it was half as bad with you as here; I took a ride in the Sleigh yesterday afternoon towards  Milton. The whole Earth looks like mid winter, and the Snow is 4 and 5 foot deep, in Banks driven together and consoladated so that it will lie at the Sides of the Road till next March or April. At  Plimouth and  Hingham there was very little, not much at  Weymouth but the nearer you advance towards  Boston the deeper it is. If it had fallen level it would have made excellent travelling. Our Timber has been rafted on shore at Mr. Brackets landing, but no carts could get to it, and we were threatned with a repeated Snow Storm; I sent Mr. Porter to get Faxon and his two Teems and French's yesterday with ours. They Hauld 16 load and if the weather hold good we hope to get the rest tomorrow, but the Boards have not yet made their appearence. Mr. Porter supposes they will be Rafted as the timber  but it is tedious cold work as they are obliged to work in the water. The vessel would not venture. She was so large to Mr. Blacks creck, they raft from  Germantown. Mr. Black speaks highly of the goodness of the timber, but begs you would not spoil the Building by too short posts. 18 feet post he says. Captain Beals says 20, or build a common open Barn as it is call'd with 16 and the Coach House by itself with 20. They both agree that the additional cost will be only the Side Boards, and that a Building 90 foot with 16 foot posts will look very Grotisk and ugly. But this for future consideration. Mr. Black is fully with you and so is Capt. Beal respecting the placing it in a line with the House, and I believe they have more judgment on these matters than the Dr. I think Nelsons victory must be true for it comes  so many ways and by persons who have seen the official account, that it can be no longer doubted. It is an event which will have great influence in  America; and the Authenticity of it a good prologue for the opening of Congress. ""Who is there to care for Logan? Not one."" Have you seen the Letter said to be written by Barlow to Baldwin? I fear you will miss it. It is publishd in Porcupine paper of 10 and 11 Novbr. If he was really and truly the writer I hope he will instantly be stripd of all diplomatic power, a disgrace to his Country, a reproach and a Scandle. I went to see Brother Cranch one day last week, the first House I have put my foot into since I came Home. I found him very weak and low, I hope mending as his cough and fever have a bated, but he cannot stand many of these turns at his Age. He now sleeps better, but the Dr. thinks he will scarcly get out this winter. I have had a week without a sleepless night. My mind is more setled and less anxious and I hope I am recovering my usual strength. My fever has also absented itself for a week, and to day tho very cold, I wrapt myself warm and ventured to meeting half a day; I hope I have not taken any cold. Michial behaves very well as yet, and I begin to feel like a House keeper again. Billings came yesterday, and I setled with him, and paid him nineteen pounds Six Shillings in full. He says he shall come next Summer and work for you. I want to hear from Brisler and Family. I fear you will be so occupied when you get to  Philadelphia that I shall  get a line a week. My Love to William. Tell him to mind my injunction of an open Ear, but a close Mouth. Tell me who and who inquires after me as if they cared for me. The   paper and Porcupine have undertaken to regret my necessary absence from the Seat of Goverment. I suppose they think you will want some body to keep you warm  and knowing that you are not a David, commissirate your lonely Situation. The paragraph from the  N York paper is a very precious one to me. Remember me to all my Female Friends. I have the vanity to think that the Federal Reps and Senators will miss me this winter. "

","My dearest Friend This is our Thanksgiving day. When I look Back upon the Year, I perceive many, very many causes for thanksgiving, both of a publick and private nature. I hope my Heart is not ungratefull, tho sad; it is usually a day of festivity when the Social Family circle meet together tho seperated the rest of the year. No Husband dignifies my Board, no Children add gladness to it, no Smiling Grandchildren Eyes to sparkle for the plumb pudding, or feast upon the mind Eye. Solitary and alone I behold the day after a sleepless night, without a joyous feeling. Am I ungratefull? I hope not. Brother Cranchs illness prevented Him and my sister from joining me, and Boylston Adams's sickness confineing him to his House debared me from inviting your Brother and Family. I had but one  [illegible]  resource and that was to invite Mr. and Mrs. Porter to dine with me: and the two Families to unite in the Kitchin with Pheby the only surviving parent I have, and thus we shared in the Bounties of providence. I was not well enough to venture to meeting and by that means lost an excellent  discourse deliverd by Mr. Whitman upon the numerous causes of thankfullness and gratitude which we all have to the Great Giver of every perfect Gift; nor was the late Glorious victory gained by Admiral Nelson over the French omitted by him, as in its concequences of Great importance in checking the mad arrogance of that devouring Nation. And here let me congratulate you upon the event, as now made certain. I hope it will prove of Great advantage to us, as well as to all the powers whom France has abused, debased and insulted. I cannot speak of them in the  of Gov. Henry.Tho I like his Speech and belive he made it without the aid of Laudanum, the address from thence I like. Make a good answer to it. I presume you   Philadelphia on Saturday. I wrote to you twice to  N York to the care of Charles and twice I have written to you addrest to  Philadelphia. I hope you received the Letters.  I am as ever Your truly affectionate   "
Sunday December the 2d 1798,"My dearest Friend I last Evening received your Letters, one of the 24th from  Prince Town, and of the 25th from  Philadelphia. I rejoiced to find you safe landed there, so far very far distant from me. As you wrote immediatly upon your arrival I could not expect any Family documents. I hope Brisler will inform me. I am going to send you an excellent Servant as represented to me by my Sister Peabody. Sober, honest and industerous, he lived Eleven Years with Genll. Peabody, is a Native American, and will carry with him what Tom Jones calld a good Letter of Recommendation. I mean a good countanance. He may be confided in and will be a great acquisition to Mr. Brisler if he answers the Character given him. He has been used to waiting, tho not altogether in the manner he may be calld to now. My intention was to have kept him myself if Michial had not suited, but as yet I have no fault to find with Michial who does much better here, than he would at  Philadelphia and  Dexter will be more valuable to you there. He has been used to Horses and can drive a pr. upon occasion but it is more necessary to Mr. Brisler now, to have honest and Faithfull domesticks than ever as so great a weight of care will lie upon himself. I cannot find any vessel going to  Philadelphia, but there is one up for   in which I believe he will take passage. I do not like you should be surrounded with united Irish men tho I find I have one in my Family, but here he will do me no harm. Mr. Porter has had a bad weeks work; with the timber  very heavey they made out pretty well, and got it all home: but when the Boards, joists and Shingles came to be rafted they had to drag them all out of the water upon the Beach and to work in the water for three days. I was obliged to hire four additional Hands at a dollor a day to assist them. They would not undertake for less. Fortunately they have got them all safe on land, and Mr. Porter and French are carting them: from Mr. Blacks they could have gone 5 load a peice pr day. Now they can go only three, but the weather was so stormy and the vessel large, the season so advanced, that they could not be prevaild upon to venture up. The whole Lumber is said to be excellent, but it will take a considerable time yet to get it Home, and then the Boards must all be stuck. In short I think the winter as buisy a time as the Summer. Not a day but what has been fully occupied. The stormy ones were improved in halling the Creatures. I know you like to know how Family Buisness proceeds. Boylstone Adams has a slow intermitting fever and I fear will be confined all winter. No one need have  a more unwelcome Guest. After a weeks absence in which time I gatherd more Strength and got more refreshing Sleep than for two months before, the first thawy damp day it returnd upon me, and out of four Nights I have had but one of Sleep. I did not get a wink the last, yet I must write to you. It is all my comfort. I wish you would ask Rush how I shall contrive to get rid of it and gain my Sleep? Laudanum I do not like. I had rather suffer for want of rest than get into the habit of taking it. Be so good as to tell William that I heard from his Mother, and that she got home well on the Saturday after he left her, but took a bad cold riding in the Snow. Abbe Ann is better,  by Hughes ointment. I shall look for the  with some impatience,tho I do not believe you make a Congress the first week. I received a Letter from J Q A last Evening. Thomas Welch had arrived at  Hamburgh after a passage of 38 days, and was expected at  Berlin. Thomas B A designd to embark from  Hamburg. The Letter is dated 4 Sepbr. I will send it you the next post but first I want to send it to  You will then see it. Mr. Cranch is a little better.   I had a good nights rest the last. I feel better  we had a new fall of snow yesterday. Don't leave my letters about your table. "
"Quincy  December 9th 1798
","My dearest Friend I write you a few Lines just to say that I am better than when I wrote you last, that Mr. Cranch is also slowly mending. Boylstone Adams is not worse. I expect to hear that you have a Great cold. If so I pray you be early attentive to it. I  you the News paper which I take. My Neighbours taking the rest, I see them all. You will find in it the Letter I mentiond to you. It contains nothing more of a publick nature. It mentions the arrival of Thomas Welch and Thomas B. Adams design to embark from  Hamburgh together with Louissas having had a second Sickness similar to the first only not so voilent. We have had a repeated Snow so that the Ground is yet coverd. Our Team and Frenchs employd in getting up the Boards &c. You will write me as often as you can and let me know all that is proper to be communicated but I shall be but a half way politician this winter. With a kind Remembrance to all inquiring Friends  I am as ever Your "

","My dearest Friend I received yours of 28th of  I have not faild of writing to you once a week ever since you left me, and I believe twice, tho the Letters may not reach you, so regularly as I wish. I have kept you informd of our movements. Mr. Porter and French compleated last night getting Home the whole of our Timber, Board, and Shingles. Of the Boards there are more than 30 thousand, and near 50 thousand Shingles. All agree better Stuff was never brought. The Boards remain to be strucke. We have a prospect of winter enough, and long Enough. It began snowing yesterday and continues to increase this day, Sunday, with increased voilence. It bids fair for a very deep Snow, and this at the commencment of December. We must now look to getting our wood, and sleding the manure upon the Hill. We have made great Slaughter with our English Hay working our cattle so hard, and keeping Frenchs, both whilst building the Wall and carting the Timber, for we had no feed for a long time before you went away. I bought a load of Straw for the Horses so that Michial does not use Hay, nor do I let him be so lavish with oats as James used to be, for the horses are so little used that they do not require them and Michial is of opinion that Favorites feet have been injured by  giving him too many. He was been lame  [illegible]   before the Coach man went away, and has been so ever since. His feet are constantly oild and I have had them examined by more than one Blacksmith, but both of whom agree that he has the worst feet they have met with. I have now had his Shoes taken of, and some old ones slightly put on and have orderd that he shall have only two qts oats a day. Be so good as to speak to Mr. Brisler respecting the Blacksmith employd by the Coach man, and let him order the Horses shod by the one whom he formerly employd. The last did not do justice to the Horses. Brother Cranch seems something better  he swells very much. Boylstone Adams was here and dined with me, the last week. I think his fever is leaving him and his cough has done so in a great measure but he is very thin and very feeble. I think he will not get out soon. For myself I have not been so sick since you left me as to be confined to my Chamber, and tho my Spirits and health are in proportion to the rest I get, my sleepless nights are fewer, and my rest better. I have had but one without Sleep for a week and I hope if the Snow does not bank too much to be able to use more excercise. I sent Richard Dexter by way of  Providence. I do not know what luck  he has had in getting on. If you like him as I think you will, I would have him to attend particuliarly upon you, that you may have a Servant whom you can understand. He appeard very desirious of pleasing and he wishes to spend his leisure, if any he has, in learning to write and spell. Cousin William will do well to assist him in this.  Lincoln has been leading me into temptation. I think it best to give you suitable information of it. He has told me that he expects to go to  Philadelphia in Jan'ry if the sleying should prove fine, and that he will take charge of me and go just as I can bear as he shall be in no Hurry and that we may get on so Charmingly if I should find my Health sufficiently confirmd by that time. But I know not whether I shall have courage to attempt it, unless I should hear that you were unwell, and then no difficulty shall stop me short of Sickness on my part. I find the cold weather strengthen me, but you will see in a little time how you make out. I would not upon any account come to be the trouble I have been both to myself and Friends, nor attempt a journey without feeling myself able to encounter it. I see by last Evening  that Russel has republishd the Letter with some of his own observations upon it. I should like to know how it sits at P. as The part which Logan, and his Employers have acted cannot be too fully known and exposed. I scarcly knew how to believe the News paper reports, that Logan dared give himself out as invested with Authority. Jefferson is handled in our papers without much mercy, and will be still more excecrated. He will however find his Supporters. We have news from Dominick  Dominico whether to be relied upon I know not. We wait for the Speech with some anxiety, perhaps none more so than  Your Be so kind as to Frank and forward the  Letters. "

","My dearest Friend I last Evening received yours of  28th. If oceans do not rool between us, mountains have arrisen. The late sevear Snow Storm has shut me in, as close as a mouse in a trap, and that so early in the Season, that no probability appears, of any comfortable travelling this winter. The Banks are so high, so hardly compacted together that they will not be removed untill Spring; I am well persuaded, so that I must sigh at  Quincy, and you at  Philadelphia, without being able to afford each other any personal comfort, or Genial warmth. You say you are fractious; you will have causes enough for vexation I doubt not. The Military arrangment is an ample Feild if you had no other; I see by the paper of to day, that Genll. Brooks has resignd. It reminds me of a story of a certain Irishman who observing that his outer rows of corn were not so good as his others determined that in future he would have no outer Row. It is very difficult so to place the outer row as to satisfy those which succeed, but nothing tends so much to render a Man Fractious as living without Females about him. Even tho sometimes they may be glad to lie low and let the Sand fly over they know how to temper the wind to the Shorne Lamb and to Sooth into good humour the jaring Elements. You see I am willing to keep up my self concequence as well as the honour and dignity of the Sex. I have an Authority in point. Our minister at  Berlin in his last Letter speaking of his Wife says, ""her   Lovely disposition and affectionate heart, afford me constant consolation amidst all the distresses, cares and vexations which the publick concerns as well as my private affairs so thickly strew in my way."" I hope you can Sleep a nights. I find it such a comfort to have my rest returning to me, that I know not how to prize it sufficiently. It restores the little indispositions of the day but I find tranquility of mind so necessary to my rest, that a little matter agitating me is sufficient still, to rob me for the night of that Slumber which is indispensable for my Health. Brother Cranch is getting better. He sees a  of the prophecies in the report of the Prussians being permitted to pass through the Dardenills an Event he has been long looking for, that once obtaind the Door will never be closed untill the Turks are driven out and their citys destroyed, according to holy writ. I shall write to Mrs. Otis from whom I received a kind Letter last Evening, next week, but I  you warnd me against writing much yet it is all my amusement. I want to know how the world passes,tho I cannot gain admittance now into the Cabinet. Remember me to all my old Friends and acquaintance who inquire after me, and tell them that I very much regret, that I have it not in my power to  them those attentions which I should take pleasure in manifesting, if my Health had permitted me to have accompanied you to  Philadelphia. A Good repose to you. I hope I shall enjoy the Same.  Ever yours,   "
"Sunday Quincy  December 16. 1798
","My Dearest Friend I received the  last Evening and found by it that the two Houses were formed and that a committe had waited upon you; that you could not as usual attend upon the day following oweing to indisposition. You will easily suppose that I must feel very anxious from reading this, because I know a slight indisposition would not detain you; I have a Letter from you of the 9th of December. You do not mention having a cold tho I have expected you would as tis impossible to go into that City without taking one, even tho you had not exposed yourself as I think you did upon your Journey. If your complaint is one of those heavey colds to which you are subject, an early attention to is necessary and proper nursing. I hope you have a fire in your bed Chamber and that you do not imprudently throw up and keep up your windows. If you take Lockers pills, you ought to confine yourself and take no air colder than that of your Chamber. They are not to be tamperd with, and I fear you will not be sufficiently Cautious. I shall write to Mrs. Brisler what to give you, if your complaint is a cold. If any thing more serious and allarming I pray I may know it, for I certainly shall venture cold, fatigue and every hazard to come on to you. I am not easy to be absent from you. The more of care and anxiety you have upon your mind, the more necessary it seems to me it is, that I should be with you. I shall be very unhappy untill I hear from you,   I pray Heaven to preserve a Life invaluable to me, and of the utmost importance to the publick. I should think the Sacrifice of my own of little consideration in comparision, and I shall certainly consider it my indispensable duty to risk it, if thereby I can prolong, or render yours more comfortable. I hope  morning will bring me Letters from you, and that you will not fail to let me hear particuliarly how you are. Put your Feet into warm water, and let William Shaw or Richard have a Bed put in the little octogon Room that you may be readily attended, if you have occasion for any thing in the Night. My own Health is better, and if the travelling was not the worst that could be, and the weather  cold I would not stay to consult Physicians. I would inlist under the wing of the old Generall and push forward.   I am my dearest Friend your anxious Sunday Noon Yr  captain Beal I have just received. The Speech in a hand Bill. The mail for monday was anticipated and it was publishd last night. His Son brought it out this noon. I like it well. It does not flinch. I should have been mortified if it had been possible. I cannot however omit observing how perfectly it in Sentiment coinsides with the Letter I sent you of Sepbr. 4th. or rather the Letter coinsides with the Speech; I am still anxious for your Health. I hope you are not very sick.   "

","My Dearest Friend I Last Evening received yours, of the 13th. I believe I must Cheer you up a little, and I dont know how to do it more  than by telling you that I am better, that I rest well a nights, and that yesterday for the first time I drank Coffe at my Sister Cranchs. We had a light fall of Snow two days ago, which coverd the bare ground, and as the Banks were considerably sunk and the Roads pretty well Beat, the travelling is much mended, and I can ride some, every day. But the winter is very severe. Brother Cranch has got to ride out, and so has Boylstone Adams. Our comforts are strewd amidst our perplexities, and we have a Share of enjoyment and Satisfactions which we should most keenly feel, if we were deprived of them. ""No Man liveth for himself."" The Tour of duty falls harder upon some than others and he to whom ten talents is given, must expect if he would receive the precious Reward ""of Good and Faithfull Servant"" to improve them ten fold. To endure and suffer in a Good cause has been the Lot of the Greatest Law givers, Statesmen, Heroes and Phylosophers, nor is their any Charm ofor Tallissman, to Sheild or defence for similiar Characters even in this age  in this age of the world. I observe by the early opening of the debates, that it is not probable there will be less acrimony than upon former occasions in Congress. The Antis are determined if possible to remove the two strongest barriers which the Friends of Government have Erected for their Security and that of the publick. I would move to have as many Coppies of Judge Cushings late Charge to the grand jury publishd and anexd to the Laws, as there are coppies of the Laws printed, To a candid mind I should think it would be equally usefull. I  you my paper of yesterday. There is a foolish Elogium upon H r. I wish people would understand Characters more throughly before they worshipt them. I must say to you as you do to me, pray keep up your Spirits and Buffet the Waves. We shall find a safe post I trust at last, If not in this world, I trust a better awaits us. This is a consolation that our firm belief in the Christian Religion holds out to us, and of this, the world cannot deprive us. I am anxious for the safe arrival of our dear Thomas, but I must commit him to the care of a kind Providence which has  protecded my Family upon the ocean. With a kind remembrance to all Friends   "

","My dearest Friend I believe our Legislatures when they made the House tax were not aware of the trouble  upon the execution of it. To measure every House, Barn, out House, count every Square of Glass, collect every peice of Land, and its bounds and then apprize the whole is a Labour indeed. I have had the Gentlemen here the last week and they have with the assistance of your Brother gone through yours. Major Millar and Abel Alleyne were the persons Authorized. The Major requested the assistance of your Brother. I sat a silent hearer upon all but one Subject which was the apprizement of this House. The Major was loth that it should appear that the president had not the best House in Town. I laught at him and told him I should have no objection to owning the best House, but if the fact was otherways did the Law say, that the owner of the House was to be taken into consideration or the House prized according to what it would in his judgment sell for. Nor if he could say this House was equal to our next Neighbours and some others why then put an equal value upon it. Captain Beals was prized at 3000 dollors. This at 2000 with the outhouse. The House which French and Clark live in at 400 each, Belchers at 200 and Phebys at 75, the land upon the opposite Side of the way 40 dollors pr acre the whole   including Mr. Cranchs Farm; I do not recollect what other lands were apprized at, but I did not perceive any disposition to overrate or over value the Lands. What the tax will be in concequence I know not. Sole is gone. He did not incline to stay unless he could have the same pr Month within half a dollors as he had for eight months. I think his wages for Eight Months much too high as it brought it to December. I requested the Dr. to settle with him and dismiss him, and I would take my chance. I have accordingly hired a man for the three winter months, a much better wood cutter at 8 dollors pr Month, near six dollors pr Month lower than Sole. Mr. Bass has also done, and I had resolution and firmness enough to withstand the old Mans intreaties tho I confess he stagered me several times. He begd I would let him stay for his victuals, which he said he could not possibly earn at Home, that home was renderd a Scourge to him by Seth, that his wife must suffer this winter, and he should starve. I however did not believe all. I told him he should not starve, for I would always give him a meal of victuals when he was in danger. He soon let himself to  Faxon but met with an accident from a log of wood which will disable him for a Month if not longer. We have Snow Storm upon Snow Storm. It has been snowing all this day. Wind at North East. Alass poor

 Thomas, how my Heart beats, as the winds Roar and the Storm beats; I know all my anxiety is of little avail. Yet I cannot divest myself of it. I have I hope relieved your mind of two anxieties, the one for Brother Cranch who is spared to us a little longer, and the other for B. Adams who is also recovering. The Widow Adams has lost her youngest Son the last week with the fever which is still lurking about in  Boston. He was brought here and buried in the Night; I have been out half the day to meeting, tho it was not very pleasent. Mr. Whitman preached. You complain that you are solitary. I know that must be your lot frequently. It is then you want the relief that your talkative wife cared to afford. When I first got down Stairs I felt so too, but I  as  [much] as possible into my Family affairs, brought Porter to counsel me daily upon all his movements, and as I could bear it read, wakd or wrote, and so reconciled myself to myself, some times sighd when unpleasent reflections of those connected with me excited them. What right have I to be exempted from trouble of some kind or other, when a whole world is filld with evils of all sorts. This Letter may serve in lieu of the talkative wife. I hope you put them all in the fire after you have read them. It would mortify me to have one of them found upon your table. Adieu for the present. Did Logan really visit you?   "
"Quincy  December 28 1798 Fryday
","My dearest Friend On  Evening I received the Mercury, and read in it, the arrival of Capt. Jenkins in the  America, on Sunday. You may well suppose I felt greatly rejoiced expecting from Thomas's Letter, that he was undoubtedly a passenger. No mention was however made of him in the paper: I expected for two days to hear of him. Then I conjectured that not knowing of my being here, was the reason of my not receiving a Letter to notify me. In this Suspence I wrote to Mr. Smith requesting him to get intellegence for me. I received an answer from him last Evening that he had seen one of Capt. Jenks owners but that he knew not of any passengers comeing in her. He supposes Mr. Adams is on Board the Ship Barbara Capt. Clark who saild at the same time for  Boston the 30 of october, but I have not been yet able to learn any thing further. I can only pray for his Safety. I watch'd the weather all last week, and tho threatned with a Snow Storm, it past off, with a small slight portion and ended in a Thaw, by which the travelling is again impeeded. It had just got passible, and the Roads were lively. The weather is now moderate and fine. I last Evening received your Letter of   December the 19th. I cannot say that it added to my Spirits or Rest. The dissapointment from Thomas's not comeing had already depresst me, and the reflections and observations respecting our Children calls up so many painfull Ideas, that I cannot be otherways than unhappy when I reflect upon them; in Silence I do reflect upon them daily. I wish it was otherways with them. For Mrs. Smith I feel more keenly; because I know she is innocent of the cause of her misfortunes; she is and always was a dutifull and affectionate Child. I hope better days are reserved for her,tho at present the prospect is dark. With respect to what is past, all was intended for the best, and you have the Satisfaction of knowing that you have faithfully served your generation, that you have done it at the expence of all private Considerations and you do not know whether you would have been a happier Man in a private, than you have been in publick Life. The exigencies of the times were such as call'd you forth. You considerd yourself as performing your duty. With these considerations, I think you have not any cause for regret. What remains to us of Life we must expect to have checkerd with good and evil, and let us patiently endure the one and rejoice in the other as becomes those who have a better hope and brighter prospects beyond the Grave. Much is said in the  Philadelphia papers respecting the united Irishmen. Is there any reason to think them so formidable as there represented? I know there is a banditty  of unprincipeld wretches who are employd as emissaries to keep us at varience. A passage struck me in Fennoes paper last Evening, that the democratic Society of  N York were summoned to meet, by one Davis when some communications of of importance are to be made. I took the more notice of it from having read a preface written by one John Davis the translator as he calls himself, of General  Campaign in  Italy, a work of 300 pages printed in  N York at the Argus office in 98 written by a Genll. officer of his Army. I am now reading it, but the Stile of the preface struck me as the most conceited Bombastical thing I ever read. ""He says he came to this Country the middle of last March,with no other recommendation than a Love of literature. He had caught the Bliss of publication in  England, which will ever constitute my supreme felicity."" As a  of this superb translater work, he is transported with joy to have executed the translation of a work that records the actions of one of the Greatest Warriours the World ever produced; compared to whom Hannibal was a Stripling, Alexander a holiday captain, and Caesar a mere candidate for military Fame."" I would recommend to him to translate Buonaparty Campaign into  . Query is not this the same fellow probably? The Book belongs to Nat'll. Austin the Brother of Honestus. You will wonder how I came by it. For the good of the  it was put into the circulating Library in  Boston, taken out by Mr. Do Greenleaf and by him lent to me. Master Cleverly is still living. Mr. Barrel who was sick when you was here  but a younger  Brother of his who lived with him took the fever and dyed with it. Mr. Cranch is getting well I hope. So is B. Adams. I have not heard yet whether Richard Dexter has arrived. I had a Letter from Mrs. Smith in which she expresses her anxiety at hearing you were unwell and fears you took cold in going on in the Storm. She says she has been greatly afflicted with an Eruption upon her hands which the Dr. pronounces the Salt Rhume, the same which afflicts you. She  of its itching intollerably. Sulpher and cream of Tarter she took. You have always found that of Service to you, and I would again recommend it to you. I  to you a Sermon. Dr. Eckley was so polite as to send me two.

","My dearest Friend I cannot give you any account of Thomas. I have sought for him by  Jenkins. The Barbara which wild at the same time was a better vessel, well armd. Mr. Smith thought it probable he would prefer her as she was for  Boston. I joind him in the same opinion, and was not a little distresst in the Storm on Saturday Evening to hear that she had been cast away on Saturday morning near  Salem, but at the same time I was assured no lives were lost. On Sunday mor'g I sent to Town to be satisfied whether he came in the Ship but find that he did not. The vessel run upon the Rocks bud was soon off, with little damage. I know not how to account for his not comeing, in either of these vessels unless he has taken his passage in some one for  Philadelphia supposing it would save him a winters journey by Land, and that he should sooner meet his parents. Mr. Smith writes me that there were several good armd vessels for the Southward ready to sail at the same time, these were there. I cannot help feeling a daily anxiety upon his account. I am greatly  with the address of the Legislature of  Pensilvanna; it received as it deserved a good answer. The notice of taken in it of the interference of individuals, in what the constitution alone places with the executive Authority, was quite unexpected; I thought it belongd to the National Representitives to have noticed it, and regreted that they should feel so trameld, as to omit it. Their answer is however calld the best which any House have deliverd since  the first establishment of the Constitution. The Jacobins certainly expected a recommendation from the president of a declaration of war with  France, and a closer union with  Great Britain, at least I judge so from the tennor of Chronical pecices. Logans Election in the Legislature will give the Jacobins a triumph, but I believe Mulingburgh would not have been a better choice. Logan seems more fool than Knave. It is thought the V P. stays away from very bad motives. I am told he is considered here as the Head of the opposition, to Government both in the old dominion and  Kentucky. He has is certainly acting a part, that he will find hard to justify. Dr. Tufts  me last week that Mott Vesey had offerd him that small peice of Land adjoing you, of 4 acres for the moderate Sum of 500 Dollors. Would you Chuse to Buy it? It will be put up at Auction if you do not take it. I heard Major Millar say, that John Newcomb had offend Mrs. Vesey 400 for it. How rich our Quincy people are? If it should be sold at Auction, you will please to say whether you would have it bid for, and to what amount. The weather is fine . Can you get time to walk, or to Ride?

","My dearest Friend I received your Letter of December the 25th and am very glad to hear you are so comfortable. I should rejoice if you had fewer perplexities, that you might have more  Sensations; yet if we look through the year which is past, we have abundant cause for gratitude and thankfullness to Heaven both for public and private Blessings and if we have not all we wish, we have perhaps as much as we ought. It would therefore give me great pleasure to receive a Cheerfull Letter from you. With respect to the Barn, I cannot conceive that  more is necessary than a Building calculated to keep the Hay secure, and accommodate the Stock which may be kept upon the place, like the one you built upon French place, only larger. If it is your intention that the Stables make a part of it, they certainly must be of the same height. Accordingly, there are 16 foot posts procured for them. I do not pretend to be any judge my self but tis said by those who are, that it will be a very Heavey looking Building and quite unaccommodating for Stables which will require to be tighter than the Barn. I should therefore think a plain Building for Stables seperate would be the best, but as you will very probable be at Home before any thing will be done, you will judge for yourself. The Boards cannot be struck; they are all Ice and Snow, and we have such cold weather and such repeated Snows, that I do not see any prospect of having them done till Spring.

His whole System is about to be fullfilld in Spight of Pater Wests predictions. I wish I had studied the prophecies. There seems to be so much pleasure in them. Commodore Warren has  the destruction of the French Navey. Fortune, Fortune whom Buonaparte envokes so pathetically, seems to have forsaken them; and the Avenging Arm of omnipotence has overtaken them, through the three Hundred pages which his campaign in  Itally contains. Not one word through the whole, which has any reference to the Being or Providence of a God. What a Set of wretches? Adieu Mr. Black will call in a few  for my Letter.

","My Dearest Friend I believe it was in some such cold weather as the present, that Solomon made the wise observation, if two lie together, they shall be warm, but how can one be warm alone? Now if he had had such a Bedfellow as Louissa, he might have found, that two might lie together, and yet be cold, for I am sure I felt half frozen last night. Ever since thursday the weather has been most severely cold, so as to freeze my ink in my warm Room; it has been as cold ever since Jan'ry came in, as it was intensely Hot last July, The Snow is very deep, and  [ . . . ]  is now adding to the quanity;tho whilst it is so cold there cannot be much. I receive the news papers very regularly and frequent. Whilst there is so great a Majority in the House in favour of Governmental Measures as 65 to 20 there is no reason to despair; I should scarcly wish to see the Names of the Antis united with the Federilists. The address of the Senate of Pensilvana does them honour, but for the Stain of having Elected Logan I should judge that Reason and experience haditstheir proper weight in that State; what kind of Being is this Logan? is he conceited, is he foolish, has he been used as a tool?  poor  Virgina! Thou wilt be a by word and a disgrace. Punishment will fall upon the, and thy wayward ospring. If the French were   not already too much beaten and disheartned, they would send some troops there to Fraternize with them. Buonaparty often made wise and just observations to his Army, and to those whom he wished to conquer. To some Refractory Italians he observes ""that a people who give themselves up to excess are unworthy of Liberty. A Free people are those who obey Laws as well as make them. Anarchy is productive of intestine commotions, and the horrors of civil warfare."" I go so little from Home, and see so few politicians that I do not get any thing very interesting to communicate to you; I see by the papers of last Evening that Mr. Henry of  Maryland, late  is dead.

","My Dearest Friend I received your Letters of  31 and Jan'ry the 1st. I am sorry that it should fall to your Lot to nominate Col. Smith again, and that to a lower Grade than, as a Soldier he merrits. I think however that he was placed in a difficult Situation. If he had rejected the offer those who have stiled him a Jacobin would have attributed it to motives unfriendly to his Country, but as a Man particuliarly calculated far the Millitary department and having served his Country with honour and approbation in the Feild, he deserved  [ . . . ]  Higher Grade of Rank. The New modelling the Army  [ . . . ]  to reconcile him to the arrangment, but I think as an officer, he ought not to have submitted to the Nomination disgraced as he was by the Senate, some of whom I shall always remember for their consistancy, of conduct. The Idea which prevails here, is that Hamilton will be first in command, as there is very little Idea that Washington will be  more than, Name as to actual Service, and I am told that it ill suits the N England Stomack. They say He is not a Native, and beside He has so damnd himself to everlasting Infamy, that He ought not to be Head of any thing. The Jacobins Hate him and the Federilists do not Love him. Serious people are mortified; and every Uriah must tremble for his Bathsheba; I do not consider G.W.  at all a happier Man because he has not Children. If he has none to give him pain, he has none to give him pleasure, and he has other Sources of anxiety, in full proportion. As to conjecturing what is to be the Lot, and portion of the next generation, my only anxiety is that they may have good and virtuous Educations, and if they are left to struggle for themselves they will be quite as like to rise up virtuous and distinguished Characters as tho they had been born to great expectations. Vicious conduct will always be a source of disquietude to me. If my wishes are blasted I must submit to it, as a punishment, a trial, an affliction which I must bear and what I cannot remedy I must endure. Since I wrote you last Mr. Smith has seen  Jenkins. He informs him that Thomas  [ . . . ]  to him for a passage on Board his vessel, but captain  [ . . . ]  advised him not to come in her, Tho a fast Sailor she was a very wet Ship, and a winters passage in her would have been very uncomfortable. He went with Thomas to examine the vessels there and found the Alexander Hamilton Capt. Clark for  N York in which he advised him to take passage as she was a good vessel and a Good captain. She was to sail in a few days after Capt. Jenkins. It is now two Months since you left me, and two more I hope, will return you Here again. Our General Court are in Session. We shall see the  Speach in tomorrows paper I trust.  I have met with some of the Numbers addrest to Genll. Marshall in the Chronical. They appear to me to be the common place Stuff of the party. The same low invective and abuse of the Government for which the Faction are distinguishd, they will not injure Marshall so much as he injured himself. Gallitin and Nicholas have thrown asside even the veil they used to wear. Harpers observations were good but too lengthy, and his Scarcasms Sarcasms very pointed. After the  cold week we have had, last night came a strong south wind and with out any rain; swept away all but our Banks, broke up the sleighing, and left half the ground bare.

","My Dearest Friend Yesterday in high  with his Carriage and four, His Honor the Lieut. Govenour made me a visit. This is the first notice I have received of his Gaurdianship. He desired I would inform the president that he had been here, as he hadpromised him that hewould take care of me. I told him I should certainly comply with his request; the seeing me for the first Time, since the loss of Mrs. Gill renewed his sorrow, and he could scarcly converse upon any other Subject. He seems to have buried with her, his pleasures and his comforts, for he said the 25 years which he lived with her, he never knew an interruption of their domestic happiness, as it respected each other. I received your Letter of the 5th  the Letter from Thomas, which corresponds with what I wrote you;Capt. Jenkings told Mr. Smith; I cannot help feeling still anxious for him and shall,untill I hear of his arrival. If the Senate scrutinize every Character with as much rigour as they have done Col. W S S. I should suppose that some of the Genlls. of the Army would not pass Muster, but I suppose imagine it is the political, and not the Moral Character which is such a stumbling Block. I would however as soon trust Col. Sh as Gen'll. Hamilton. I have not any Confidence in the honour, integrity or patriotism of any Man, who does not believe that. Thou shalt not commit Adultery is a possitive  [illegible]  prohibition of God. Thou shalt not covet thy Neighbours wife, is an other, and yet I have been credibly informd that the Audacious publication of that Man has only renderd him more bold, and hardned in iniquity. It only requires a temptation sufficiently powerfull to Ambition to lead from the path  of political Rectitude; it is a strange way of Reasoning. I would not upon any consideration do a publick wrong or injury, but I can be guilty of breaking the most solemn private engagement and that to one whom I am bound by affection, and by Honor to protect, to Love and Respect. I can disgrace and stigmatize my Lawfull ospring, and feel neither Shame or compunction, but I would not betray a public trust. I cannot see that I commit any breach of Charity in this comment. I read all the public papers and am glad to find Congress so . Some Men prate too much and it is too evident that it is to be admired. They answer their end for I admire at them. I think I never saw Gallitin so netled and so off his gaurd before. As to Nicholas he seems to have brought with him, all the Malignity of Giles, and the Spight of Tailor. I hope I am not too censorious, yet upon looking over my Letter, I begin to suspect that I have given myself a pretty free latitude. I believe I had better close before I attack any other,assureing you that I am in full Charity with all Good Men, and that  I am your truly affectionate   "

","My dearest Friend I received your Letter of  10th last Evening by Mr. Black when he returnd from Town, with one from William and the news papers. If I could but hear that Thomas was safe arrived, I should not dispute the presidene of first visit from him. I presume he would have no hesitation in detemining where it ought first to be made. Every circumstance will certainly lead him to  Philadelphia, being charged with dispatches and those from his Brother and probably from Mr. Murrey too. The much nearer proximity of  Philadelphia to  New York, and more than all the duty which is due to his Father, and the Respect due to the president all make it indispensable that his first devours be made at  Philadelphia; You mention Judges Cushing visit to you, but make me no communications from him of which I know he was fully charged. By the way, I got his Charge  in our Papers and the answer to Barlows Letter, written by Webster as I have been informd; I dont like the president as a correspondent half as well as the vice president. Now dont be allarmd. I mean only your honour, you used to write me much more freely then; now if you chance to say any thing, I am left in a wide feild of conjecture, as for Instance, Judge Cushing had a visit in deleware from Mr. John Dickerson."" I know you will reply that it is not proper for you to write freely, and that you have so many  perplexities you can scarcly write at all, but that you know cannot prevent my curiosity. I am told that there are a series of papers begun, addrest to you in the Chronical upon the worn out toppic of standing Armies, under the Signature of Democritus. I desired the person to inform Democritus that his labour would be lost, as you did not see the paper; and if you did that it was not probable you would ever read them. The extract from a Sermon deliverd in the vicinity of  Boston which attracted my Notice as well as yours is said to have been deliverd at  Milton by Mr. McKean. The answer of the House of  of this State to the Govr. is well drawn, and a tribute paid in it to the chief Majestrate of the union which reflects honour upon him. ""With a patriot and Statesman at the Helm, who is capable of inspiring a whole Nation with noble Sentiments."" This Idea is the more  for the truth which it contains; Virgina will hardly find any Legislature in   to concur in her strong resolutions. What defene has she against the Rebel Irish which we are informd; are to be shipd for  America? With respect to domestic matters I have reported your orders to Dr. Tufts and the 20 foot posts will be procured early in the Spring. Our people have embraced this fine open weather to stick the Boards.  As it is neither Sleding or carting, Mr. Porter regrets that he cannot get the manure upon the Hill yet. My Respects to Mrs. Cushing. I believe I must answer her Letter now. I shall get more political intelligence from her, than from all the Members of Congress and Senate  to them. I am as you see in tolerable Health and very good Spirits.   "
Sunday 20 Janry. 1799,"My dearest Friend I give you joy of the Safe arrival of our dear ; whom you will have cordially received before this reaches you; I shall be happy to see him as early as will be convenient for him: but if it is thought best that he should remain a while with you; I shall acquiese, now I have reason to believe him in Safety. I hope his Health has not sufferd from his winters Voyage. I shall the more readily consent to his remaining a while with you, as his company, and conversation may tend to solace not, your leisure; but your anxious hours. Pray has our General the newly Marquis of Granby, sent you his Memoirs? Our Critics make sad works with them; they are said to be a strange medly and the Hero is not like to acquire more fame, from his pen than from his [illegible]   Sword. I have lately read in the papers, the answer to the address from the Legislature of  Maryland, which has excited a desire to see the address. Be so good as to tell William to  and send it me. You observe in it, that you are not fond of mixing Religion with ."" That is the Idea. I know not (as the paper is lent,) whether I have the exact words. I think however when Religion has been equally attackd with the Liberty and Government of the Country, it is proper to manifest a due Respect for that upon which both the other Rest. I have been assured from respectable Authority that the opportunity which the Chief Majestrate has embraced of bearing publick testimony to Religion, in his replies to many of the addresses presented him, and his pointed dissapprobation of infidelity, has done more to stop the progress of it, and to bring into disrepute French principles than all the Sermons preachd by the Clergy of our Country.   I have endeavourd twice to procure you a set of the addresses but have not yet succeeded. I am told that they are very incompleat and inaccurate, but such as they are I will send them. I was  with a little anecdote which I learnt from a Gentleman upon the replie of the House to the Govr. Speech. The answer calls the French perfidious and unprincipeld."" A Jacobin Member from  Hopkinton rose, and objected to it, He said, he likd the Govr. Speech very well but the answer went further; He thought it was not treating the Rulers of that Nation with proper Civility, to use such harsh terms. A Member from the Chronical Town of  Marlborough rose, and requested that the Epithets might remain. He fully assented to them. Nay Mr. Speaker, if there is a word in the Hebrew, Greek or Lattin Languages, which will express the Sense in stronger or more impressive terms, I would move for adopting them. There were only three dissenting votes. The orders to the  of our Navy are much approved, and admired; they have Heart of Oak in them. Our Stocks are high. There have been not been any at Market untill lately, no deferd Stock to be had at all. Six pr Ct at Seventeen. I have observed that it has been the same at  Philadelphia. The nominal price current has been given; but added no Sellers. Dr. Tufts has made the disposition you directed as soon as it was in his power. A Solomon Thayer has  two Acres of salt meddow and 6 of ceadar Swamp for sale. The meddow lies near what is calld  Rye Island, 50 dollors pr acre the ceadar Swamp at 20 doll. I give you information least I should incur blame for delinquincy as heretofore. Beside I always observe your inclination to abate as for Land, in proportion as I bring it forward before you.  I have no passion for any thing but wood Land, and I believe the greatest Saving of that article may be made by  [illegible]  our Chimney's, which I shall be for trying. I am persuaded half the expence of fuel may be saved and Rooms kept equally warm. French says that the Farm he occupies will not answer any persons hiring, if those  of Land are taken off which you spoke of. Some of the salt meddow he would willingly relinquish and would be glad to hire the Farm for several years, but that there are but three peices of ground which answer manure for more than one year, the peice upon the Hill which was Savils, the  Quincy meddow and the Belcher Land. The other is only fit for tillage and pasturage. If he hired, he should like to take it for three, or more years that he might bend his Strength to manure. Thus much for  matters. I have no Groans or complaints to make, but that of being seperated from you. Every day however shortens the period.   "

How happy should I have been to have folded him at the same time to my Bosom, and felt a pleasure which the Childless can never experience. I have already written both to you, and to him, respecting his  to  Quincy. I know so well your lonely Situation, and your need of some Solace, from the weight and cares of your office, that I can restrain my impatience to see him; whilst I know he is affording comfort to you; I hope you all had an  Evening on wednesday. I should have ventured a sleepless night I believe if I had been with you. They have managed the matter better this year; than the last. On Wednesday I received a visit from president Willard, and Mr. Garry. They were so polite as come on purpose; they both requested me to make their respects to you. The president appears to be quite  tho paller and thinner than formerly; in the course of   the conversation Mr. Gerry asked me if the bill the papers had yet beenladelaid before Congress? I replied that I had not seen any account of them. It is a subject of daily inquiry and some observe that,tho they presume there cannot be any thing very important, yet as the Message denoted some communications, it is rather extrodanary that they have not yet appeard. If they are  for comments: I should suppose they had been long enough in the Hands of . . . . . . . to write annotations upon them. The S . . . . y will not acquire any popularity by this conduct. The public are quite competant to judge upon them without any aid. I own I have felt angry with  [ . . . ]  ever since I read a Letter.Marshall has done more mischief than Mr. Gerry, as his own State demonstrates. Who ever questions the integrity of Mr. Gerrys Heart, does him an injury,tho I thought yesterday from his Slowness of Speech and his round about and about manner of conveying his Ideas, I would as soon vote for a voluable old women to an Embassy, as for him. The weather is now very fine. I hope you have as good in  Philadelphia. Mr. Porter wishes me to ask you whether you meant the Barn Manure or the Yard Manure carried upon the  Hill? or Both.

","My Dearest Friend I have at length procured the addresses and find them better collected and arranged than I expected,  there are many not yet published; If Dr. Tufts should have occasion for some Money he desires to know if he may draw. He applied the interest to purchase principal. Since the new Loan is  there are plenty of Six per cents at market. I have purchased 80 Bushels of oats. I could not get them under three Shilling either in  Boston or  Bridgwater. I can have them  to me here for that price, and much better than what comes by water. Hay is very scarce and dear 7 & 8 pence per Hundred; had I better engage a Hunderd Bushels more of oats from  Bridgwater. We shall have occasion for them when you return. French seems inclined to hire the Farm if he can have Belchers place, and to manure the Grass land instead of planting much, as he thinks Hay more profitable than Corn. I begin now to calculate upon weeks instead of Months, but Congress move so slow, I fear they want to sit longer than March.   "
"Quincy  Feb'ry 4th 1799
","My dearest Friend Your observations in your last Letter upon your Solitude; and your reflections upon your Age and feelings, led me to a train of Reflections upon that period of Life to which we are both hastning, to that period when the wise Man hath told us, no pleasure is to be found. That Frederick who was as great an unbeliever as Voltaire should experience this truth in its full face I can easily believe. How barren and imperfect that prosperity which can have no recourse to Religion to supply the insufficiency of worldly plasures. The following passage so fully expresses my own observations, that it appeard to present itself to me this day with peculiar force, upon reading your Letter. ""Worldly prosperity declines with declining life. In Youth its relish was brisk and poignant. It becomes more sober as Life advances; and flattens as life descends. He who lately overflowed with  Spirits and high hopes, begins to look back with heaviness on the days of former years. He thinks of his old companions who are gone; and reviews past Scenes, more agreable than any which are likely to return. The activity of persuit is weakened. The gaiety of amusement is fled. The gratification of Sense Anguish, when his accustomed pleasures, one after an other flee treacherously away. What can he who is an utter Stranger to Religion, and to the hope of Heaven, substitute in their place? But even in that drooping period, the promises and hopes of religion support the Spirits of a Good Man till the latest hour. His Leaf, it is said shall not wither.  It shall not be in the power of time to blast his prosperity: But old Age shall receive him into a quiet retreat, where if lively Sensations fail, gentle pleasures remain to Sooth him. That hope of immortality which formerly improved his other enjoyments, now in a great measure supplies there absence. Its importance rises in proportion as its object draws near. He is not forsaken by the World, but retires from it with dignity; reviewing with a calm mind the part which he has acted, and trusting to the promise of God for an approaching reward. Such Sentiments and expectations shed a pleasing tranquility over the old Age of the Good Man. They make the Evening of his days go down unclouded; and allowof the Stream of life, though fallen low, to run clear to the last drop."" Who would exchange these Consolations for the cold comfortless prospect of the ? Even suppose it an error, it is one which raises us above the It exalts and enobles our faculties, and the deception if it were one can do us no injury. I hope the time is not far distant when you may return to the Rural amusements of your Farm, snatch a comfort from its opening , and forget the labours and toils of the State, amidst the blooming orchard and the springing blade. To this purpose the clover Seed will not be forgotten. I have written you before respecting the Farm. It is time some decission was made. 45 pounds and the taxes is as much as the Dr. thinks French will be willing to give. I ask you questions, but you forget to answer them amidst your avocations.

It is so painfull and distressing a subject to me, that what I suffer is in Silence. I cannot write you it, but to him; and that I consider my duty; a painfull one it is.

Early in the Month of December I was  that two Hundred dollors were due upon the Shares in the Canal, that the Dr. had been frequently requested to make the payments, had always promised, but had not performd, and that  the Shares must be advertized immediatly for sale. I wrote the Dr. and requested the papers and a transfer of the power to Dr. Tufts as I found immediate attention must be given to the buisness. Still I got no answer. I then wrote to Mr. Smith, and stated to him the buisness requesting him to obtain the papers for me. He did so, and finally I received them, but not till after the quarters Rent of December was received by him, for the House. With the papers no Receits appear, of monies paid by him, or any account. A Letter accompanied them, stating; that an account had been renderd Mr. Adams by his Son when he went to Berlin. I was indebted to Mr. Adams 25 Guineys which I had withheld not chusing to pay it, to either of his Agents. This Money I immediatly paid to Dr. Tufts and made up the remaining Sum which he paid to the treasurer, and stop'd the Sale of the Shares in the canal. I find however by the account stated by Mr. Adams, that exclusive of three quarters of a Years Rent of the House which he the Dr. has since received, there was a balance due to him of 200 90 dollors in the hands of the Dr. which with the House Rent will amount to between 4 and 500 dollors, for all of which, he will never see as many pence; Comments are unnecessary. I received by the last Mail yours of  1st. I have made inquiry respecting the light in which the report of the Secretary is viewd in this quarter and find it is highly spoken of. It is considerd as a measure approved and warrented by the president, but if you will permit a sausy  women to make her comments, she will say, that upon reading of it the Sentiments and Remarks are such as the dispatches, and the duplicity and knavery of citizen Minister, fully warrant, the conclusions are just; and if the Legislator approve them it may save them some long speeches the Subject being amply discust ready to their Hands; but the Qustion which occurs to me is was it a part of the Secretarys buisness thus to teach the National Legislature what to think, and how to think upon matters of fact, Wasit not this implied. ""You are not competant to judging of this buisness without my Aid. I never have heard any person make an observation of this kind. I only say how the buisness struck me. Have you any thoughts of going to the City of Washington before your return Home; it is said your presence is indispensable. Inclosed is the Report of  our Senate and House, upon  Virgina resolves and  Kentucky resolutions.  I am with the utmost affection Your   "

","My dearest Friend I cannot say that I write you from my solitude, for who can call themselves solitary when in the Society and company of a beloved Son, who has been long absent, and who returns to his native Land, with a  Supply of the flowers and fruits which he has judiciously selected, from the various Countries into which he has traveld. He appears very happy surrounded by the Books in the little habitation which accommodates him to his wishes. I wish he could reconcile  to the Idea of trying his talants in this State, and commence his profession here in this Town. It might be some time before he would acquire buisness sufficient to support him, but with the prospect of being driven away by the pestilence, or falling a sacrifice to it in Philadelphia I think the latter evil greater than the former. Yet I must leave him to his own judgment; after having laid before him the advantages and disadvantages he thinks his Brother will settle in  Boston and that they may interfeer with one an others buisness. Yesterday we had a fall of Snow sufficient for . I have received an invitation  to the Ball in honour of Gen'll. Washington but my health is so precarious, and sufferd such a Shock last Summer, that I am obliged to be very circumspect and cautious in all my movements. Thomas will go, and that will be sufficient. I want exercise which will circulate my Blood regularly, and the winter has been such that I have not been able to take much. I hope to ride more and to walk in the Spring. Mr. Porter has carried all the manure upon the Hill which could be got up. That in the Yard is so frozen that it cannot be got up. Let me know whether I may expect you in March, or whether you go to Washington? Love to William to whom I will write if I can.  "
"Quincy  Feb'ry. 25 1799
","My dearest Friend I have not any Letter from you of a later date than the 9th; you was then unwell. I have one from William of the 12th. As he does not mention your being still indisposed I hope it was only  by the Thaw, and the close air of the Theatre. I have myself been confined for a week but got down Stairs yesterday, and hope I have parted with some of my bad humours by the application of Blisters, and a Soar finger. Our weather is so variable that one day we have it intencely cold and the next a thaw. The Ground is again coverd with Snow of a foot depth. It is also very cold. French I believe will take the Farm at a hundred and 75  and pay all taxes. Burrel will remain.  Quincy medow is given up by French. I suppose Dr. Tufts will draw upon Genll. Lincoln in March. In that Month Brislers wages will become due. You will recollect it and settle with him. I did the last March. If Thomas returns to  Philadelphia should you be willing to leave him Clinker? A Horse seems necessary for his Health. He might be kept at a livery Stable, and if he should be obliged to flee, he will have it more in his power to attend the courts in the Country, or come on here on Horse back. I believe he will be determined more by who is like to be the future Gov'r. of Pensilvanna, than any thing Else. If the Democratic Judge, he will seek some other place. If Congress were to sit as long this Year as the last, I believe a Rebellion would break out in some of the States; there is Symptoms enough already of a daring Spirit of out Law, I do not like their complexion. Logan has brought home perhaps our a List of our Directory. I doubt not they were equally attentive to us as to  England,  Ireland and Scotchland  Scotland. The petition of the Alien Irishmen speaks very plain language. I have not any Letters by the post of this day,  the 25 of the month, and William has quitted Claypoles paper by which means I do not learn what is doing. My papers are to the 15th. Congress appear to have done very little buisness. How much is in readiness I know not. I see the appointment of Mr. King, and Smith, in Fennoes paper. I cannot but own that I feel some anxiety upon account of the Bloodhounds, the united Irishmen; if the account of their petition to Congress is any way accurate, no man  of honour or honesty, virtue or integrity would have presented such a daring out rage to the Government; it was a fit office for Livingstone. The Grand Jury have found a Bill against Adams the printer for publishing a Libel upon the Senate and majority of the House, saying that every member who voted in  of the answer to the Virgina Resolutions perjured himself by acting against the constitution which he had sworn  to support. I shall be anxious for tomorrows post. I am much better than when I wrote you last. The application of Blisters has restored to me more quiet Sleep than I have had for a long time.   I am my dearest Friend ever Yours,   "

Febry. 27th 1799.  Quincy","My dearest Friend Yesterday afternoon Mr. Greenleaf  from  Boston, and as he, as well as my others Neighbours; are particuliarly attentive and kind, in bringing Letters and papers to me as well; as of communicating all News. He came full fraught, with the appointment of Mr. Murrey minister Plenipo to  France, a measure which had astonishd all the Federilist; and was a Subject of great Speculation in  Boston. Soon after Thomas returnd from  Boston, thinking to bring me great News but found himself forestall'd. He however got a Good Story in  Boston. Some of the Feds who did not like being taken so by Surprize, said they wisht the old woman had been there; they did not believe it would have taken place. This was pretty sausy, but the old woman can tell them they are mistaken, for she considers the measure as a master Stroke of policy; knowing as she did that the pulse had been feeling through that minister for a long time. Besides the appointment shows that the disposition of the Government is still pacific, and puts to the test the Sincerity of the directory, who if they are really inclined to accommodate have the door held open to them; and upon them rests in the Eyes of all the World, the responsibility. It is a measure which strikes in the Head Jacobinism. It came as unexpected to them, as to the  Federilists. It will also prevent the Directory sending a French minister here which was not desirable, knowing the Nature of the animal. It cannot be considerd as a degradation restricted as I lean the appointment is, that no negotiation shall commence. But with a minister of equal Rank specially appointed to treat; I have not heard an opinion upon it, but revolving the Subject upon my pillow, I call it a master Stroke of polocy, Even tho it should terminate in a buble it brings the nation directory, to the touch Stone. I was  however to see our House of Rep's stop in the midst of a wise measure, and take for granted, what they had no buisness to consider; not a  [illegible]  should be released in concequence of the appointment. To ensure any kind of Success to the negotiation, they should be prepared at all points for War, if it fails. We have had for the last ten days winter as severe as any before. It has frozen the Rivers and bay more than any time before, and it is now snowing with . As to my own Health, it has its up's and down's. As soon as I feel any thing tolerable, I get out, and will not lose the air. Then I get housed a day or two; but I endeavour to keep up my Spirits, and take what comfort I can; as I go along comforting myself that it will be better by and by. In my last I  to you leaving Clinker for Thomas but I did not calculate that he was the only Saddle Horse you had,untill afterwards, when I recollected the loss of one and that I had two here; You mention that Dr. Tufts might draw upon you for any Sum within Reason. The Sum which he will draw for will be 500 , unless you should give orders that any further Sum should be laid out in public securities; I know not the reason, but the funds are allways a shilling in a pound higher here than at Philadelphia. They are now 6 per cents, at 16 & 4 pence, fallen a shilling in a pound since the new loan. As to defered Stock, there is not any to be had. The 6 per cents are the most advantages, only that two per cent is  [illegible]   annually paid off. I wrote you that French would give with Belchers place, 52 pound ten shilling. It looks so like the  of winter that Spring appears far off. I hope you will be at home before much is wanted to be done. I am my dear Friend  Your I forgot to mention to you that the Lot of Mrs. Veseys sold at Auction for 4 hundred and 90 . Prat  has bought it as he did the pew I suppose.  "
"Quincy  March 3d 1799
","My dearest Friend I yesterday received yours of  22d there has not been any measure of the Government since you have been, placed at the Head of it, which has so universally electrified the public: as the appointment of Mr Murray to  France, not the man, but the appointment, it came so sudden was a measure so unexpected, that the whole community were like a flock of frightned pigions; nobody had their story ready: Some call'd it a hasty measure; others condemnd it as an inconsistant one; some swore some cursd and as you observe, the Federalist deserved the Sedition Bill. but what excited the more astonishment, was that the Heads of the departments were not consulted as had been customary; one of which as I was informed took early care to let it be known that it was the first great measure since he had been secretary, that had been adopted without a consultation; who ever will send with attention a late report, might possibly devine the reason why if it was the case, thatthat head was not consulted, and if not him; it would have been too marked to have consulted the rest; I have not  [named?] but to our son; my own conjectures;an other inducement to the appointment, which my own mind has suggested, is the determination of Congress not to declare war. Such a state of armed  [neutrality?] has many disadvantages; attendant upon it, amongst which, is one that our vessels of war  cannot retake any vessels but of our own cration; the Army arrangment, might be an other good cause, I mean the intrigues which the organization of it naturally created; for thanks for power, for Authority &c. Many other Reasons no doubt led to the measure, of which I am sill Ignorant; I said with you, when I read porcupine impudence, that he deserved the Alien Bill. We may see by him, how the measure affects the Englishmen, tho few will venture to be so open and daring, the true Americans whose confidence is firm, and unshaken; believe and say, that the president acts an independant part, pinning his faith upon no mans sleave, and that they are persuaded he must have had motives sufficiently powerfull to lead him to the Measure, but all who see no further through the mill stone than the surface, are pleasd to whichwish the counsels of the Lady had been consulted; ascribing an influence to her, which she wholy disclaims, of one thing however she should have extremly regreted, if it had taken place; I mean that of uniting in the Embassy either the persons mentiond. It is full compliment sufficient to appoint one, after the Reception the  [three?] met with. Some wagers have been laid, that the Senate would not concur, and a curious story in the papers, that the Nomination was committed to 5 members of the Senate, possibly 5 members might be deputed to obtain information, but I do not believe the Senate  [illegible]  will take upon themselves the risk of rejecting the nomination. The shock is has in some measure subsided, and the public expect to be satisfied in time, but they say it is well it did not fall to Jefferson lot to nominate a Minister, that you are not personally vindicative, this new nomination fully proves for personally, who has been more affronted and insulted by the despots of  France? I can fully understand your Quotation from the Statesman: and have been long sensible that your situation is liable to all the shocks, and from the Quarters you describe. I hope Mr Murrays instructions will bind him down, and that he will not depart from them, or take any risk upon himself. I have not any very sanguine expectation of success. My Health which you so tenderly interest yourself in, is better than for some time past, I have been greatly relieved by the Blisters which I applied, and as I have past through my usual Febry scourge, I hope to have a respit for some months at least.  wrote you last week so that I was not so particular. In my last letter indeed I had not then heard any thing upon the Subject, but that the nomination had been communicated in private Letters accompanied with the gastly hobgoblins which men raised at  Philadelphia. Let me know in your next when It is probable I may expect your return to  your affectionate   "

","My dearest Friend Such  cold weather I do not recollect to have felt in March, as it has been this week, and it has laid Thomas up with one of his soar Throats and rhumatism I hope however tho very threatning, that it will not be lasting; I am so well as to ride out, when the weather will permit, and able to look after my poor lad, who I regret has so much of his mothers constitution and infirmities. Captain Brooks  yesterday of a Lung fever, with which he had been sick about ten days; the loss to his Family will be heavily felt. I am anxious to hear from  Philadelphia the result of a nomination which has agitated the public, much more than a declaration of war could have done, the Report of the Senates having negatived the nomination which gave me so much pain and anxiety, was I find, not founded, I presume much of the  has arisen from the mortification of a certain Gentlemans not being intrusted with the Secret, it was hardly fair, or in Character to write upon the first day of the nomination to H--n such a Letter as I have heard was  written; it may however be misrepresented, but of one thing we are certain, no man has been so high, and so Clamourous against the measure as Mr Higgisson. Some persons say he ought to be indited upon the Sedition act, he is much blamed for his conduct, I was told, but I do not vouch for the truth, that he went to Ben Mussel to get him to insert the peices from porcupines paper, which has drawn upon porcupine the Philipic you will see in the same paper, the peices were however rejected with disdain, and nothing not any peice censuring the measure, has appeard in any  Boston paper, but several in justification, You will see one in I Mussels under the signature of Consistancy, the measure no doubt dissapoints, the views of many persons, nor  [ . . . ]  in the least flatter my vanity, to have the public imagine that I am not equally pacific with my Husband, or that the same Reasons and motives which led him to take upon his own shoulders the weight of a measure, which he knew must excite a Clamour, would not have equally opperated upon my mind if I had been admitted a partner in the Counsel. I never pretended to the weight they asscribe to me. The additional nomination will tend perhaps to give more general satisfaction. I congratulate you  upon the Capture of the Insurgent, and wish all insurgent might share the same fate. I hope to learn when I may expect you home by your next Letter,   "

Sunday  Brookfield October 13 1799,"My dearest Friend Here I am at this favorite Spot, I sat out on Wednesday, but was  at  West Town on thursday by main. We reachd here last Evening, and put up at Capt. Drapers. We have attended meeting twice this day, and conclude to remain here untill tomorrow morning. I have heard of you, upon the Road, but once from you which was from  Worster. Mr. Hall I saw at  Westown, and he informd me that you reachd  East Chester on Monday last and that you had a voilent cold. This has made me uneasy and I request you to write to me, at  East Chester where I hope to get, by fryday, and let me know how you are, and how you are accommodated. Brisler bought me a pretty Horse for a leader, 4 years old, thin no flesh, but quiet, yet active and spirits enough, he will be a match for Traveller, but James would soon founder him, as he has most effectually Young Farmer. The first time after you left me, that he was put in the carriage I perceived he went lame. I desired John to examine him, and take him to the Blacksmith. His feet were perfectly sound and good, but one and all pronounced him founderd from grain and so cripled is the poor animal that I know not how I shall get on with him, as he goes like a man with the goute. John gives him but little grain, and says he will Blead him in his feet, as soon as we get to  East Chester if we should be able to get so far with him. I hope you will put all the Young Horses out to Winter in the Country, or we shall have them all ruind. The colt which James rides, travels like an old Horse, and does not mind it at all. We go only 30 mils, and less pr day. I support my journey very well and have slept tolerably, but miss my Luxurious Bed. You had a week of such fine weather, that I hoped you would have escaped a cold; yet it was a week which gave more colds to people than any this fall. The cook and Family with Peter were to go on Board a vessel this day for  Philadelphia. Brisler means to sit out this week if his children get well enough through the mumps. They were just coming on upon them, when I came from Home. I congratulate you upon the late News, as it may have a tendency to restore peace to the world. Regards to William, and to all  others who deserve them from your Mr. and Mrs. Otis desire to be .   "

","My dearest Friend I  this place yesterday about 11 oclock and found the Family all well the Col. with his Regiment gone to the  Jersies. Mrs. Smith and Nancy reachd here on fryday from  Baltimore, the fever still so bad in  N York, that it is not adviseable to go in. We had two very frosty nights upon our Journey, some fogs. I took some cold, Mr. Otis a very bad one. I left him& family at Mrs. Hatens, about 7 miles from hence; our Journey to Springfield was pleasent, with fine roads there. I was obliged to hire a Horse, as young Farmer became so very lame that he could proceed no further in a carriage. James led him on untill we got to Webbs, when having a Horse of Webbs, we thought it best to blead himFarmer in his feet take off his Shoes and put him into a good pasture, and let him run a few days. I could not help feeling angry with Higgins for his obstinacy, the Horse is naturally lazy and deficient in Spirit, which was the reason that he never would drive him if he could form any excuse. Favorite performd very well, stood the journey better than he ever did before, old Farmer very well and Ceasar Brislers purchase I am quite delighted with, steady and spirited as peacock without his rashness. Fille the young Horse came on with James very well. Brisler will be on this week. He will proceed to  Trenton there to take your directions as to going into  Philadelphia. I do not expect we shall get in earlier than the  week in  November. I shall be for crosing the N river as early in the Season as possible. I am anxious to learn if you have got rid of your cold. I found a Letter from here; but it containd more Subject for distress or mind, than comfort. As your quarters are so small at  Trenton you will not wish for company. I will come however and Nurse you, and submit to any inconvenience. If you do not soon get better, you must get some oxemal squills, and take two Teaspoon full in any tea drink of Hysop or Sage, or Balm . Has William escaped a cold.

"East Chester  October 24 1799
","My dear Friend I received yours last Evening of the 21st, when on the road; I could not write; I was generally so fatigued by Evening as to wish to get to Bed. We rose early and as soon we could get Breakfast sat out upon our days journey, at noon we  stopd two Hours; to feed ourselves and horses, and my Lame animal was a constant anxiety to me; I have got him here, and John has physick him, and bled him again, in his feet; but he is so lame, that I cannot attempt to put him in the carriage, for tho he might travel a few miles, he would be sure to sit down on doing down the first Hill; we traveld with him one day, when we walked down every Hill; so that I must either get a stage Horse from Stage to Stage, or hire one to carry me through. I think Brisler will be here tomorrow morning; if his Children got through the Mumps well. The Stage is 5 days now from  Boston, but the Mumps are a six days illness when they are most favourable. Larissa is just taken with them, and is very much swell'd. I am glad they did not attack her upon the Road. You complain that I  have not told you concerning the Farm. We had not a drop of rain from the time you left me, untill the Evening before I left home, when we had a small shower, sufficient to lay the dust, but not to render spreading the manure of so much consequence as collecting apples digging potatoes &c about which they were employd. The day after I left home we had a plentifull rain, but I have not heard a word from home since I left it. I reminded Porter of spreading the manure as soon as possible. The Carpenters were  obliged to go home to training, & review three days, which was a hinderence to them, but they expected to finish the cider house and Barn within in the course of a week, after, except the Clabording. The painter was also going on rapidly. When the apples were collected Porter thought they should make 50 Barrels of cider. The Rails and posts I saw brought home before I came away, and I collected all accounts and paid them off, the carriage wheels excepted, the money for which I left with Brisler. I arranged the House so that it was to be shutt up the week I left it, as soon as the Cook and family with Porter could go, which I expected would be the Saturday after I left them. Mrs. Smith had a Letter from the  last Evening in which he says, that Genll. Hamilton had been on to camp, and that he thought he must not quit the Camp untill the arrangments were made for the Regiments, so that he will not be able to come home for her as she expected,  [illegible]   at present. If Brisler gets here tomorrow as I expect, he will be at   Trenton, on Saturday night, so that I propose to leave here on Monday Senight, or sooner if practicable. (Mr. and Mrs. Otis have got lodgings about a mile from hence), but as I shall hear frequently from you, we can determine this matter as circumstances occur. Duty and Love are presented you from all sides.  "

","My dearest Friend I have only time whilst the Stage stops a few moments to say that I received yours of 24 last Evening. The day was not forgotten by me. Mrs. Smith invited Mr. Otis and Family to dine with us upon the occasion, and made the token of New England thanksgiving a fine plumb pudding, and the company toasted the day and many happy returns of it. Your Letter added to the pleasure of the day by informing me, that the old maidens with their  [No transcription available -- see page image] evenings, had cured you of your cold, a wife should never suffer a rival in kindness or attention; and when I return to Quincy I expect to find a covering of the same kind for you, having got Thomas[No transcription available -- see page image] for a couple of them from his recommendation of them, and he writes me that Mrs. Pitcairn had sent them.  Brisler is just come, but poor little John was yesterday  with the Mumps. He will cross to day, and stop on the morrow if the child should be sick. I shall be ready to meet you when ever you appoint a time, Monday week I , but will be sooner if you think best and Brisler can get on. Let me hear from you.   "

She is rather better today, but nearly blind with the inflamation. I Continue in the determination of sitting out this day week, if the day should be such as that we can cross the ferry, if not the first day that will suit; we may not think it  to go further than the House on the other side the first day, but I shall write to you from thence.

","My dearest Friend I received last Evening yours of the 25, with a Heart filled with gratitude, for the many Blessings I have enjoyed through the 35 years of our union; I would not look upon a single shade in the picture; for if according to Rousseaus philosophy, abstinence from what we delight in, is the Guionism of reason, I have had my full proportion of enjoyment. This day is very fine, I almost regret to lose it; but as I cannot yet go into the city, I am certainly more comfortably and  situated here than at an Inn. I shall not be any expence to the Family, as I know you would not permit it, yet I had rather the expence should be here, than at an Inn. Guion will supply me With a Horse to  for 12 and a half dollars, and a Boy to bring the Horse back, he does not keep any Stage Horses. I think this is high. He calculates upon 5 days absence upon 5 days absence of his Horse, I do not know whether I shall be able to do better. Farmer is so lame that I fear he is ruind for Life,tho he walks better than he did. As to getting any more horses unless you were to part with some you have, it seems to me you will not know what to do with them all, and they are a great expence, but you will do as you think best. I am out of conceit of young Horses for journeying, tho this which Brisler bought, is a hardy Hearty eating Horse. I think you will be pleasd with him. I make no calculation for going further . My inclination will  lead me to  Quincy if my Health will permit, as soon as the Roads are fit for travelling. Caroline Eyes are so bad that she is obliged to be shut up in a dark Chamber. The rest of the Family are all well.  "

We shall get on slowly. I had rather have the Horses want driving than be kicking and  flowncing. I hope you will be very  in your journey not to take cold. I must recommend the Warm Bath to you once or twice before you sit out on your journey. Not hot that will drive the Blood to the Head; but it clears the Skin and renders the perspiration free.

Union Brigade thursday Morg 22 May  [1800],"My dearest Friend The rain  on the morning I left  Bristol, I reachd  [Vantillurys?] about noon and remaind there untill yesterday morning when I procceeded to  Brunswick. Soon after I got there the Col. and Major Ripley arrived, and informd me that Mrs. Smith would expect me to dinner. We accordingly sit out and got here about 2 oclock. The Col. was not able to be absent as Gen'll. Hamilton was on his way to  [illegible]   Camp, and arrived about 5 oclock in the afternoon at the village, and is to Breakfast here this morning. I found the officers with their harps hung upon the willows from the late resolutions of Congress, but they submit with a good grace. I suppose the  has written to you respecting one Brigade, the incorporation of which he seems to have much at Heart, tho he says there are a large proportion of the officers whonew in the Service whom never will be capable of such service as a country ought to receive from men bearing commissions, that in his own Regiment there is but one Capt. who deserves the Name. There are some in the Brigade, Men of real military talents, and Men who are now trained to Service, seasoned, arm'd &c. who are willing to inlist and fill up the Regiments which Congress have ordered still to be kept up of Engineers and articificers. He also thinks it best for those Men who are at a distance from their Homes to be taken by their officers on to the places where they were inlisted previous to the time of disbanding, or otherways a great Number of Men will be turnd loose, perhaps disgrace themselves. Nine oclock. I have just  from  a Reveiw of the troops which Genll. Hamiton and North have given them, and I regreeted exceedingly that you could not see them before they were seperated. Major Tousard will tell you how well they performed. I acted as the Aurora says, as your proxy praised and admired, and regreeted &c. I have only time to add my kindest Love to you, pray you to take good care of your Health. My Coachman and horses perform well. I am just going off.  Yours affectionatly,  "

","My dearest Friend I  this City in good Health last evening. I have not felt dissagreable at any place upon my Journey through absence of any Gentleman attendent, except at this North River I found a Boat just going off, with several Horses and Chaises on Board. My own Carriage could not go. I saw none but Irishmen by their Tongues going on Board, decent looking people however. The ferryman appeard civil and what was of no small concequence, sober. I call'd Richard and took him over with me. We had a short passage of 15 minuets only, a brisk wind you may be sure. Just after I got into the Boat, some person from the House run down with a Letter to me. It was from Mrs. Adams informing me that they had removed to No 30 Broad Street. I landed, and hearing Mr. Hall lived near the ferry, I found the House, and Mr. Hall conducted me here. It is a clever House, and Sally and Susan gave me a cordial welcome. Mr. Adams was at his office. He came home in the Evening and appeard glad to see me,tho a good deal affected by it, inquired after your Health and talkd about the Election, said many Similar things to those which you have already heard. The coalition which we heard of in  Philadelphia had reachd this City.Col. B  s visit, his numerous confidential communications whilst at  Philadelphia are beleived by many. You took him to your own Room and there a coalition of parties took place. Mr. Madison too is to be Secretary of State in case of the refusal of Marshal. I am told that Col. Burr has said, that Col. Smith was appointed to the place now held by Mr. Lapher. This gained so much credit, that Mr. Morris who is in the office of Mr. Sands, and who is desirious of obtaining  it, that he told Mr. Adams that tho he thought he might entertain a reasonable hope of having the appointment from his Services in the office which he now held but he felt so much for Col. Smith and his family that he should not open his Lips upon the occasion. There is a very general regreet exprest, for the Col., he is considerd as the former of the troops as the chief hand in their order, decipline and regularity, and I really think if there is any opening to which he could be appointed it would not be considred improper, unless by those who may themselves wish for it, and the number of those are pretty numerous. A military appointment is what he is peculiarly fitted for. I do not know what call there is for any officers of that description unless in the fortification Line. Burrs report, I take to be for mere political purposes. The pardon of all the insurgents was unexpected here. It was generally supposed that Fries would have been made an example of. There are many picaroons in this city. Malcombe says for several days there was no opening ones mouth at the  House. I saw Mr. Sands and Mr. Giles the Marshall. They made me a visit to day. They appeard much mortified at their late Election. They say, that they urged and others to permit themselves to be put up, but no, they would not. is devoted to P sent out all the antifeds he could pick up to vote against the federal party, the report of much Moneys being expended is current. Tomorrow morning I shall  my journey and hope to reach  Quincy by tomorrow week. I have got Thomas Books such as were  on Board a vessel. Inclosed is the Bill of lading. Write to me so that I may find a Letter at the post office at   New Haven and at  Hartford with a direction that the Letters remain in the office untill sent for by Mrs. Adams. I received Mr. Shaws Letter and News paper to day. My Love to Mr. Shaw. I shall write to him soon. I shall direct my Letters to Thomas care in  Philadelphia when I find he has returnd to the city.  "
"Quincy  June 2d 1800
","My dearest Friend Mr. Gore came out this afternoon to see me; and  me that Mr. Dexter proposed to sit out tomorrow for  Washington. By him I embrace the earliest opportunity of informing you of my safe arrival at  Quincy on Saturday the last day of May, in good health tho some thing fatigued. I got on very well, met with no accident, Horses all in good order. I found our Friends here well. The Hill looks very well, Mr. Porter says those parts which were manured will have a good crop of grass. We have had very plentifull rains, grain and grass promise well, but our verdure here is not so deep, nor our grain so forward by any means. We are three weeks later. The building progresses, but not so fast as I wish. Mr. Dexter can give you a more accurate statement of parties and  than I am able to. I met with judge Hobart upon a visit at  Fairfield. He came and spent the Evening with me at  Penfields. Upon the subject of a late removal he said there had been some considerable sensation in that State at first, but that thinking people agreed that the President was certainly right in calling to his aid Men who would act with him. The Jacobins in  Boston say: or rather certain persons who call themselves federilists say, that it is an Electioneering measure. Others say that the  [federilists] as well as Jacobins want to get a Man whom they can manage. Burr means to be voted for in  N. York and says that it will be of no use to sit up Pinckney. Several people are disgusted with Harpers letter to his constituents, they consider it as a lukewarm buisness, that part of it wherein he appears to think it quite a matter of indifference whether Mr. A. or Mr. Pinckney is elected. I have not got a line from you or Mr. Shaw since I left  New York. I hope to hear from you this week. I say to every   body who inquires, that Gen'll. Marshall will accept his appointment. I should be sorry to believe that he would not deserve as well of his Country as Mr. Dexter. Good old Gen'll Lincoln call 'd on Saturday Evening to inquire if they had not kill'd you yet. I told him no, that you would live to kill half a dozen more politically, if they did not stear steady. Our old  and tennant Elijah Belcher dyed yesterday morning. A kind remembrance to all Friends.  Affectionatly Yours &c., Mrs. Smith is at  N. Wark with the 's Mother. She could not come on when I did having arrangements to make, and being uncertain what the Col. would do this Summer. If he goes up to the  Miami with his Brother, She would be glad to come with you when you return to  Quincy. Mr. Shaw can take the Stage.

"Saturday Quincy  October 18th 1800
","My dearest Friend I have not written to you since you left , but as I knew you must feel anxious to hear I write tho it will but add to your apprehensions; my own Health has mended, tho the weather has been so wet and unpleasent that I have not dared to venture out, not even to see my dear sister in her sickness and distress. She is very low with the fever confined to her Bed, Katy Gannet taken down, and George Palmer, added to this Mrs. Norten was thought dyeing all thursday. She is since a little revived,tho exceeding dangerous from the same cause which carried off poor Humphries. The fever spreads, there are 8 new cases since last week. Jackson is very sick with it, and has not left his Bed since you went away. The Dr. hopes he will not be worse. I have sent to his Father and Friends to inform them; and prevaild upon Mr. Porter to have him removed down to the Farm House, as it was very inconvenient to me, and prevented my making any progress in getting ready to go away, taking my help to attend him. I have to seek an other coachman. Mr. Black and Mr. Smith are upon the inquiry. I wrote to Sole, but his wife was so sick that he could not leave her. It is very distressing to me to leave my sister, whom I owe so much for her attention and kindness to me at all times, but more particuliarly in my long Sickness. When I might be of service to her, all the aid I can afford her whilst I stay, is by watchers, and my help are very ready to serve me, for her. the Season is growing cold and wet. I shall endeavour to get away next week if I am successfull in procuring a driver. I must commit my dear Friends to a kind providence, and with a heavey heart leave them. I got Mr. Shaws Letter from William's since which I have not heard from you. I pray God preserve you, and give us a joyfull meeting. Mrs. Brisler had a Letter from Mr. Brisler at  Washington last Evening dated the 8th day after he left here. He tells  he fears he shall be worse off, than Adam was in paridice, for he had a woman provided for him but there they tell him no such Being is to be had. He therefore requests I would send him a freight. I shall make every exertion in my power. Inclosed you will find some return Letters.  with Love to William  "
"Quincy  October 27 1800
","My dearest Friend After a Sleepless night I begin my journey, with an anxious mind, not a desponding one. My dear Sister is I hope out of danger, tho so low and weak as not to be able either to stand or walk. Mrs. Norten whom we had all burried in our expectations, is getting up again. Thus have I cause of comfort that death has not enterd their doors. Whilst in my own family I have cause to mourn the death of poor Jackson whom last week I burried. The two Shipleys were also threatned with the same fever and Mrs. Porter. To all of them and to Mrs. Smith the doctor administered Emetic's and calomil. They are all better. Shipley however is not yet out. I have been anxious that I have not heard from you. I have made all the haste I could under the circumstances of distress in which my sisters family have been. My own weak state of body, and the agitation of my mind from the Sudden death of Jackson, and the apprehension of the fever upon others has distrest me greatly. New cases daily occur. Shipley and the two Girls I send off tomorrow. Becky I hope will deliver you this. My journey is a mountain before me, but I must climb it. Mrs. Smith I take to  . P.S. I will write you upon the road.  "
"Philadelphia  Nov'br 11th 1800
","My dearest Friend I  this city on Sunday Evening, and have waited one day to rest myself and Horses. My health is but feeble and a little over fatigue deprives me of my rest. I shall sit off this morning, but cannot make more than 25 or 30 miles a day. I shall endeavour to reach  Washington on Saturday if the weather will permit. It would be an ease to the horses if  [Curry?] could come half way to Baltimore and take me in the Chariot. Thomas accompanies me. I received your Letter when I arrived here which was the first line I have got since you left me, tho I have regularly followd you in your stages and heard of your Health and good spirits with pleasure. I have twice heard from Brother Cranch, who writes me that my dear Sister and family are getting better, tho slowly. Still new cases arise in the neighbourhood. I met upon my jouney at  the polite Letter of the Generals and had no reason to make the exclamation of ""Oh that mine Enemy had written a Book."" A Book it is as wise and judicious as the former precious confessions and will produce upon the public mind an effect exactly the reverse of what was intended. My Girls I hope arrived safe. You will not make a Congress on Monday. Very few of our Eastern Members have yet come on.  With the hopes of meeting you in health at the time named I am your ever affectionate  [The preceding text was added in the handwriting of Thomas Jefferson]   "
"Baltimore  13 Feb'y 1801
","My dearest Friend I arrived here about half after six, without any accident, but beat and  enough. I do not wish for the present, a severer punishment to the Jacobins and half feds who have sent me home at this Season, than to travel the Roads in the San Culot Stile just now; the Roads were hard frozen points up, all the way. We were 4 hours making our first stage, and then commenced a voilent Snow Storm. When we made our 2d Stage which was Spurriers, we found ourselves so late that we could not stop but to change our Horses, and came through without taking a mouthfull of refreshment. Poor little Susan streachd herself upon the floor as soon as she got in and fell fast asslepe. I am not so weary however as to have lost my curiosity about the fate of the Election, and would give something to know the result. I shall rest here tomorrow, and the next day pursue my journey. I wish however Mr. Cranch could overtake me, which he might do if he sits out on Sunday. I shall have some difficulty in crossing the  Susquahannah. I think I ought to have a Gentleman with me, it is too bad to travel these Roads without. Hoping you will find them much   by the 4th March, I conclude.  "
"Philadelphia  Febry 19 1801
","My dearest Friend I  this city on tuesday Evening. At  Baltimore  Leiut. Parker came in to see me, and offerd his service to me; I had engaged a carriage of Evans to take me here with good horses and a carefull driver., for which I was to give him 80 dollars, or in proportion if I could not get across the  Susquahannah. I offerd Mr. Parker a seat with me. He was very usefull to me and exerted himself very much or I should still have been at the River; when we got there on Sunday Evening, we found the River frozen over, but not hard enough for any but foot passengers, horses having fallen in attempting to cross. We sent over to see if Horses and a Carriage could be procured upon the other side, but received for answer, that the demand had been so great the week before, for  Washington, that double Stages had run down all the Horses. The Night was cold, and Mr. Parker rose before the Sun and tried sending a Horse over, as he did not break through, he got Spars fixd under the carriage and Men to draw it over, some at the pole, some holding the Spars, and some pushing behind. Having effected this, the Horses were all led over, and then they put us in a boat, and drew us over the same way; the Ice however breaking near the Shoar and letting the Men in above their Boots. I was thankfull for our Success. It soon began to thaw, and no horses could pass in one hour. We got on, and lodged at  Christiana. Sit off early in the morning with better roads than I expected. It began raining hard about two hours before we reach'd the city, continued through the Night, and all day yesterday, a mere flood. I rejoiced, that we had got through all the Creeks, which must now be impassible. Townsend got to  Baltimore on Saturday night, the Horse very lame but I do not see that travelling has much increased it, but it would not answer to draw him. The Roads to  N York are bad as possible after this Rain. I shall send him off to day to make the best of his way home; whilst the baggage at Mr. Staal was carrying up stairs, Townsend went to carry his horses to the Stable. He put his port manteau into the entry, but when he returnd it was taken off; and an umbrella belonging to one of the Gentlemen Lodgers. In his port Manteau he had put all his Money thinking it safer than in his pocket. That which Mr. Brisler gave him was also in his pocket Book, for I had paid his expences upon the Road; he had notes of hand to the amount of 200 dollars, and all his Cloaths beside; the poor fellow looked as if he had lost all his Friends. Mrs. Staal says she has lived six years in the House, had the baggage of all the travellers who have come to the house frequently left for hours in the same place; and never lost any thing untill last week a pr of Boots were taken from the passage. I intend sitting out tomorrow if Mr. Adams can be ready. The Roads are so bad that he has determined to accompany me to  . I hear this morning the result of tuesday . I wish the Gentleman much joy and happiness with his Bride. I fear she will prove a very vixen to him. I shall write to you as soon as I get to  .  "
" [Philadelphia,  21 February 1801]","My Dear Sir I write You once More from this city. The Trenton River is impassable, and has prevented my Sitting out. We hope however that the Rain may clear it. I sent Townsend of ; I have heard Some of the Democratic rejoicing Such as Ringing Bells & fireing cannon; what an inconsistancy Said a Lady to me to day, the Bells of Christ Church ringing peals of rejoicing for an Infidel President! The People of this city have evidently been in terror, least their Swineish Herd should rise in rebellion and Seize upon their property & share the plunder amongst them; they have permitted them really to overawe them; I foresee some day or other that  N England will be obliged to march their Militia to preserve this very state from destruction. There is great uneasiness with the Merchants. They Say the senate by rejecting the article  to which they have excepted, have plunged them into great difficultys-- that they know not what to do-- that a better convention as it respects Commerce could not have been made and why it should be hazarded by the senate they cannot conceive the difference Mr. Breck told me it would make to this Country in one Year, would be nine Millions of dollars. The Chamber of Commerce meet this Evening and send off an express tomorrow to the Senators of this state, hopeing that Something May yet be done; that the President May be requested to return the convention to the senate with his reasons, and by  Means give the Senate an other opportunity of accepting it.the Mr. Breck says that he wrote the Sentiments of the Merchants of this city to mr. secretary Otis requesting him to communicate them to mr. Bingham & others, Whilst the convention was before the senate; they regreet that they did not exert themselves more. I could not help smiling when Mr. Breck told Me he had conversed with mr. Wolcott, but could get no satisfaction, only mr. Wolcott Said that there was no faith to be placed in French , treaties or conventions. I  shall leave this city tomorrow. I believe there is scarcely a Lady who ever came to the Drawing Room but has visited me, either old or young--and very many Gentlemen; as to a return of their visits, they cannot expect it; I believe they have made a point of it. Who publishd my arrival in the papers I know not, but the next morning by ten oclock rainy as it was, they began to come and have continued it by throngs ever since. I thank them for their attention and politeness, tho I shall never see them again. Adieu my dear Friend-- I wish you well through the remainder of Your political journey. I want to see the list of judges.   With Love to William  "
