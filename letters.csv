 [Braintree?                         1762 - 1763]," Miss Jemima I have taken the best Advice, on the subject of your Billet, and I find you                     cannot compell me to pay unless I refuse Marriage; which I never did, and never                     will, but on the Contrary am ready to have you at any Time. I hope  Conscience                     has as good a Memory as mine.  "
Octr. 4th. 1762," By the same  that the Bearer hereof satt up with you last night I hereby order you to give him, as many Kisses, and as many Hours of your Company after 9 O'Clock as he shall please to Demand and charge them to my Account: This Order, or Requisition call it which you will is in Consideration of a similar order Upon Aurelia for the like favour, and I presume I have good Right to draw upon you for the Kisses as I have given two or three Millions at least, when one has been received, and of Consequence the Account between us is immensely in favour of yours,  "
"Braintree Feby. 14th. 1763
","Dear  Accidents are often more Friendly to us, than our own Prudence. I intended to have been at  Weymouth Yesterday, but a storm prevented. -- Cruel, Yet perhaps blessed storm! -- Cruel for detaining me from so much friendly, social Company, and perhaps blessed to you, or me or both, for keeping me at my Distance. For every experimental  knows, that the steel and the Magnet or the Glass and feather will not fly together with more Celerity, than somebody And somebody, when brought within the striking Distance -- and, Itches, Aches, Agues, and Repentance might be the Consequences of a Contact in present Circumstances. Even the Divines pronounce casuistically, I hear,  ""unfit to be touched these three Weeks."" I mount this moment for that noisy, dirty Town of  Boston, where Parade, Pomp, Nonsense, Frippery, Folly, Foppery, Luxury, , and the soul -- Confounding Wrangles of the Law will give me the Higher Relish for Spirit, Taste and Sense, at  Weymouth, next Sunday. My Duty,  owing! My Love to Mr. Cranch And Lady, tell them I love them, I love them better than any Mortals who have no other Title to my Love than Friendship gives, and that I hope he is in perfect Health and she in all the Qualms that necessarily attend a beginning Pregnancy, and in all other Respects very happy.  "
April 20th. 1763," Love sweetens Life, and Life sometimes destroys Love. Beauty is desirable and Deformity detestible; Therefore Beauty is not Deformity nor Deformity, Beauty. Hope springs eternal in the human Breast, I hope to be  next Fall than I am at present, and this Hope makes me happyer now than I should be without it. -- I am at  Braintree but I wish I was at  Weymouth! What strange Revolutions take Place in our Breasts, and what curious Vicissitudes in every Part of human Life. This summer I shall like  Weymouth better than  Braintree  but something prompts me to believe I shall like  Braintree next Winter better than Weymouth. Writers who procure Reputation by flattering human Nature, tell us that Mankind grows wiser and wiser: whether they lie, or speak the Truth, I know I like it, better and better. -- I would feign make an original, an Exemplar, of this Letter but I fear I have not an original Genius.  is gone to Ordination, I know. I have not seen him, nor heard of him, but I am sure that nothing less than the Inspiration of his Daemon, that I suppose revolted from him somewhere, near the foot of  Pens-Hill, could have given me Understanding to write this Letter. This is better Reasoning than any I learned at Colledge. Patience my Dear! Learn to conquer your Appetites and Passions! Know thyself, came down from Heaven, and the Government of ones own soul requires greater Parts and Virtues than the Management of Kingdoms, and the Conquest of the disorderly rebellious Principles in our Nature, is more glorious than the Acquisition of Universal Dominion. Did you ever read Epictetus? He was a sensible Man. I advise you to read him: and indeed I should have given this Advice, before you undertook to read this. It is a silly Affectation for modern statesmen to Act or descant upon Ancient Principles of Morals and Civility. The Beauty of Virtue, The Love of ones Country, a sense of Liberty, a Feeling for our Fellow Men, are Ideas that the Brains of Men now a Days can not contemplate: It is a better Way to substitute in the Place of them, The Beauty of a  Lady, the Love of Cards and Horse Races, a Taste in Dress, Musick, and Dancing, The Feeling of a pretty Girl or Fellow and a genteel Delicacy and Complaisance to all who have Power to abuse us. I begin to find that an increasing Affection for a certain Lady, (you know who my Dear) quickens my Affections for every Body Else, that does not deserve my Hatred. A Wonder if the Fires of Patriotism, do not soon begin to burn!  And now I think of it, there is no possible Way of diminishing the Misery of Man kind so effectually as by printing this Letter. It is an intolerable Grievance and Oppression upon poor literary Mortals, to set wasting their Spirits And wearing out that great Gland the Brain, in the study of order and Connection, in  every Part of their Compositions to  [ . . . ]  certain scope. This keeps them besides  [from] the joys of seeing their Productions in Print, several days longer than they is needful, (not nine years indeed, according to those fools the Ancients): We are to our Honor grown a good deal wiser than they. Now I can demonstrate that a Man  write three score Years and ten, after the Model of this Letter, without the least Necessity of Revisal, Emendation or Correction, and all that he should write in that time would be worth Printing too. -- I find the Torrent Hurries me down, but I will make a great Effort to swim ashore to the Name of To the great Goddess   "
Saturday morning Aug. 1763,"My dear  Germantown is at a great Distance from  Weymouth  Meeting-House, you know; The  of Yards indeed is not so prodigious, but the Rowing and Walking that lyes between is a great Discouragement to a weary Traveller. Could my Horse have helped me to  Weymouth,  Braintree would not have held me, last Night. -- I lay, in the well known Chamber, and dreamed, I saw a Lady, tripping it over the Hills, on  Weymouth shore, and Spreading Light and Beauty and Glory, all around her. At first I thought it was Aurora, with her fair Complexion, her Crimson Blushes and her million Charms and Graces. But I soon found it was Diana, a Lady infinitely dearer to me and more charming. -- Should Diana make her Appearance every morning instead of Aurora, I should not sleep as I do, but should be all awake and admiring by four, at latest. -- You may be sure I was mortifyed when I found, I had only been dreaming. The Impression however of this dream awaked me thoroughly, and since I had lost my Diana, I enjoy'd the Opportunity of viewing and admiring Miss Aurora. She's a sweet Girl, upon my Word. Her breath is wholesome as the sweetly blowing Spices of  Arabia, and therefore next to her fairer sister Diana, the Properest Physician,  for your drooping  "
Monday Morning  [15 August?] 1763,"The Disappointment you mention was not intended, but quite accidental. A Gentleman, for whom I had much Esteem, Mr. Daniel Leonard of  Norton, was so good as to offer to keep the sabbath with me at  Braintree -- a  that would have been very agreable if it had not detained me from the most agreable of all Company, to me, in this world, and a favour that will I know be sufficient with you to excuse me. -- A good Nights sleep I have had but not more than I should have had, for a Friend always keeps me awake till Midnight and after. Shall return from  Boston I hope time enough to obey, which I always do with more Pleasure than I ever command.  "
Saturday Evening Eight O'Clock  [7 April 1764],"My dear  For many Years past, I have not felt more serenely than I do this Evening. My Head is clear, and my Heart is at ease. Business of every Kind, I have banished from my Thoughts. My Room is prepared for a Seven Days' Retirement, and my Plan is digested for 4 or 5 Weeks.  retreats with me, to our preparatory Hospital, and is determined to keep me Company, through the Small Pox. Your Unkle, by his agreable Account of the Dr. and your Brother, their Strength, their Spirits, and their happy Prospects, but especially, by the Favour he left me from you, has contributed very much to the Felicity of my present Frame of Mind. For, I assure you Sincerely, that, (as Nothing which I before expected from the Distemper gave me more Concern, than the Thought of a six Weeks Separation from my Diana) my Departure from your House this Morning made an Impression upon me that was severely painfull. I thought I left you, in Tears and Anxiety -- And was very glad to hear by your Letter, that your Fears were abated. For my own Part, I believe no Man ever undertook to prepare himself for the Small Pox, with fewer than I have at present. I have considered thoughrououghly, the Diet and Medicine prescribed me, and am fully satisfyed that no durable Evil can result from Either, and any other Fear from the small Pox or it's Appurtenances, in the modern Way of Inoculation I never had in my Life. -- Thanks for my Balm. Present my Duty and Gratitude to Pappa for his kind offer of Tom. Next Fryday, for certain, with suitable Submission, We take our Departure for  Boston. To Captn. Cunninghams We go -- And I have not the least doubt of a pleasant 3 Weeks, notwithstanding the Distemper. -- Dr. Savil has no Antimony -- So I must beg your Care that John Jenks makes the Pills and sends them by the Bearer. I enclose the Drs. Directions. We shall want about 10 I suppose for my Brother and me. Other Things we have of Savil. Good Night, my Dear, I'm a going to Bed! Sunday Morning 1/2 After 10. The People all gone to Meeting, but my Self, and Companion, who are enjoying a Pipe in great Tranquility, after the operation of our Ipichac. Did you ever see two Persons in one Room Iphichacuana'd together? (I hope I have not Spelled that ineffable Word amiss!) I assure you they make merry Diversion. We took turns to be sick and to laugh. When my Companion was sick I laughed at him, and when I was sick he laughed at me. Once however and once only we were both sick together, and then all Laughter and good  deserted the Room. Upon my Word we both felt very sober. -- But all is now easy and agreable, We have had our Breakfast of Pottage without salt, or Spice or Butter, as the Drs. would have it, and are seated to our Pipes and our Books, as happily as Mortals, preparing for the small Pox, can desire. 5 o clock afternoon. --  has been here and drank Tea with me. His Children are to go with us to Cunninghams. He gives a charming Account of the Dr. and your Brother, whom he saw Yesterday.Billy has two Eruptions for certain, how many more are to come is unknown -- But is as easy and more (the Deacon says) than he ever saw him in his Life. Monday. Ten O'Clock. -- Papa was so kind as to call and leave your Favor of April the Eighth -- For which I heartily thank you. Every Letter I receive from you, as it is an Additional Evidence of your Kindness to me, and as it gives me fresh Spirits and great Pleasure, confers an Additional Obligation upon me. I thank you for your kind and judicious Advice. The  made me the offer Yesterday, which, for the very Reasons you have mentioned, I totally declined. I told you before We had taken our Vomits and last Night We took the Pills you gave me, and we want more. Lent We have kept ever since I left you, as rigidly as two Carmelites. And you may rely upon it, I shall strictly pursue the Drs. Directions, without the least Deviation. Both the Physick and the Abstinence, have hitherto agreed extreamly well with me, for I have not felt freer from all Kinds of Pain and Uneasiness, I have not enjoyed a clearer Head, or a brisker flow of Spirits, these seven Years, than I do this day. My Garden, and My Farm, (if I may call what I have by that Name) give me now and then a little Regret, as I must  leave them in more Disorder than I could wish. But the dear Partner of all my joys and sorrows, in whose Affections, and Friendship I glory, more than in all other Emoluments under Heaven, comes into my Mind very often and makes me sigh. No other Consideration I assure you, has given me, since I began my Preparation, or will give me I believe, till I return from  Boston any Degree of Uneasiness. Papa informs me that Mr. Ayers goes to Town, tomorrow Morning. Will you be so kind as to write the Dr., that I shall come into Town on , that I depend on Dr. Perkins and no other. And that I beg he would write me whether Miss Le Febure can take in my Brother and me in Case of Need. For My Unkle writes me, I must bring a Bed, as his are all engaged, it seems. I have written him, this Moment, that I can not carry one, and that he must procure one for me, or I must look out Elsewhere. I shall have an Answer from him to night and if he cannot get a Bed, I will go to Mrs. Le Febures if she can take us. Should be glad if Tom might be sent over,  Morning. My Love and Duty where owing. Pray continue to write me, by every opportunity, for, next to Conversation, Correspondence, with you is the greatest Pleasure in the World  to yr. PS. My Love to . Thank em for their kind Remembrance of me, and my Blessing to my Daughter Betcy.  "
"Braintree  Ap. 11th. 1764
","My ever dear  The Room which I thought would have been an Hospital or a , has really proved a Den of Thieves, and a scene of Money Changers. More Persons have been with me about Business, since I shut up, than a few, and many more than I was glad to see, for it is a sort of Business that I get nothing by, but Vanity and Vexation of Spirit. If my Imprisonment had been in Consequence of Bankrukpty Bankruptcy, I should not have endured much more Mortification and Disquiet. I wish this Day was a Fast, as well as Tomorrow, that I might be sure of two Days Tranquility, before my Departure. I am not very impatient at present: Yet I wish I was at  Boston. Am somewhat fearful of foul weather, on Fryday. If it should be, the very first fair Opportunity must be embracd. Abstinence from all, but the cool and the soft, has hitherto agreed with me very well; and I have not once transgressed in a single Iota. The Medicine we have taken is far from  being loathsome or painful or troublesome, as I own I expected. And if I could but enjoy my Retreat in silence and solitude, there would be nothing Wanting but Obliviscence of your Ladyship, to make me as Happy as a Monk in a Cloyster or an Hermit in his Cell. You will wonder, perhaps at my calling in Monks and Hermits, on this Occasion, and may doubt about the Happiness of their situations: Yet give me leave to tell you freely, the former of these are so tottally absorbed in Devotion and the latter in Meditation, and such an Appetite, such a Passion for their Respective Employments and Pleasures grows  habi  habitually up in their Minds, that no Mortals, have a better security of happiness (excepting him who hopes to be bound to your Ladyship in the soft Ligaments of Matrimony) have has a better security for Happiness than they. Hitherto I have written with the Air and in the style of Rattle and ; but now I am about to abo shift to the grave and sober the sober and the Grave.-My Mamma  is as easy and composed, and I think much more so than I expected. She sees We  are determined, and that opposition would be not only fruitless, but vexatious, and has therefore brought herself to acquiesce, and to assist in preparing all Things, as convenient conveniently and comfortably as she can. Heaven reward her for her kind Care, and her Labours of Love! I long to come once more to  Weymouth before I go to  Boston. I could, well enough. I am as well as ever, and better too. Why should not I come? Shall I come and keep fast with you? Or will you come and see me? I should be glad to see you in this House, but there is another very near it, where I should rejoice much more to see you, and to live with you till we shall have lived enough to ourselves, to Glory,  [illegible]  Virtue and Mankind, and till both of us shall be desirous of Translation to a wiser, fairer, better World.    I am, and till then, and forever after will be your Admirer and Friend, and Lover,      "
Wednesday Eveng.[11 April 1764],"This is the last Opportunity I shall have to write you from  Braintree   for some Weeks. You may expect to hear from me, as soon after my Arrival at  Boston as possible. Have had a peaceable, pleasant Day upon the whole. My Brother and I have the Wishes, the good Wishes of all the good People who come to the House. They admire our Fortitude, and wish us well thro, even some, who would heartily rejoice to hear that both of Us were dead of the small Pox provided no others could be raised up in our stead to be a Terror to evil Doers, and a Praise  [and] Encouragement to such as they mortally hate, those that do well. But I have attained such an Elevation in  as to be rendered very little, the better or worse, more chearful  or surly, for the good or ill Wishes or Speeches of such Animals, as those. Amusement engages the most of my Attention. I mean that as I am necessitated to spend three or four Weeks in an Absolute Vacation of Business and study, I may not amuse myself, with such silly Trifles as Cards and Baubles altogether, but may make the very Expletives of Time, the very Diverters from Thinking,  while I am under the small Pox of some Use or Pleasure, to me, after  [I] get well. [For this] Purpose beg Papa, to lend me, all the Volumes of Swifts Examiner and send them over by Tom to   yr Love and Duty where, and in Proportion as, it is due.  "
 Thurdsdy. 5. Oclock.  [12 April ] 1764,"Diana I have Thoughts of sending you a Nest of Letters like a nest of ; tho I suspect the latter would be a more genteel and acceptable Present to a Lady. But in my present Circumstances I can much better afford the former than the latter. For, my own Discretion as well as the Prescriptions of the Faculty, prohibit any close Application of Mind to Books or Business-Amusement, Amusement is the only study that I follow. Now Letter-Writing is,  to me, the most agreable Amusement I can find: and Writing to you the most entertaining and Agreable of all Letter-Writing. So that a Nest of an hundred, would cost me Nothing at all. -- What say you my Dear? Are you not much obliged to me, for making you the cheapest of all possible Presents? Shall I continue to write you, so much, and so often after I get to Town? Shall I send you, an History of the whole Voyage? Shall I draw You the Characters of all, who visit me? Shall I describe to you all the Conversations I have? I am   about to make my Appearance on a new Theatre, new to me. I have never been much conversant in scenes, where Drs., Nurses, Watchers, &c. make the Principal Actors. It will be a Curiosity to me. Will it be so to you? I was always pleased to see human  Nature in a Variety of shapes. And if I should be much alone, and feel in tolerable Spirits, it will be a Diversion to commit my Observations to Writing. I believe I could furnish a Cabinet of Letters upon these subjects which would be exceeded in Curiosity, by nothing, but by a  describing the Characters, Diversions, Meals, Wit, Drollery, Jokes, Smutt, and Stories of a Tavern the Guests at a Tavern in  Plymouth where I lodge, when at that Court-which  [illegible]   could be equalled by nothing excepting a minute History of Close stools and Chamber Potts, and of the Operation of Pills, Potions and Powders, in the Preparation for the small Pox. Heaven forgive me for suffering my Imagination to straggle into a Region of Ideas so nauseous And abominable: and suffer me to return to my Project of writing you a journal. You would have a great Variety of Characters -- Lawyers, Physicians ( Divines I believe), a Number of Tradesmen, Country Colonells, Ladies, Girls, Nurses, Watchers, Children, Barbers &c. &c. &c. But among all These, there is but one whose Character I would give much to know better than I do at present. In a Word I am an old Fellow, and have seen so many Characters in my Day, that I am almost weary of Observing them. -- Yet I doubt whether I understand  human Nature or the World very well or not? There is not much Satisfaction in the study of Mankind to a benevolent Mind. It is a new Moon, Nineteen  of it  [illegible]   opaque and unenlightened. Intimacy with the most of People, will bring you acquainted with Vices and Errors, and Follies enough to make you  them. Nay Intimacy with the most celebrated will very much diminish our Reverence and Admiration. What say you now my dear shall I go on with my Design of Writing Characters? -- Answer as you please, there is one Character, that whether I draw it on Paper  or not, I cannot avoid thinking on every Hour, and considering sometimes together and sometimes  [illegible]   asunder, the Excellencies and Defects in it. It is almost the only one that has encreased, for many Years together, in Proportion to Acquaintance and Intimacy, in the Esteem, Love and Admiration of your  "
